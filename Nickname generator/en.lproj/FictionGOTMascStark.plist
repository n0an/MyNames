            Shireen Baratheon mentions that Dorren's tomb is in the ancient crypts underneath Winterfell, along with Brandon the Builder.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Dorren Stark is mentioned only in passing. According to legend, during the time of his rule the Night's Watch fought Giants and actively traded with the Children of the Forest.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dorren_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkDorrenStark</string></dict>
        <key>Jon Snow</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.2.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jon Snow, born Aegon Targaryen, is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, the late Prince of Dragonstone. From infancy, Jon is presented as the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother, and raised by Eddard alongside his lawful children at Winterfell but his true parentage is kept secret from everyone, including Jon himself. In order to escape his bastard status, Jon joins the Night's Watch and is eventually chosen as Lord Commander. However, he is later murdered in a mutiny and resurrected by the Red Priestess Melisandre. Freed from his Night's Watch vows, Jon joins his cousin, Sansa Stark, in building an army and together they retake Winterfell from House Bolton, restoring House Stark's dominion over the North with Jon being declared the new King in the North. However, after successfully capturing a wight and presenting it to the Lannisters as proof that the Army of the Dead are real, Jon pledges himself and his army to Daenerys Targaryen, Rhaegar's sister, and steps down as King of the North.[2]
            Eighteen years before the War of the Five Kings, Rhaegar Targaryen allegedly abducted Lyanna Stark of Winterfell in a scandal that would lead to the outbreak of Robert's Rebellion. Rhaegar would eventually return to fight in the war, but not before leaving Lyanna behind at the Tower of Joy, guarded by Lord Commander Gerold Hightower and Ser Arthur Dayne of the Kingsguard. Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother, rode to war along with her betrothed, Robert Baratheon, to rescue his sister and avenge the deaths of their father and brother on the orders of Rhaegar's father, Aerys II, the Mad King.
            Robert would ultimately kill Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident, effectively ensuring their victory in the war. After the Sack of King's Landing, Ned continued south in search of his sister and ultimately found her at the Tower of Joy in the Red Mountains at the border of Dorne. Ned and his companions engaged in a final fierce melee with the remaining Targaryen Kingsguard, which resulted in the deaths of all combatants save Ned himself and Howland Reed.[3]
            After defeating the last of the Kingsguard, Ned rushed into the tower to save his sister - only to find Lyanna dying from childbirth, having just given birth to Rhaegar's own son. Desperate to protect the life of her newborn child, a fading Lyanna pleaded with Ned to promise her that he would keep her son safe, and his true heritage hidden from Robert as he had been Rhaegar's most bitter enemy. Furthermore, the boy's existence was a potential threat to Robert's claim to the Iron Throne after the deaths of Rhaegar's other children, Rhaenys and Aegon, by his wife Elia Martell, who also perished, during the Sack of King's Landing. In accordance with her last wish, Ned resolved to pass Lyanna's son off as his own bastard son and raise him in his home castle - a great blow to his honor as he knew that his decision would shame both himself and his lady wife, Catelyn Tully.[4][5]
            Ned decided not to use his nephew's birth name, which Lyanna revealed to him in her final moments - apparently because it was a Targaryen-style name which would have given away his real parentage. Instead, he chose to give the baby the name "Jon" after his great friend and mentor Jon Arryn, Lord of the Vale, whom he loved like a second father. The boy also grew up using the surname "Snow", as is customary for acknowledged bastards in the North. In truth, however, "Jon" may not be a bastard at all. Rhaegar apparently had his marriage to Elia annulled and married another, presumably Lyanna.[6]
            Jon Snow spent the next seventeen years being raised in Winterfell as Lord Eddard's illegitimate son, alongside his trueborn children with his wife. Understandably, Eddard never told anyone, including Catelyn or Jon himself, who his mother was or even if she was still alive. When pressed by King Robert Baratheon, whom he couldn't deny an answer, Ned went as far as to concoct a vague explanation that Jon's mother was some lowborn woman named "Wylla" that he met during the war.[7] Lady Catelyn's eldest son, Robb, would be acknowledged unquestionably as Eddard's heir, but Jon was otherwise never treated much differently than her younger sons Bran and Rickon.
            Despite sharing a happy marriage, Jon's presence at Winterfell would serve as a constant source of friction between Eddard and Catelyn. Because Jon was never legitimized, Catelyn was never his "stepmother" in any sense of the term or had any obligations to him whatsoever. She never mistreated Jon but she was cold towards him and avoided him whenever possible, viewing him only as a living reminder of the one time that Eddard had dishonored her.[8][7] Catelyn would later confess to her daughter-in-law Talisa about how Jon caught the pox when he was a child, and she stayed with him through the night and prayed to the gods to let him live out of guilt for previously praying for his death, accepting that the boy was not to blame for her husband's sin, though it was still not enough to make her love Jon, something she would eventually come to regret.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Snow</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkJonSnow</string></dict>
        <key>Torrhen Stark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.3.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Torrhen Stark, also known as the King Who Knelt, was the last King in the North until the secession of the North and the Riverlands in the War of the Five Kings and the coronation of Robb Stark.
            King Torrhen's reign coincided with the War of Conquest, in which the Andal kingdoms south of the Neck submitted one by one to Aegon the Conqueror. Torrhen amassed his army and marched to meet the Targaryen warlord but by the time he arrived, Aegon had already won the decisive Field of Fire and conquered most of the South of Westeros.
            After seeing Aegon's dragons and his massive host, Torrhen realized the war was already lost.
            Instead of fighting, he chose to bend the knee and surrendered his crown in order to spare his people. For his submission, Aegon named him Lord Paramount and Warden of the North. Though some Northerners sneer at Torrhen as "the king who knelt", his descendants Robb and Sansa Stark argue that Torrhen "saved thousands of lives that day" and that his critics forget they are alive today because of him.[1][2]
            When Jon Snow appears before Daenerys Targaryen on Dragonstone, the latter scoffs when Ser Davos Seaworth presents Jon as the King in the North and declares that the last person who hold that title was Torrhen Stark, who bent the knee to her ancestor, Aegon the Conqueror (although this is technically incorrect as the last King in the North was Robb Stark).[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Torrhen Stark's story is the same. It is believed he knelt at the place where the Inn of the Kneeling Man sits at the time of the books.
            Torrhen's army numbered about 30,000 men but the Targaryen army that came to meet him numbered about 45,000 - nor did this represent all of Aegon's new bannermen, just the ones directly facing him. Moreover, the Targaryens had their three huge dragons. Torrhen's bastard brother, Brandon Snow, volunteered to sneak into the Targaryen camp at night and attempt to kill all three dragons while they slept but Torrhen judged that this was impossible and that the failed attempt would only invite further retaliation from the Targaryens, so he chose to surrender instead.
            Torrhen Stark's decision to kneel before Aegon Targaryen saved the North from the devastation inflicted upon the Gardeners and the Lannisters. The Conqueror not only confirmed the Starks as the rulers of the North but he also allowed them to keep their own customs: the Targaryens' laws would rule over the North, but they could keep their local custom of personally beheaded condemned men instead of delegating the task to an executioner. Queen Rhaenys Targaryen, as part of her efforts to keep the realm together after the Conquest, organized a marriage between Lord Stark's daughter and Lord Arryn. However, although Torrhen had bent the knee, his sons did not want to serve the Targaryens. It was only over their strong protests that the marriage took place and they refused to attend the marriage. The North remained in the realm so it can be assumed that Torrhen was able to prevent his sons from rising up against the Targaryens. It is unknown if Torrhen was still alive when Aegon visited Winterfell in 33 AC, during his last royal progress.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Torrhen_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkTorrhenStark</string></dict>
        <key>Rodrik Cassel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.4.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Rodrik Cassel was the Master-at-Arms at Winterfell and a loyal servant to House Stark. Even in his old age he was still a skilled warrior. He was executed by Theon Greyjoy during the fall of Winterfell.
            Ser Rodrik Cassel is Master-at-Arms at Winterfell and has trained many of its soldiers in the art of combat, as well as Robb Stark, Theon Greyjoy and Jon Snow, and formerly Ned and Benjen Stark. He is the primary military advisor to House Stark of Winterfell. House Stark are Lords Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm.[1]
            Rodrik is a knight, which is somewhat unusual in the North where most of the population holds to the Old Gods of the Forest. He fought in Robert's Rebellion and is an old friend of both Lord Eddard Stark and Jon Umber, the Lord of Last Hearth. His nephew Jory Cassel also fought in the rebellion and is the Captain of the guards at Winterfell. Rodrik is much beloved and respected by the inhabitants of Winterfell, and bears a distinct "muttonchop" facial hair pattern.
            Ser Rodrik informs Lord Eddard Stark that Will, a deserter from the Night's Watch, has been caught in the hills. He accompanies Eddard to Will's execution. On the way back to Winterfell he witnesses the discovery of the six direwolf pups in the Wolfswood. The Stark children adopt the pups. King Robert Baratheon visits Winterfell and Ser Rodrik assembles with the rest of the household to welcome him. Robert asks Eddard to serve as hand of the King. Bran Stark is found severely injured at the base of a disused tower.[2] Eddard goes south to King's Landing and Jory accompanies him as the Captain of his personal guard while Rodrik remains in Winterfell. An assassin infiltrates the castle and attempts to kill Bran but is foiled by Catelyn and Bran's direwolf Summer. Rodrik identifies the blade carried by the assassin as Valyrian steel. Catelyn suspects House Lannister and decides to warn Eddard personally. Rodrik offers to send a squad of guards with her but she is concerned about drawing attention. He offers to accompany her personally and she agrees.[3]
            Rodrik and Catelyn arrive in King's Landing. He escorts her during through the city and they are told that Littlefinger lost the blade used by the assassin gambling with Tyrion Lannister.[4] They set out for Winterfell. At the Inn at the Crossroads, Rodrik unsuccessfully attempts to dismiss the singer Marillion. He helps Catelyn take Tyrion Lannister prisoner when he arrives at the inn.[5]
            They head east through the Vale of Arryn. Rodrik helps fend off an attack by the hill tribes and receives a minor wound, but is able to complete the journey to the Eyrie. Rodrik's nephew Jory Cassel is killed by Jaime Lannister while protecting Eddard in King's Landing.[6]
            Rodrik witnesses Tyrion's trial by combat and is disappointed when Tyrion's champion wins.[7] King Robert dies following a hunting mishap and Eddard questions the lineage of his successor, Joffrey Baratheon. Eddard is arrested for treason and held in the dungeons of King's Landing[8] until the newly-crowned King Joffrey orders him beheaded, prompting the North to secede and rise in anger and rebellion. Rodrik accompanies Catelyn to Moat Cailin, where they find Robb Stark's army camped, where he greets Jon Umber like a longtime friend.[9] Robb needs to cross the river Trident but is unsure of the support of Lord Walder Frey. Rodrik advises Catelyn to not go into the Twins alone to talk to Lord Frey. She does so anyway and negotiates safe passage. Robb wins a victory in the Battle of the Whispering Wood and captures Jaime.[10] News of Eddard's execution reaches the camp and Rodrik is part of the group that proclaims Robb Stark the King in the North.[11]
            Ser Rodrik is present when King Robb presents Ser Alton Lannister the peace terms he must deliver to the Iron Throne. Robb sends Ser Rodrik back to Winterfell to keep Bran and Rickon safe while Catelyn goes to the Stormlands to treat with King Renly Baratheon.[12]
            Ser Rodrik enters the Great Hall of Winterfell calling for Bran. He reports that Torrhen’s Square is under siege. Maester Luwin is shocked, remarking that Torrhen’s Square is just 14 leagues away and wonders how the Lannisters have reached so far north. Osha listens intently as she lights candles at the back of the room. Ser Rodrik speculates that it could be a raiding party led by the Mountain or a group of sellswords. Bran says that they must help their bannermen. Rodrik nods agreement and says that even with most of their forces fighting for Robb he can gather 200 decent men. Luwin wonders if Rodrik needs to take so many and Bran cautions that they must protect their bannermen if they expect their bannermen to protect them. Rodrik smiles at the boy’s wisdom and Bran orders him to leave as soon as he has his men. Rodrik confidently says that it will not take long because southerners do not do well in their territory.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rodrik_Cassel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkRodrikCassel</string></dict>

            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, King Rodrik Stark's story is the same. Presumably he took Bear Island from the ironborn, who under the rule of Qhored Hoare ruled much of the western coast of Westeros, from Bear Island to the Arbor.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rodrik_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkRodrikStark</string></dict>
        <key>Eddard Stark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.6.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Eddard Stark, also known as Ned Stark, was the head of House Stark, the Lord of Winterfell, Lord Paramount and Warden of the North, and later Hand of the King to King Robert I Baratheon. He was the older brother of Benjen, Lyanna and the younger brother of Brandon Stark. He is the father of Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon by his wife, Catelyn Tully, and uncle of Jon Snow, who he raised as his bastard son. He was a dedicated husband and father, a loyal friend and an honorable lord.
            Eddard's execution and revealing the illegitimacy of Cersei's children was the spark of the War of the Five Kings between Joffrey Baratheon, Robb, Renly Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon and Balon Greyjoy, being posthumously responsible for the involvement of four of the kings in this war.
            Eddard Stark was the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms, and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell, and Eddard also held the title Lord of Winterfell. In addition, he was the Warden of the North.[1]
            Eddard was the second son of Lord Rickard Stark. Lord Rickard served King Aerys II Targaryen as Warden of the North. Eddard's older brother Brandon was Rickard's heir. Eddard also has a younger sister Lyanna and a younger brother Benjen. Eddard was a stoic, dutiful, and honorable man and was considered to embody the values of the North.[2]
            Eddard was a trusted, close friend and counselor of King Robert Baratheon.[2] He supported Robert's play for the throne by acting as a general in several major battles. Eddard's sister, Lyanna, who was betrothed to Robert, was purportedly kidnapped by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, igniting a war. Brandon protested the kidnapping, but his attempt to bring Rhaegar to justice failed. Lord Rickard was summoned to court in King's Landing by Aerys, and both Brandon and Rickard were brutally executed by the Mad King.[3]
            Their deaths left Eddard to inherit Rickard's responsibilities, serving King Robert instead. Brandon had been betrothed to Catelyn, and Eddard also inherited his brother's bride.[4][4][5] Lyanna died in Eddard's arms during the conflict.[6] Despite his happy family life, Eddard still felt the losses of his family quite keenly, often visiting his sister's tomb to light a candle for her as his daughter, Sansa, remembered.[7] Despite barely knowing each other, Eddard and Catelyn formed a strong and loving marriage, and had five children, Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Eddard also had a supposed illegitimate son, Jon Snow, apparently fathered with a common serving girl Wylla, and raised Jon as his son alongside his legitimate children in Winterfell. In reality, Jon is Eddard's nephew since he is the son of Eddard's sister Lyanna Stark with Rhaegar Targaryen. Eddard kept this secret from everyone, including Catelyn, to protect Jon - especially from Robert Baratheon. This would become a source of occasional friction between Eddard and Catelyn, who remained ignorant to Jon's true origins.
            Eddard's younger brother Benjen joined the Night's Watch, an institution of which Eddard was a keen supporter.[8] He also appeared to have troubles keeping his bannermen in line as Stannis Baratheon remembered his brother Robert saying the Northmen were difficult to control, even with Eddard on his side.[9]
            Eddard wielded a Valyrian greatsword named Ice (an heirloom of House Stark) which he used on ceremonial occasions.
            Eddard Stark executes a deserter from the Night's Watch named Will. Will tries to warn Eddard about the return of the White Walkers, but Eddard dismisses him as a madman. Eddard's sons Robb, Bran, and Jon accompany him to the execution. Eddard makes a point of telling Bran that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword and take responsibility for his own decisions.[10]
            On the way back to Winterfell, the party finds a dead stag and a dead female direwolf. The direwolf was survived by her litter of six pups. Eddard's first instinct is to kill them, but Jon argues that as the direwolf is the sigil of House Stark, this may be an omen. Eddard agrees to let his children look after them on the condition that they clean, raise, and feed them with no help from the servants.[10]
            A raven bears news of the death of Jon Arryn, Eddard's childhood mentor, to Winterfell. The missive also states that King Robert and much of the royal court is on their way to the castle. Eddard realizes that Robert means to name him as Hand of the King to replace Jon. He ponders refusing, but when Robert arrives he makes it clear that he badly needs Eddard's help in King's Landing. He also sweetens the deal by offering to betroth his son and heir Joffrey to Eddard's daughter Sansa. Eddard remains uncertain until a secret letter from Lysa Arryn, Catelyn's sister, implicates the Lannisters in the death of Jon Arryn.
            Eddard decides to accept to investigate both Jon's death and a potential plot against the king. He decides to bring both of his daughters to introduce them to the court.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Eddard_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkEddardStark</string></dict>

            Henk and Koner are stationed at the front gate of Winterfell when Arya Stark arrives. Henk asks her what she is doing there and tells her to leave when she replies that she will be entering the castle. He and Koner laugh when she tells them who she is, stating that Arya Stark is dead. She asks for Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik Cassel, but they reply their is nobody with those names at Winterfell. She then asks for Jon Snow, and Henk informs her that Jon is a thousand miles away. They insist that she leave, but to their annoyance she asks who is in charge of the castle, and they inform her that it is Sansa Stark. Henk gives her a final warning and grabs for her, but she easily avoids him. Arya warns them what will happen if Sansa finds out that they turned her sister away and they agree to let her in. They argue over which of them will watch Arya and which of them will report to Sansa, and while they are distracted Arya disappears. They both reported to Sansa and told her who Arya had been asking for, with Henk insisting that she not not concern herself with the matter as she was probably an imposter from the winter town. Henk promised they would find her, though Sansa replied that they did not have to, as she knew where Arya had gone.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Henk</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkHenk</string></dict>
        <key>Farlen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.8.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Farlen was the kennelmaster at Winterfell.
            Farlen is the kennelmaster at Winterfell. He has a daughter, Palla.[1]
            After Winterfell is seized by ironborn raiders led by Theon Greyjoy, Farlen is among the members of the Stark household forcibly assembled at the castle's yard to witness Prince Bran's official yielding to Theon. Farlen refuses to serve Theon, and insists he's a servant of House Stark. One of the ironborn raiders, Drennan, beats him over the head with a club. He is helped up off the ground by his daughter Palla.[1] They are both present when Theon Greyjoy assembles the people after the escape of Bran and Rickon Stark and unveils two charred corpses and hangs them up on either side of the castle gates.[2]
            Farlen and his daughter were likely put to sword by Ramsay Bolton's men during the Sack of Winterfell, as they are never to be seen again after Winterfell is retaken and House Stark are restored as the ruling house of the North.
            In A Song of Ice and Fire, Farlen is also the loyal kennelmaster of Winterfell. It was not him but Mikken the blacksmith who talked defiantly to Theon Greyjoy, and was killed for that. Farlen was falsely accused by Theon of killing three of the ironborn (who were actually killed by Ramsay Snow at Theon's command), and was beheaded by Theon. In the TV series, he was replaced by Ser Rodrik Cassel at the execution scene.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Farlen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkFarlen</string></dict>

            He accompanies Eddard Stark south to King's Landing when he becomes Hand of the King, and is usually seen guarding him with Jory Cassel. He is with Eddard when Renly Baratheon brings news of Robert Baratheon's hunting injury. Eddard instructs Tomard to hand deliver a letter to Stannis Baratheon. Tomard is not present when Eddard and the majority of his guard are killed.[1] He escapes from the capital and successfully delivers the letter, and he is one of very few if any to have survived the Massacre in the Red Keep, where the entire Stark Household in King's Landing was obliterated.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tomard is nicknamed Fat Tom. He is easily fooled and prone to stating the obvious. He becomes the Captain of Eddard Stark's personal guard, following the death of Jory Cassel and the departure of Jory's replacement Alyn with Lord Beric Dondarrion. As in the show, he is entrusted to deliver a letter to Stannis Baratheon, but is explicitly told to do so during a sea journey North with Eddard's daughters. Unlike in the show, he is killed along with the majority of the guards when Eddard is betrayed by Littlefinger in the Throne Room. The letter is taken from his body, and later presented to Sansa Stark as evidence to her father's alleged treason. As the letter is successfully delivered to Stannis Baratheon in the show, Tomard is not killed and remains alive in the TV continuity. His destination after he completes his assignment is unknown.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tomard</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkTomard</string></dict>
        <key>Theon Stark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.11.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Theon Stark was King in the North during the Andal Invasion of Westeros.
            During the Andal Invasion, the unified northern lords under House Stark were able to keep them out, and King Theon sailed his own fleet to the Andal homeland Andalos for vengeance. There, he killed hundreds of Andal warriors, and upon returning home, he placed their heads on spikes along the northern coasts as a warning to anyone attempting to conquer the North.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire books, King Theon is depicted in the crypt of Winterfell as gaunt with long hair and a skinny appearance. His appearance as well as the constant state of war during his reign earned him the nickname, the Hungry Wolf. With the aid of House Bolton, he defeated the Andal warlord Argos Sevenstar at the Battle of the Weeping Water. He then sailed across the Narrow Sea with Argos's body displayed on the prow of his ship like a figurehead and burned a score of Andal villages, killing hundreds and displaying the spiked heads of his slain enemies along his coastline to discourage future invaders.
            When Harrag Hoare, King of the Iron Islands, invaded the western coast of the North during Theon's reign, conquering the Stony Shore and burning the Wolfswood. His son, Ravos "the Reaper" Hoare, took Bear Island but Theon eventually slew him and expelled the ironborn as well.
            At one point in A Dance with Dragons, Theon Greyjoy refers to Theon Stark as his namesake.

            Syrio Forel is a bravo and master sword-fighter, originally from the Free City of Braavos where he spent nine years as the First Sword of the city, before relocating to King's Landing.
            After arriving in King's Landing, Lord Eddard Stark discovers that his daughter Arya owns a sword (Needle, a gift from her half-brother Jon Snow), but has not been properly trained to use it. He hires Syrio Forel to train Arya in its use. Forel accepts the commission and begins to train Arya in how to use the sword in the Braavosi style, known as the Water Dance. Arya's lessons are kept a secret; her sister Sansa believes that Arya is getting "dancing lessons".[2]
            Eddard finds Arya balancing on the top of some stairs. She tells him that Syrio set her the task to improve her balance.[3] Arya chases cats to improve her dexterity and speed on Syrio's suggestion.[4]
            Syrio and Arya have another lesson, but Arya is distracted by the death of her friend Mycah and the wounding of her father duing a fight with Jaime Lannister. Syrio tells her that she is more vulnerable when she is "with her trouble" rather than concentrating on the here and now. He teaches her how to forget her troubles so she can concentrate on fighting.[5]
            After Eddard's arrest for treason, Lannister guards led by Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard arrive to take Arya into custody. Suspicious, Syrio motions for Arya to stay behind him and asks why Lord Stark would send Lannister men for his daughter; Arya sees Syrio's point and refuses to go with them. When one guard tries to barge past, Syrio disarms him. Armed only with a wooden training sword, he deftly fights off a mass attack by the guardsmen, immobilizing all of them. He then engages Ser Meryn, who breaks his wooden sword. Syrio instructs Arya to flee. When she asks him to come with her, he tells her, "The First Sword of Braavos does not run." Arya flees, and (unseen) Syrio and Ser Meryn continue their fight.[6]
            Arya believes Syrio to be dead, and tells the Hound that he was killed by Ser Meryn Trant. Sandor proceeds to mock Syrio, claiming that Trant is a poor fighter, and that "Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants".[7]
            Arya finally exacts vengeance for Syrio when she kills Meryn Trant at a brothel in Braavos.
            Mastering the technique of the Braavosi Water Dance, Syrio Forel was eccentric and confident in his movements and words, showing himself fearless and flamboyant. Arya Stark states that he was one of the greatest swordsmen that ever lived; this is proven true as he single-handedly defeated five armored Kingsguard with a wooden training sword. Syrio never wore armor in combat and preferred light weaponry, as the Water Dance strongly relies on agility and being light on one's feet. He often used his enemies use of armor to his advantage in a fight, wearing them down and outmaneuvering them with his speed before finishing them off. Syrio's lack of armor and strong weapons, however, might have resulted in his downfall against Meryn Trant. Sandor Clegane jests that even through Syrio might have been "the greatest swordsman who ever lived", he lost to the cowardly and weak Trant solely because the knight had a big sword and armor. Syrio's teaching style could be considered unusual but effective. During lessons with Arya, he taught her that in combat the sword and the one holding it should be one, and to teach her mobility and dexterity, had her chase cats around the Red Keep.
            Syrio seemed to lack faith in the Old Gods and the New, claiming the only true God is Death, as everyone succumbs to Him eventually. He possesses a warrior's belief in this, however, claiming that the only thing one says to Death is "not today". Courageous, implacable and fearsome, Syrio showed no visible fear even when faced with Meryn Trant and deprived of his only weapon's effectiveness. Syrio had a very observant view on Westerosi combat, considering it to be little more than hacking and hammering, in that it lacked elegance or precision (An opinion only acceptable from a master swordsman, naturally), and he had a sense of honour as evidenced by his disgust that Meryn Trant's men would have the gall to threaten a little girl. Syrio Forel was obviously quite charismatic, as he inspired Arya's behaviour after his death: She was motivated to kill Meryn Trant for killing Syrio, and continued to utilise his lessons after he allowed her to escape from Cersei Lannister's men.
            Braavos and the Free Cities are loosely similar to the medieval Italian city-states, vaguely "Mediterranean", so actor Miltos Yerolemou, a Greek Cypriot based in London, portrayed Syrio with an accent "a little Greek, a little Italian and a little Spanish, and then pushed it East into Persia".[8] Given the diverse polyglot nature of Braavos, there is no way of taking Syrio's on-screen accent as "typical" of all Braavosi (the way that Cersei could recognize Shae's Lorath accent). The Spanish dub of the TV series produced in Spain renders Syrio's speech as an Arabic accent, to try to maintain the impression that he is a foreigner to Westeros.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Syrio_Forel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkSyrioForel</string></dict>
        <key>Robb Stark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.13.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Robb Stark was the eldest son of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell and his wife, Lady Catelyn. He was the older brother of Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon Stark, and cousin (believed to be half-brother) of Jon Snow. He also adopted a direwolf, whom he named Grey Wind. Robb was declared King in the North, the first since his ancestor Torrhen Stark bent the knee three centuries before, during the War of the Five Kings, after the execution of his father by King Joffrey Baratheon.
            Robb and his advisors meet with "Black Walder" and Lothar Frey to discuss an alliance for his planned attack on Casterly Rock. The Freys carry Walder Frey's demands for an alliance, which includes a formal apology from Robb, the castle Harrenhal and all of its lands and incomes, and for Edmure to marry Roslin, one of his daughters. Edmure is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met, but is eventually convinced by the group to go through with the arrangement."The Climb" In the Riverlands, en route to The Twins, Robb's army is forced to make camp, their progress delayed by heavy rain. Catelyn warns them that the prickly Lord Frey will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him, but Edmure points out that Frey is getting the wedding he wanted; his sister counters that he is getting a wedding, but not the one he wanted, glaring at her son and his wife as she says so, pointing out that Frey wanted one of his daughters wed to a king. Robb retorts that Edmure is the best match House Frey has been offered in its history. Later that night as Robb and Talisa prepare for bed, she reveals that she is pregnant with his child. Robb is gladdened by the news."[19]
            Meanwhile, the priestess Melisandre performs a ritual using leeches filled with fresh blood forcibly taken from Gendry, Robert Baratheon's bastard son. At her direction, Stannis Baratheon then throws the leeches onto a fire and recites the names of three people he wants dead: "The usurper Robb Stark, the usurper Balon Greyjoy, the usurper Joffrey Baratheon."[20]
            Robb's army arrives at the Twins, the castle seat of House Frey, for his uncle Edmure's wedding. Enduring Lord Walder Frey's insults directed at him and his wife, Robb makes a public apology to Lord Frey's daughters and granddaughters for breaking his promise to marry one of them. Frey accepts the apology and offers the Starks and their men his hospitality. That night Edmure is introduced to his bride Roslin Frey, discovering much to his relief that she is a beauty. The wedding and the feast that follows it are quite celebratory and lively affairs, with all the participants in high spirits. As the celebrations reach their heights Lord Walder calls for the bedding ceremony. Robb agrees and the bride and groom are carried off to their wedding bed, Roslin carried off by the male guests and followed closely by Edmure, who is collected by the Frey women.
            As the massacre of Robb's army rages outside the Twins, Robb's body is paraded atop a horse across the keep, with the head removed and replaced with that of his direwolf, Grey Wind, sewn in its place as a final act of mockery to the King in the North. This sight is witnessed by Arya and Sandor Clegane during their escape. Later on, Arya and Sandor come across a group of camping Frey soldiers, one of which is describing the process of sewing Grey Wind's head onto Robb's body. Arya stabs the man to death while Sandor kills the rest, exacting a small vengeance for Robb.[22]
            Later on, after receiving a raven from Walder Frey with news of the massacre, Tywin summons Tyrion who finds his father in the company of an overjoyed Joffrey along with his mother, Varys and Pycelle. Tyrion reads the letter, at first not knowing what it means, but Joffrey bluntly tells him the news that Robb and his mother are dead, and asks Pycelle to write back to Lord Frey to thank him and command him to send him Robb's head, in order to serve it to Sansa at his wedding feast. After a brief altercation between Joffrey and Tywin, the king is escorted to his chambers and Tyrion is left alone with Tywin, revealing his knowledge of Tywin's involvement in the massacre by promising Walder Frey and Roose Bolton protection from the Northern outrage that is soon to come. Tyrion chides his father for such a dishonorable way to end the war, but Tywin justifies this by claiming that it was to protect their family. After their conversation ends bitterly, Tyrion immediately returns to a tearful Sansa, who has discovered the news of her mother's and brother's deaths as well.[22]
            At the wedding feast of King Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell, Lady Olenna Tyrell briefly consoles Sansa about the Red Wedding, noting that despite it being a time of war, it was still horrid to murder someone in such a disgusting manner, and at a wedding no less, even though ironically Olenna commits a similar crime only moments later by poisoning and subsequently murdering Joffrey at his own wedding feast. Later on in the feast, King Joffrey offers a mock reenactment of the War of the Five Kings with dwarf performers (an insult to Tyrion). One dwarf wears a fake wolf head over his head and constantly yells "I'm the King in the North!", only to end up "beheaded" by the dwarf portraying Joffrey. Much to Sansa's disgust and heartache, the dwarf Joffrey then simulates having intercourse with the decapitated "wolf head". Joffrey is assassinated moments later, ironically perishing at his own wedding feast whereas Robb did at his uncle's wedding."[24]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robb_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkRobbStark</string></dict>
        <key>Rickard Stark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.14.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Rickard Stark was the Lord of Winterfell, the Warden of the North and head of House Stark until he was executed along with his son Brandon by the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen. He was the father of Brandon, Eddard, Lyanna and Benjen Stark. Both Rickard Stark and the Mad King are grandfathers to Jon Snow.
            He served under King Aerys II (known as the Mad King). He is the father of Brandon, Eddard, Lyanna and Benjen Stark. He arranged for the betrothal of his daughter Lyanna Stark to Robert Baratheon, the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. He also betrothed his son and heir Brandon Stark to Catelyn Tully, the daughter of Hoster Tully, Lord Paramount of the Riverlands. Both engagements were broken when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen abducted Lyanna.
            When Lyanna was kidnapped by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the son of the King, Rickard's eldest son and heir, Brandon, rode to King's Landing seeking justice. Aerys II imprisoned Brandon and ordered that Rickard ride south to answer for his son's impertinence. Against advice, Rickard agreed, assuming that the matter would be settled through a trial or a bargain of some kind. Instead, Aerys had Lord Rickard burned alive while Brandon watched, and then had Brandon strangled.[2]
            Aerys then ordered Jon Arryn to hand over his ward and new Lord of Winterfell Eddard Stark. Having sworn a sacred oath to protect Eddard, Jon instead rose his banners in rebellion. He was supported by the North, Lyanna's betrothed Robert Baratheon, and Hoster Tully. This sparked the beginning of the war known as Robert's Rebellion, which led to the near-destruction of House Targaryen and its removal from the Iron Throne.[3]
            Reaching King's Landing, Lord Eddard Stark is greeted by Ser Jaime Lannister in the throne room, who recalls listening to Eddard's father and brother scream as hundreds watched them die at the whim of the Mad King. He suggests his assassination of the Mad King was an act of justice, but Eddard dismisses that as a paltry self-justification for breaking his solemn Kingsguard vows.[4]
            Rickard is indirectly mentioned together with his son and heir Brandon on two separate occasions to Daenerys Targaryen, the Mad King's last surviving child.
            Barristan Selmy vaguely alludes to their deaths when he tells her about how her father murdered sons in front of their fathers and how his actions led to a rebellion that killed every Targaryen, save for Daenerys and her other brother Viserys, who has also since died.[5]
            Later, when Tyrion Lannister is advising Daenerys about her strategy of reclaiming the Iron Throne, he points out her lack of support by the Great Houses. As he lists them, he reminds her that House Stark is gone due to the actions of their "two terrible fathers" though he doesn't discuss the specifics - her father executing Rickard and Brandon and his father orchestrating the Red Wedding.[6].
            Bran Stark, with the aid of the Three-eyed Raven, has a greensight vision in which he witnesses Lord Rickard advise the young Ned Stark prior to his departure from Winterfell to be fostered in the Eyrie. Rickard advises his son to comport himself with dignity and stay out of fights, but implores him to win if he must fight. Seeing and hearing his grandfather for the first time brings a smile to Bran's face.[7]
            When Jon Snow agrees to meet with Daenerys Targaryen to discuss an alliance, Sansa Stark angrily reminds her half-brother (in reality cousin) what Daenerys's father, the Mad King, did to their grandfather, Lord Rickard.[8] When Jon refuses to bend the knee to Daenerys, he reminds her of how her father executed his grandfather and uncle. Daenerys owes that her father was an evil man and asks forgiveness for the crimes he committed against House Stark.[9]
            After the execution of Randyll and Dickon Tarly following the Battle on the Goldroad, Varys compares Daenerys to Aerys, as he did the same with Rickard and Brandon Stark. Varys then implores Tyrion to make her listen, fearing that this will make her be viewed in a similar vision to her father.[10]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Rickard's role is unchanged. His wife Lyarra, with whom we had his four aforementioned children, was his first cousin once removed (her name was already "Lyarra Stark" before they were married). Her father was named Rodrik Stark, and he was the younger brother of Rickard's grandfather Willam Stark. First cousin marriage is not considered incest in Westeros.
            In A Clash of Kings, Jaime Lannister explains to Catelyn Stark just how he died: Rickard demanded trial by combat to clear his son's name, assuming he would face a Kingsguard such as Jaime, but the Mad King had him locked in a cage with fire spewing beneath it, saying "Fire is the champion of House Targaryen" and mockingly offering that all he had to do to win the trial was not to burn. When Brandon tried to stop his father's death, he ended up strangling himself due to the device the Targaryen men had strapped him to. Jaime did not say how many knights were present, only that Gerold Hightower was there, and (having noticed Jaime's visible disgust at the proceedings) told him afterwards that they were sworn to defend the king, not to judge him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rickard_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkRickardStark</string></dict>
        <key>Rickon Stark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.15.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rickon Stark was the youngest child and third son of Eddard and Catelyn Stark.
            Rickon is the fifth child and youngest son of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Eddard is the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell while Eddard holds the title of Lord of Winterfell. He is also the Warden of the North to King Robert Baratheon.[2]
            Rickon was born and raised at Winterfell. He has two older brothers, Robb and Bran, and two older sisters, Sansa and Arya. He also has an older "bastard half-brother", Jon Snow. He is six-years-old when his uncle, Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, mysteriously dies.[3]
            King Robert dies following a hunting accident. His son Joffrey Baratheon claims the throne. Eddard challenges his legitimacy and is arrested for treason. Robb decides to ride against King Joffrey and wants to bid his younger brothers goodbye, but Rickon is nowhere to be found. Afterwards, Bran tries to reassure Rickon that Robb will return along with their parents, but Rickon wistfully replies, "No, they won't."[6]
            Rickon sees his father in the crypts below Winterfell in a dream. He goes down to the crypts with Shaggydog to look for him. He meets Bran, who also had a dream about his father being there. When Bran emerges from the crypts, Maester Luwin tells him that their father has been killed.[7]
            In the great hall of Winterfell, Prince Bran Stark holds court for his people. He remains the acting Lord of Winterfell and wears a gorget embossed with the direwolf of House Stark about his neck while the House Tully pin fastens his doublet. Meanwhile, Rickon sits beside his older brother, shelling nuts loudly with a rock. A shepherd reports being unable to tend to his flock with his three sons fighting in the south. He reassures Bran of the loyalty of his sons but says that there are growing numbers of wolves in the north and that he cannot protect his sheep from them alone. Bran offers to assign two orphans from Winterfell’s outlying Winterstown to aid him if he will give them room and board. The shepherd gratefully accepts, saying that his wife always wanted more children. When the shepherd leaves, Bran tells Rickon to stop. Having seen everyone, Bran tells Maester Luwin that he is going to go for a ride before dark and calls for Hodor.
            Ser Rodrik Cassel enters the Great Hall calling for Bran. He reports that Torrhen’s Square is under siege. Luwin is shocked, remarking that Torrhen’s Square is just 14 leagues away and wonders how the Lannisters have reached so far north. The two brothers' Free Folk servant, Osha, listens intently as she lights candles at the back of the room. Ser Rodrik speculates that it could be a raiding party led by the Mountain or a group of sellswords. Bran says that they must help their bannermen. Rodrik nods in agreement and says that even with most of their forces fighting for Robb, he can gather 200 decent men. Luwin wonders if Rodrik needs to take so many, and Bran cautions that they must protect their bannermen if they expect their bannermen to protect them. Rodrik smiles at the boy’s wisdom and Bran orders him to leave as soon as he has his men. Rodrik confidently says that it will not take long because southerners do not do well in their territory.[8]
            The attack is a feint orchestrated by Theon Greyjoy to lure away the garrison of Winterfell. He seizes the poorly defended castle and forces Bran to surrender to him by threatening the people. Rickon is distraught when Theon publicly executes Rodrik. Along with Bran, he tries to plead for Rodrik's life but to no avail. Osha manages to free Bran and Rickon and leads them out of the castle.[9] They reach the shepherd's farm in the Winterstown. Rickon remembers that Bran sent Billy and Jack there and wants to approach them for food. Bran is cautious about putting them in danger if they are tracked. Bran's concern proves valid when Theon later reaches the farm but cannot find Bran or Rickon. He brutalizes the shepherd and then returns to Winterfell with the charred corpses of two boys, claiming that they are Bran and Rickon.[10] The escapees actually back tracked through the stream and are hiding in the crypts at Winterfell. Luwin correctly deduces that the bodies must be the orphans from the farm. Rickon is described as being aged six by Yara Greyjoy when she learns of their deaths.[11]
            A Bolton force led by Roose's bastard son, Ramsay Snow, besieges Winterfell, trapping Theon's meager Ironborn garrison. The Ironborn turn on Theon and accept Robb Stark's offer to spare their lives in return for surrendering. However, the House Bolton forces flay the Ironborn alive and sack Winterfell. Following the Sack of Winterfell, Rickon and his companions emerge from the crypt to discover Winterfell in ruins. They also find a dying Maester Luwin resting under the willow tree. While Bran and Rickon offer to bring medicine to treat Luwin's wounds, he declines their offer and tells them to gather all of their warm clothing and travel north to Castle Black, where they would be safe with their half-brother, Jon Snow. At Luwin's own request, Osha euthanizes the elderly maester after the boys leave with Hodor. Rickon then travels north, accompanied by his older brother, Bran; their guardian, Osha; Hodor; and their two direwolves.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rickon_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkRickonStark</string></dict>

            Osric Stark is remembered by the Night's Watch since he was chosen as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch at the age of 10.[1] He was a close relative of a King in the North and served for 60 years.[2]
            Osric's Hill, near Craster's Keep, may have been named after him.[3]
            Samwell Tarly, knowing that a Choosing will be occurring soon, decides to read about the history of past Lord Commanders. He is amazed that Osric was chosen at such a young age.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Osric Stark was elected Lord Commander of the Night's Watch at age ten, four hundred years before the War of Conquest, though he ultimately served as Lord Commander for sixty years.
            Samwell Tarly specifically brings up the example of Osric Stark to point out that in the centuries-long history of the Night's Watch, boys younger than Jon Snow (who is around 16 years old at that point) have been elected as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Osric_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkOsricStark</string></dict>

Later Mikken assembles with the Winterfell household to receive King Robert Baratheon. He stands behind Maester Luwin.[1] Mikken forges the sword, Needle, for Jon Snow to give to his sister, Arya Stark.[2] Eddard Stark finds Arya with the sword and recognizes Mikken's maker's mark on it.[3]

        <key>Cregan Stark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.19.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cregan Stark was a Lord of Winterfell and an ancestor of House Stark.
            Cregan Stark once fought with Aemon Targaryen the Dragonknight, Prince of House Targaryen, member of the Kingsguard and one of the greatest swordsmen of his age, and was only barely defeated.
            His name is mentioned within the entry of Aemon Targaryen in The Book of Brothers.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cregan Stark's background is the same. Aemon Targaryen afterwards remarked that he never met a finer swordsman.
            He was the Lor​d of Winterfell during the Dance of the Dragons and supported Rhaenyra Targaryen's claim to the Iron Throne. Rhaenyra's son, Jacaerys Velaryon, came to Winterfell on dragon back and convinced Lord Stark to support his mother's claim in exchange for a marriage pact between Houses Stark and Targaryen. He sent his bannerman, Lord Roderick Dustin of House Dustin along with 2,000 men known as the Winter Wolves to support the Queen's claim while he remained in the North to gather his own banners (due to the vastness of the North this would take long). As winter was fast approaching and it promised to be long and hard, he assembled an army of second sons, old men, and any person who didn't want to burden their House with another mouth to feed.
            After Queen Rhaenyra's death at the hands of her brother Aegon II, the war continued between the supporters of the dead queen and the king's remaining loyalists. Out of the long war, only the North, the Vale, the Stormlands and Dorne had been spared loss. Both the North and the Vale still supported the claim of Rhaenyra's son, Aegon III, while Dorne was neutral and the Stormlands followed Aegon II. Lord Stark moved south with his army to overthrow Aegon II and place Rhaenyra's son on the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, Lord Borros Baratheon was marching north with his own banners but he was defeated on the Kingsroad by the riverlords known as the Lads before Lord Stark arrived. Having failed to get the battle he wanted, Stark nevertheless wanted to punish those who had supported Aegon II. He moved his forces to claim King's Landing where he found that Aegon II had been poisoned and Aegon III was now king. Since he was aged eleven, a regency needed to be established and several lords were vying for power. However, with his army, Lord Stark was the most powerful man in King's Landing.
            With his newfound power, Lord Stark wanted to punish those who had supported Aegon II such as the Baratheons, the Lannisters and the Hightowers. However, Lord Corlys Velaryon had already sent envoys to Oldtown, Storm's End and Casterly Rock to make peace. While word of the envoys was being waited upon, there was another matter that Lord Stark wanted to deal with: the assassination of Aegon II. While he had believed that he had been a usurper and had been riding south to oust him from power, Lord Stark did not believe in murdering him but rather in defeating him on the field of battle. He declared that all those who had partaken in the killing needed to be punished. His troops arrested several people in the capital, including Lord Velaryon, Lord Larys Strong, the Master of Whisperers, and several members of the Kingsguard. After these arrests were made, Lord Stark was appointed Hand of the King by King Aegon III. During the day that followed his appointment, Lord Stark led the trials and execution of the traitors, sending most to the Wall and executing a member of the Kingsguard and Lord Strong. Lord Velaryon escaped execution or sentence when the king issued an edict that he was to be spared and returned to his former dignity as Lord of the Tides. The day following the trials, Lord Stark resigned as Hand and left King's Landing for Winterfell. This event came to be known as the 'Hour of the Wolf' or the 'Judgment of the Wolf'. Lord Stark also left King's Landing with a new wife: Alysanne Blackwood, the aunt of the Lord of Raventree Hill.
            It was during Cregan's long reign as Lord of Winterfell that House Stark's loyalty to the Iron Throne (doubtful at best prior to this) became a certainty.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cregan_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkCreganStark</string></dict>

Koner and Henk laugh when she tells them who she is, stating that Arya Stark is dead. She asks for Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik Cassel, but they reply their is nobody with those names at Winterfell. She then asks for Jon Snow, and Henk informs her that Jon is a thousand miles away. They insist that she leave, but to their annoyance she asks who is in charge of the castle, and they inform her that it is Sansa Stark. Henk gives her a final warning and grabs for her, but she easily avoids him. Arya warns them what will happen if Sansa finds out that they turned her sister away and they agree to let her in. They argue over which of them will watch Arya and which of them will report to Sansa, and while they are distracted Arya disappears. They both reported to Sansa and told her who Arya had been asking for, with Henk insisting that she not not concern herself with the matter as she was probably an imposter from the winter town. Henk promises they will find her, though Sansa replies that they will not have to, as she knows where Arya has gone.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Koner</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkKoner</string></dict>

            Karlon was a younger son of the King in the North who was awarded lands on the eastern region of the North after putting down a rebellion of House Bolton of the Dreadfort.
            Over time, Karlon's seat, known as Karl's Hold, became known as Karhold, and his descendants became known as the Karstarks.[1][2][3][4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Karlon Stark's story is the same, except that the books do not specify to which vassal house the rebel lord belonged.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Karlon_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkKarlonStark</string></dict>
        <key>Jory Cassel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.22.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jory Cassel was the captain of the guards to House Stark. He was killed by Jaime Lannister while defending Lord Eddard Stark in King's Landing.
            Jory Cassel was the captain of Lord Eddard Stark's household guards at Winterfell. He is a loyal and trusted servant of House Stark and a good swordsman in his own right. He is the nephew of Ser Rodrik Cassel, Winterfell's Master-at-Arms. He has a noticeable scar, gained at the siege of Pyke during the Greyjoy Rebellion.
            Jory Cassel fought at the siege of Pyke alongside Jaime Lannister and Thoros of Myr who charged at the Greyjoy's with his burning sword. The same event was also the reason for his scar, as a Greyjoy soldier almost took his eye.
            Jory Cassel joins Lord Stark and his retinue as they venture out to execute Will. He is with the group when they find the direwolf pups.[1]
            Jory accompanies Eddard south to King's Landing. During the dispute between Prince Joffrey Baratheon and Arya Stark, Jory reports that Arya has been found and taken before the king. Jory accompanies Eddard to the Crossroads Inn and listens as King Robert questions those involved. Queen Cersei convinces him to sentence Sansa's direwolf Lady to death despite her not being involved because Arya's wolf Nymeria cannot be found. Eddard asks Jory to look after Arya and Sansa while he attends to the execution.[2]
            Jory assists Eddard's investigation into Jon Arryn's final days, unsuccessfully asking for the assistance of Ser Hugh of the Vale , accompanying Eddard to Tobho Mott's smithy and later reminiscing over fighting in the Greyjoy Rebellion with Ser Jaime Lannister.[3][4]
            Jory accompanies Eddard to Petyr Baelish's brothel, still seeking illegitimate royal children. Jory is distracted by one of the whores while Eddard questions Mhaegen. On leaving, Lord Eddard has to break Jory's attention away from the woman he is staring at so they can leave. As they walk outside accompanied by two Stark guards, Heward and Wyl, they are confronted by Jaime Lannister. Jaime has heard of his brother Tyrion's arrest and demands his release. Lord Eddard says it was done by his orders and if Jaime kills him Tyrion will die. Jaime has brought many Lannister men-at-arms. Jory begins to let Jaime know that if he is to threaten Eddard again, there would certainly be a fight. However, Jamie interrupts Jory, and he orders his men-at-arms to leave Eddard Stark alive, but to kill his men. They easily kill Heward and Wyl with thrown spears. Jory attacks and kills two of Jaime's men before engaging Jaime himself. Jaime and Jory trap swords and Jaime stabs Jory through the left eye with a dirk during this event. Eddard, angered and stunned by Jory's death, exchanges blows with Jaime before a Lannister guardsman stabs him through the knee, ending the melee.[5]
            When news about Jory and the others reaches Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy insists that Robb must make the Lannisters pay for their deaths, but Robb is hesitant about going to war.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jory is the son of Martyn Cassel, one of Eddard's companions who was killed in a duel with three members of the Kingsguard at the Tower of Joy while they were searching for Lyanna during the closing days of Robert's Rebellion. Jory is a skilled warrior and a stalwart servant of the house.
            Jory's role in the series is somewhat expanded from the books. Dialogue from several different Stark guardsmen is given to Jory (most notably his promise to Arya that he will keep Eddard safe, which in the book was given by a guardsman named Desmond) and the scenes where he talks to Ser Hugh and later Jaime Lannister are inventions of the TV series. In the book he is not killed personally by Jaime, but by the Lannister guardsmen that ultimately overwhelmed the small Stark contingent.
            According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, "Cassel" is pronounced "Cuss-EL", not "Kas-el" (that is, "Cassel" doesn't rhyme with "castle").</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jory_Cassel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkJoryCassel</string></dict>

            Varly accompanies Eddard Stark south when he becomes the Hand of the King. He warns the Royal Steward to stay back when he surprises them in the corridor. He accompanies Eddard to the throne room to confront Joffrey Baratheon. He is killed by men of the City Watch when they betray Eddard.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Varly is a guardsman sworn to House Stark.

            Vayon Poole serves House Stark as the Steward of Winterfell. He is the father of five daughters, one of whom, Jeyne Poole, is Sansa Stark's friend.[1]
            When Maester Luwin approaches Catelyn Stark to talk about the costs of the royal visit to Winterfell and the need to replace the members of the household that accompanied Lord Eddard to King's Landing, she, grieving for Bran, tells Luwin to have Poole see to the task. Luwin notes that Poole also went south with Lord Stark.[2]
            Poole is later killed by Lannister men during the purge of the Stark household ordered by King Joffrey after Lord Stark tries to remove him from the throne. He dies while he and his men are packing for an evacuation Ned had ordered in anticipation of his move against Joffrey.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, no mention is made of any children Vayon Poole may have had besides Jeyne though it is not implicit that Jeyne was his only child.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Vayon_Poole</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkVayonPoole</string></dict>
        <key>Bran Stark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.25.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brandon Stark, commonly called Bran, is the fourth child and second son of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. Bran is a warg and currently the new Three-Eyed Raven, using his supernatural gifts to assist his family in the war against the White Walkers.
            Bran is the fourth child and second son of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Eddard is the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell and Eddard also holds the title Lord of Winterfell. He is also the Warden of the North to King Robert Baratheon.[2]
            Bran was born and raised at Winterfell. He has an older brother Robb, and a younger brother Rickon. He has two older sisters, Sansa and Arya. He also has an older "bastard half-brother", Jon Snow; he is actually Bran's first cousin by his aunt Lyanna Stark. He was named for Eddard's elder brother, Brandon, who was brutally executed by the Mad King along with Bran's paternal grandfather Rickard Stark. He is only called "Brandon" by his mother when he has done something wrong. He dreams of being a knight of the Kingsguard, and his favorite hobby is climbing the walls of Winterfell and using its old rooftops and passageways to get around.[3]
            Bran is being trained by his father, brothers and the castle's staff in leadership and combat. Bran is considered old enough to see some of the uglier sides of life, and his father takes him to see a deserter from the Night's Watch being executed. The Starks find a litter of direwolf pups and Eddard reluctantly agrees to let his children adopt them because they are the symbol of their house. Bran eventually settles on naming his direwolf Summer. King Robert Baratheon's party arrives at Winterfell, and Eddard agrees to act as the Hand of the King and accompany Robert back to King's Landing, and to take Bran, Sansa and Arya with him.[4]
            During Robert's visit, Bran goes exploring. While climbing a decrepit tower, he catches the king's wife, Queen Cersei, and her twin brother, Jaime, engaged in sexual intercourse. To keep his silence, Jaime pushes him out of the tower window.[4] Bran survives the fall, but is left comatose, forcing Eddard to leave him in Winterfell. While he is unconscious an assassin attempts to kill him. Catelyn struggles with the man until Summer arrives and rips out the would-be assassin's throat. Summer then stands guard at the end of Bran's bed. Bran awakens with no memory of what happened some weeks later, at the same moment as his father is forced to kill Sansa's direwolf, Lady.[5]
            After Catelyn leaves for King's Landing, Old Nan sits by Bran’s bedside to watch him. She offers to tell him the story of Duncan the Tall and Bran replies that he hates her stories —he prefers the scary ones. She retorts that he is a "sweet summer child" who knows nothing about fear, and tells him that fear is for the winter and for the Long Night, a winter season thousands of years ago that lasted a generation, in which those who didn't freeze to death had to face the White Walkers, who ventured south for the first time and swept through Westeros. They are interrupted by Robb, and Bran asks him if it is true he will never walk again. Sadly, Robb says yes. Bran says that he would rather be dead, to Robb's distress.[6] Bran begins to have a recurring dream in which a three-eyed raven flies into the crypts of Winterfell. He is awoken to meet with Tyrion Lannister, who has stopped at Winterfell on his way home. Out of his regard for Jon Snow, Tyrion has designed a special saddle that will allow Bran to ride despite his injuries.[7] Bran takes a lesson on the sigils and mottos of the Great Houses from Maester Luwin, who is confident that Tyrion's saddle will work. Luwin also suggests that Bran could learn to use a shortbow from horseback, in the manner of the Dothraki. Bran bitterly refutes Luwin's assertion that his mother will return home soon.[8]
            Bran tries out his new saddle on a ride in the godswood and is thrilled to find that it works. While riding, he is attacked by wildlings led by Stiv. Robb and Theon Greyjoy defend Bran, killing Stiv and the other wildlings apart from Osha, who surrenders.[9] Robert dies after being injured while hunting.[10] Eddard challenges the legitimacy of Robert's heir, Joffrey, with evidence of Cersei's infidelity and is arrested. Bran says farewell to Robb when he leads the Stark armies to war in response. He also tries unsuccessfully to reassure Rickon that Robb will return. He prays in the godswood for their safe return, and is joined by Osha (now a servant of Winterfell), who tells him that Robb's army is marching the wrong way and the true threat lies to the north, Beyond the Wall.[11]
            Bran tells Osha of his dreams featuring the Three-Eyed Raven as he rides on her shoulders, saying that he saw his father in the crypts. Osha is skeptical. Bran taunts her about her fear of the catacombs and eventually she agrees to take him down to the crypt. Bran recites the names of his deceased relatives as they pass them. They approach the place where Eddard was in Bran’s dream. There, they are startled by Shaggydog and Rickon. Rickon has also dreamt of their father in that spot. Osha and Bran go back to the surface and Osha attempts to soothe Bran’s worries about his father. As they exit the crypts, they cross paths with Maester Luwin who reveals that Eddard has been executed for treason.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bran_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkBranStark</string></dict>

            According to legend, he allied with King-Beyond-the-Wall Joramun to defeat the Night's King and the Night's Queen, freeing the Night's Watch from their rule.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, his story is the same. After defeating the Night's King, he obliterated his name from memory. In some versions of the tale, he is the brother of the Night's King, also named Brandon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Brandon_Stark_(the_Breaker)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkBrandonStark</string></dict>
        <key>Benjen Stark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.27.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Benjen Stark was the First Ranger of the Night's Watch. He embarks on a ranging north of the Wall, and did not return. He was finally encountered again when he rescued Bran Stark and Meera Reed from wights after they escaped from the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven. Afterwards he led Bran and Meera close to the Wall but stayed behind because he could not pass through it due to his undead status. He eventually sacrificed himself to save his nephew Jon Snow by luring the army of the dead towards him.
            Benjen Stark is the youngest son of Lord Rickard Stark. Rickard was the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rule the region from their seat of Winterfell and Rickard also held the title Lord of Winterfell.[1]
            Benjen is the younger brother of Brandon, Eddard and Lyanna. Rickard, Brandon and Lyanna were all killed in the civil war known as Robert's Rebellion. Eddard inherited his father's titles and responsibilities.[2][3][4]
            He later attended the The Great Tourney at Harrenhal with his siblings.
            Benjen joined the Night's Watch, the military force which patrols the Wall and guards the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms. He earned the rank of First Ranger. Benjen is a hero to Eddard's "bastard son" Jon Snow.[5]
            Benjen travels south from the Wall to join in the feast welcoming King Robert Baratheon to Winterfell. He brings news about ill omens from beyond the Wall. Benjen tells Eddard that the young deserter he executed was a good and loyal man, a true ranger who would not desert his post lightly. He invites his nephew Jon Snow to join the Night's Watch; Jon agrees despite Benjen's warning that it is a hard life.[6] Eddard agrees to become the Hand of the King. A few days later, the royal party heads south. Benjen accompanies them to the Kingsroad and then escorts Jon and Tyrion Lannister north to Castle Black. Along the way they are joined by fresh recruits, including a rapist named Rast. Jon begins to realize that the Watch may not be the noble institution he thought it was.[7]
            Upon arriving at Castle Black Jon begins his training. Benjen tells Jon that he is going north of the Wall on a ranging. Jon asks to go with him, but Benjen tells him that he is not ready and cautions that on the Wall a man only gets what he earns, not what his birth entitles him to.
            Benjen says farewell to his friend Yoren, a recruiter for the Watch. He also exchanges words with Tyrion, who is about to head south with Yoren. Benjen feels that Tyrion holds the Watch in disregard despite Tyrion's protests to the contrary.[8]
            Catelyn Stark takes Tyrion prisoner at the Crossroads Inn believing he attempted to kill her son, Bran.[9] Because of his friendship with Benjen, Yoren rides on to King's Landing and reports Catelyn's actions to Eddard.[10]
            Benjen's horse returns to Castle Black, but there is no sign of Benjen himself.[11] Shortly afterwards, two of the rangers who accompanied Benjen, Othor and Jafer Flowers, are found dead in the forest beyond the Wall. They are brought back to Castle Black for Maester Aemon to study, but in the middle of the night they reanimate as wights. Both are killed again and their bodies are burned.[12] Lord Commander Jeor Mormont vows to take the Watch beyond the Wall in force to investigate what's going on and promises Jon that they will find Benjen alive or dead.[13]
            As the travel beyond the Wall in search, Mormont and his men stop at Craster's Keep where Mormont tells the wildling Craster that Benjen has said he planned to stop there on his way to the Frostfangs. Craster gruffly replies that he hasn't seen Benjen for three years and hasn't missed him, saying that Benjen "always treated me like scum."[14]
            Jon, who has now been elected the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, ends up alienating many of his fellow black brothers when he brings back several thousand Wildlings that were driven away from Hardhome and allows them safe passage through Castle Black. His personal steward, Olly, lures him into a trap by claiming one of the Wildlings that he brought back says he knows Benjen. As Jon walks outside to see if this is true, Alliser Thorne (who Jon has since named First Ranger in place of the missing Benjen) adds that this Wildling claims he saw Benjen at Hardhome on the last full moon. However, this is revealed to be nothing but a ruse as Alliser, Olly, and four other black brothers proceed to fatally stab Jon.[15]
            Benjen appears in a vision experienced by Bran Stark. Benjen is shown training with Ned under a young Rodrik Cassel in the courtyard of Winterfell, though his skills are far inferior to Ned's. Lyanna appears and playfully teases Benjen about not having a sparring partner after Ned goes to the Eyrie, and suggests that Hodor, then known as Wylis, take up swordplay. Benjen almost has a match with Hodor, who is led away by Old Nan.
            Benjen is seen later in another of Bran's visions saying goodbye to Ned shortly before the latter heads off to the Vale.[16] In another, he witnesses Hodor's seizure that renders him unable to speak properly other than the word "Hodor", but he is held back by Rodrik.[17]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Benjen_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTMascStarkBenjenStark</string></dict>
