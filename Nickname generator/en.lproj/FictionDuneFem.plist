Dortujla comes to Odrade at Chapterhouse, reporting that Handlers and their half-man/half-cat enslaved Futars have offered alliance against the Honored Matres, who have yet to make a move on Buzzell. Dortujla's Mentat analysis, however, suggests that the Handlers somehow intend dominance, and that the Matres intend to colonize Buzzell. Odrade sees an opportunity; she orders Dortujla to return to Buzzell and make contact with the Matres, brokering a meeting between Odrade and the Honored Matre leader (in which the Bene Gesserit will supposedly surrender) on Junction — the old Spacing Guild complex above Gammu — which the Matres control. Dortujla is tortured by the Honored Matres and forced to watch her party be murdered and fed to captive Futars; however, she witnesses a Futar using its immobilizing scream (which has "qualities of Voice") against the Matres. Later, Dortujla accompanies Odrade, Tamalane and the acolyte Suipol to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction, as Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu.

            Feyd-Rautha dipped his head with the required courtesy. He stared at the Lady Fenring.

            Mohiam is portrayed by Siân Phillips in David Lynch's 1984 film Dune, and by Zuzana Geislerová in the 2000 miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel Frank Herbert's Children of Dune.
            In the novel Dune, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen has this impression of Mohiam:
            An old woman in a black aba robe with hood drawn down over her forehead detached herself from the Emperor's suite, took up station behind the throne, one scrawny hand resting on the quartz back. Her face peered out of the hood like a witch caricature — sunken cheeks and eyes, an overlong nose, skin mottled and with protruding veins.
            The Baron stilled his trembling at sight of her. The presence of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, the Emperor's Truthsayer, betrayed the importance of this audience.[3]
            In Dune Messiah, Herbert notes that Mohiam's eyes are "dark with the blue brilliance of her melange addiction."[4]
            The non-canon Dune Encyclopedia (1984) by Willis E.

They are obligated to turn her over to the Honored Matres for their own survival, but before they do, Lucilla shares minds with Rebecca, transferring the knowledge of the "Lampadas horde." Rebecca and the Jews eventually escape Gammu with the Bene Gesserit forces, and Rebecca is able to pass on the 7,622,014 Lampadas shared-minds to the Sisterhood.[4]
            In Hunters of Dune (2006), Rebecca is on the no-ship Ithaca when Sheeana and Duncan Idaho use it to make their escape from Chapterhouse. Rebecca later offers herself as a volunteer to become one of the axlotl tanks used to produce the important gholas of Paul Atreides, Leto II and others.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string></string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneFemRebecca</string></dict>

In Hunters of Dune (2006), Rinya and Janess are prodigies: ambitious, impatient, and unquestionably talented, but Janess possesses just a hint more caution. Janess is obsessed with learning more about her father Duncan, and she often quotes his philosophical works. Rinya always has to be first for everything, and she demands to be allowed to undergo the spice agony, wanting to become a Reverend Mother at the age of 14, just like Sheeana had done. Janess tries to stop the ritual but Rinya insists; Rinya fails and dies.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string></string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneFemRinya</string></dict>

As the leader of a faction of the Sisterhood who believe that such gholas are a danger to the order and its goals, she has been subtly encouraging the ghola's failure. By the time Lucilla arrives to teach Idaho and bind his loyalty to the Sisterhood with sexual imprinting, he has already been tarnished by Schwangyu and nurses hate for the Bene Gesserit, hoping to escape their control of his life. Despite Schwangyu's efforts to seduce Lucilla to her side, Idaho blossoms under the training of Lucilla (and Miles Teg), and Schwangyu begins to realize that she has much underestimated Lucilla.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string></string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneFemSchwangyu</string></dict>
        <key>Sheeana</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.01.1.34</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sheeana Brugh is a young girl native to the planet Rakis whose unique ability to control sandworms is revealed after her impoverished village is wiped out by one in Heretics of Dune (1984). The giant creature refuses to harm her, then whisks her to the capital city of Keen when she climbs on to its back in the long-forbidden Fremen tradition. Sheeana is soon recognized as the "sandrider" predicted by the God Emperor Leto II, and worshipped by the priesthood of Rakis. As she matures to adulthood, Sheeana effectively assumes control of the priesthood; her popularity and religious aura have increased both on and off Rakis, and the priests, believing her a prophet, are compelled to follow even her most unorthodox commands. The Bene Gesserit — who have their own plans for Sheeana and have secretly guided her education — thwart an assassination attempt on her, and unofficially take control of Sheeana, the priesthood, and Rakis. Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade begins Sheeana's formal Bene Gesserit training, and Mother Superior Taraza is soon pleased with Sheeana's progress, and considers a secondary plan of seeding other planets with sandworms with Sheeana's help.[5]
            Rakis itself is destroyed by the Honored Matres at the end of Heretics of Dune; in Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), Sheeana is now in charge of the project to breed sandworms on the Bene Gesserit world Chapterhouse. She becomes a full Reverend Mother but remains very independent, with mysterious depths. Disagreeing with the plans of new Bene Gesserit leader Murbella, at the end of Chapterhouse Dune Sheeana chooses to escape Chapterhouse on a no-ship with the Duncan Idaho ghola.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string></string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneFemSheeana</string></dict>

Odrade describes her as a "dark little thing with a round, calm face and manners to match. Not one of our brightest but guaranteed efficient." However, after interaction with Suipol, Odrade realizes that she is much more capable than anticipated and judges her ready to undertake the spice agony and become a full Reverend Mother. Suipol and her party are eventually slain by the Honored Matres, but the Bene Gesserit conquest proves successful with Murbella left as leader to both the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres. Odrade is upset by the Suipol's death, lamenting the fact that the young acolyte died without being able to share her memories with another sister.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string></string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneFemSuipol</string></dict>

Syaksa and four other Reverend Mothers (Yitob, Mamulut, Eknekosk and Akeli) incorporate information gleaned from this mission into an "assessment of the state of the Empire" for that year (before the subsequent assassination of Leto II). Syaksa believes that the religious character of the Fish Speakers is slowly being devolved under Leto II. She further attributes to him a motive based on the concept of hydraulic despotism, in which a government structure maintains power and control through exclusive control over a basic resource needed to live (in this case, melange), proposing that he is building the Empire toward an even greater dependence on the spice.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string></string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneFemSyaksa</string></dict>

Taraza blackmails Tleilaxu Master Waff to find out all he knows about the new threat to the Old Empire known as the Honored Matres, as well as the fact that the Bene Tleilax have included their own agenda within the ghola. She also manages to divine that Waff is a secret Zensufi, which finally gives the Sisterhood a way to manipulate the Tleilaxu. Assigned to take command of the outpost on Rakis by Taraza, Odrade makes an alliance with Waff using this very knowledge of his religious beliefs. This alliance plays into Taraza's master plan: to destroy Rakis and free humanity from Leto II's own plan. An alliance with the Tleilaxu, the only remaining source of melange, would be essential after such a scenario. Taraza then considers a secondary plan of seeding other planets with sandworms with the help of the "sandrider" — a girl named Sheeana who has the power to control the worms. But when the Honored Matres finally attack Rakis, Taraza is killed with the first attack, cut down by lasguns. Luckily, Odrade has time to share Other Memory with Taraza before escaping with Sheeana into the desert on a worm.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string></string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneFemTaraza</string></dict>

Yueh gives in to the Baron's demands, but twists the letter of his orders and tries to kill Harkonnen with the unwitting help of Duke Leto, an attempt that ultimately fails.
