Since Cracktooth was submissive, Tolruck used her as his personal servant and gardener. She and her fellow Wookiees on the planet Kashyyyk were fitted with inhibitor chips which kept them in line. After Sinjir Rath Velus deactivated the inhibitor chips' control module during the liberation of Kashyyyk, Cracktooth exacted revenge on her former master Tolruck and broke his neck.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Subject_6391-A</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieFemSubject6391A</string></dict>
    <key>Mallatobuck</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.2.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mallatobuck, also known as Malla, was the wife of Chewbacca, the Wookiee co-pilot of the Corellian smuggler Han Solo. During the Imperial Era, Malla and her family were enslaved by the Galactic Empire. She was separated from her husband Chewbacca and her son Lumpawaroo. Following the Liberation of Kashyyyk, she was reunited with her family.
        Malla was the wife of Chewbacca and the mother of Lumpawaroo. During the Imperial Era, Malla and her family were enslaved by the Empire. She and her son were put in an Imperial slave camp on Kashyyyk.[3] At some point, Malla was separated from her son Lumpawaroo, who became a child slave in Commandant Dessard's camp on the slopes of Mount Arayakyak.[4] Her husband Chewbacca ended up as a slave on the planet Mimban until he was rescued by Han Solo, a renegade Imperial Mud trooper.[5]
        During the Galactic Civil War that pitted the Galactic Empire against the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Chewbacca was traveling with Solo, away from Malla[2] and the rest of his family on Kashyyyk.[6] Following the liberation of Kashyyyk from the Empire's grasp, Chewbacca finally reunited with his wife and son.[3]
        Malla was a female[2] Wookiee[1] who was married to Chewbacca[2] and the mother of Lumpawaroo.[3] According to Solo, she was intelligent and had hair resembling silk.[2]
        Mallatobuck was first mentioned in Star Wars canon in the 2015 young readers novel A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy, a retelling of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope written by Alexandra Bracken.[2] Malla was created for The Star Wars Holiday Special, a Star Wars Legends TV movie released in 1978.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mallatobuck</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieFemMallatobuck</string></dict>
    <key>Lohgarra</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.3.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lohgarra was a female Wookiee who was captain of the cargo transport known as the Mighty Oak Apocalypse (Moa for short). Lohgarra transported only legal cargo, but she operated on the fringes, where Imperial oversight was rarely an issue. Seven months after the Battle of Yavin, Logharra hired Thane Kyrell as a copilot and navigator. Some time after Thane had joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Logharra decided to assist the Rebellion as well. The Mighty Oak Apocalypse joined the Alliance Fleet and docked aboard the Liberty before the Battle of Endor. After the destruction of the second Death Star, Lohgarra was seen celebrating the victory over Imperial forces on the forest moon of Endor. After the Battle of Endor, she used credits that were given out by the newly formed New Republic to species affected by war crimes to upgrade her ship.
        Lohgarra was known to have spent two centuries serving as a ship captain who owned a freighter called the Mighty Oak Apocalypse (or Moa for short). By the time of the reign of the Galactic Empire, she was one of the few Wookiees to have escaped the enslavement of her homeworld of Kashyyyk at the hands of the Empire. She recalled that Kashyyyk had once been a paradise but that the Empire had turned the planet into a "hell." Her crew members included a purple and black JJH2 model astromech droid JJH2, the Tarsunt engineer Brill, and the Ithorian maintenance officer Methwat Tann. Lohgarra and her crew spend much of their transporting legal cargo through the Outer Rim Territories and the Expansion Region.[1]
        Seven months after the Battle of Yavin, the former TIE fighter pilot Thane Kyrell found work as a copilot and navigator. Thane had left the Empire after witnessing the Empire's destruction of Alderaan and the maltreatment of Bodach'i slaves on Kerev Doi. While Kyrell never told Lohgarra that he was an Imperial deserter, she realized who he was but did not hold it against Thane. For several months, Thane worked for Lohgarra. After Thane found that they could not recharge the ship's power cell, she allowed him to buy a new power cell on Zeitooine but warned him that the planet was not known as a cheap place. While visiting Zeitooine, Thane witnessed the Empire arrest of a local family and forgot to buy the power cell.[1]
        Eighteen months after the events on Yavin, Lohgarra and her crew delivered medical supplies to the planet Oulanne, which had been struck by a massive earthquake. As they entered the planet's atmosphere, Thane reported that they were approaching a megahurricane covering a good quarter of the land area. Despite the rough conditions and the Moa being heavily laden with cargo, Thane managed to convince Lohgarra to let him land the ship. Against the odds, Thane managed to land the Moa. Lohgarra congratulated Thane for his efforts and hugged him tightly. As a sign of praise and affection, she also started grooming him.[1]
        While on Oulanne, Thane met the Rebel Alliance pilot Wedge Antilles, who convinced him to join the Rebel Alliance. After some discussion, Thane managed to convince Lohgarra to let him leave and join the rebel group. While Lohgarra was initially hesitant to lose her copilot and navigator, she relented after recalling that her own people had been enslaved by the Empire and that Kashyyyk, so beautiful in her youth, had been turned into a literal hell. When Thane told her about his lover Ciena Ree who was still in the Imperial Navy, Lohgarra remarked that the Force had a way of bringing people together when the time was right. Thane then took it that Lohgarra was happy for him to join the Rebellion.[1]
        Shortly before the dogfight in the Hudalla system, Lohgarra and her crew decided to join the Rebel Alliance. She landed the Moa on the planet 5251977. While Lohgarra hugged Thane, Brill informed the rebel pilot that they had refitted the Moa with new shields, dampeners, and guns. Prior to the Battle of Endor, Lohgarra and her crew met with Thane at the hangar of the MC80A star cruiser Home One. She also lent her astromech droid to the rebel pilot Yendor, who was a member of Thane's Corona Squadron. Lohgarra and her crew took part in the Battle of Endor, which saw the deaths of Emperor Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, and afterwards joined the mass celebration in Bright Tree Village, where she was observed to be "outdrinking an entire squadron".[1]
        Following the establishment of the New Republic, Lohgarra received reparations from the new government as part of a program to compensate species enslaved by the Empire. Lohgarra used these funds to buy new engines for the Mighty Oak Apocalypse.[1]
        Lohgarra was an elderly female Wookiee with white fur. Her eyes were once dark blue but had gone slightly milky white by the time of the Battle of Endor. As a Wookiee, Lohgarra spoke only Shyriiwook. Despite her old age, Lohgarra's vision and mind remained sharp. Unlike most freighter pilots and owners, her shipping jobs were never motivated by a quest for riches but by her character; a lucrative run of luxury goods could be followed by a zero-sum haul of emergency generators to a troubled outpost or medical supplies to a devastated region. Lohgarra viewed her ship and crew more like a home and family, refusing to make big decisions without first consulting them and receiving their support or dissent. She hired crew that she could trust and was known to be maternal towards crew members that she took under her wing including Thane Kyrell, indeed treating him with more affection than his own mother.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lohgarra</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieFemLohgarra</string></dict>
    <key>Dewlannamapia</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.4.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dewlannamapia, also known by the shortened name Dewlanna, was a female Wookiee who, at an old age, followed her mate Isshaddik in his exile from their homeworld of Kashyyyk. The two joined the crew of Trader's Luck, a starship captained by a Human named Garris Shrike and crewed with children who worked for him as thieves. Even after her mate was killed during a smuggling run, Dewlannamapia remained aboard Trader's Luck, working as a cook. During her days aboard the ship, she met a nine-year-old Corellian boy called Han. Dewlannamapia deeply cared for Han and essentially became a surrogate mother for him. She was responsible for discovering Han's last name, Solo, which Shrike had kept secret. Dewlannamapia oversaw Solo's education, and at one point she even saved him when he nearly died from Corellian Tanamen Fever.
        In 10 BBY, hoping to flee from the violent and abusive Shrike, Solo planned an escape from Trader's Luck. When he came to the galley to say goodbye to Dewlannamapia, the two were found by Shrike. A brawl ensued, and Dewlannamapia sacrificed her life to protect Solo from a blaster shot fired by Shrike. The young Corellian successfully escaped from Trader's Luck and became a pilot in the Imperial Navy. Believing that he was forever indebted to Dewlannamapia, Solo later saved a Wookiee named Chewbacca from being killed by the Imperial Commander Pter Nyklas. Solo was expelled from the Navy, and he and Chewbacca became smuggling partners. Dewlannamapia was also survived by several cubs; one of them, Utchakkaloch, met Solo at one point and accepted the Corellian as his adoptive brother.
        Dewlannamapia—"Dewlanna" for short—was a female Wookiee born around 610 BBY.[2] She was the mate of Isshaddik and the mother of several cubs, among them Utchakkaloch.[1] Around 20 BBY,[4] Isshaddik was exiled from the family's homeworld of Kashyyyk for a crime he had committed; Dewlannamapia followed her mate into exile, leaving behind her home and her grown cubs. The two of them joined the ragtag criminal crew of the starship Trader's Luck, captained by a Human named Garris Shrike. Only a year later, however, Isshaddik was killed during a smuggling run to the planet Nar Hekka in Hutt Space. Shrike, who was rather fond of Dewlannamapia's cooking, offered her a chance to stay aboard Trader's Luck. Although Dewlannamapia was free to return to Kashyyyk, she chose to accept the proposition and thus became the ship's cook. Aboard the craft, Dewlannamapia stayed in personal quarters near the galley. She befriended a nine-year-old Corellian boy named Han, one of the many children Shrike employed as thieves and pickpockets.[1]
        Dewlannamapia taught Han to speak and understand the Wookiee language of Shyriiwook.[5] However, it was difficult for Han to reproduce the growls of which Shyriiwook consisted, so he preferred to speak Galactic Basic Standard. As Dewlannamapia understood Basic as well as her own language, the communication between her and Han was fluent. Shrike did not provide his children with education beyond that which was needed in their criminal activities, such as reading and simple math; however, Han's natural desire to defy Shrike led him to pursue further schooling clandestinely. When Dewlannamapia became aware of this, she encouraged Han to study. The young Corellian had a tendency to learn only subjects that he enjoyed and considered useful, like mathematics, and to largely ignore subjects he did not like, particularly history. Dewlannamapia made certain to monitor Han's curriculum, forcing him to learn disciplines that he otherwise would have skipped, and the boy eventually began to like history once he realized that some historical battles were as interesting as the ones he had read about in adventure books.[1] Dewlannamapia also taught Han to prepare meals, and he became a fair cook himself. She kept in contact with her son Utchakkaloch, telling him anecdotes about the young Han who loved her wastril bread, and who craved to become a pilot.[6]
        One day, an unconscious Han was brought aboard Trader's Luck, having fallen sick with high fever after a mission he had performed for Shrike on the planet Corellia, during which Han had stolen some valuable jewelry. Dewlannamapia tended to the boy, and, fearing for his life, insisted that Shrike take him to a medical droid on Corellia. Shrike was unwilling to spend money on Han's treatment, believing that the boy would recuperate soon. Deciding to take the matter into her own hands, Dewlannamapia commandeered a shuttle and took Han to a medical droid. Upon examining the Human, the droid concluded that Han had a severe case of Corellian Tanamen Fever, and that he could have died had Dewlannamapia not brought him to Corellia. The droid prescribed a course of bacta immersion therapy, for which Dewlannamapia paid from her own savings. After Han spent some time in a bacta tank and got better, the two returned to Trader's Luck. Shrike was furious at Dewlannamapia for disobeying his orders, but the Wookiee stood her ground and insisted that she had done the right thing. Shrike eventually calmed down when he realized that one of the pieces of jewelry that Han had stolen the night he had fallen ill was a set with a genuine Krayt dragon pearl that was worth a fortune. Still, Shrike never repaid Dewlannamapia for Han's medical bills.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dewlannamapia</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieFemDewlannamapia</string></dict>

During the occupation of Kashyyyk by the Galactic Empire following the war, Warrchallra lived in exile and became a freedom fighter as part of the Wookiee underground. Prior to the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Warrchallra provided the concept for the propaganda poster "Liberty for All" to the Clawdite illustrator Tavris Bahzel while the shapeshifter was disguised as a Twi'lek, who toned down the graphic violence it depicted.[1] By the year 34 ABY,[2] Warrchallra was focused on creating art that celebrated the Wookiee people.[1]
        Warrchallra was first mentioned in the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Warrchallra</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieFemWarrchallra</string></dict>
