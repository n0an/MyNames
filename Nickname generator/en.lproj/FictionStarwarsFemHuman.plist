        <key>DT-F16</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.1.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>DT-F16 was a human female death trooper commander who, along with her squad, were tasked with guarding a large kyber crystal from the Jedha system for delivery to the Tonnis sector in Freighter 2716 to rendezvous with an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer helmed by Captain Slavin. At a brief stop at Faos Station, the freighter was infiltrated by the rebels Saw Gerrera, Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren and Chopper. DT-F16 attempted to combat the rebels, but was killed when Saw rigged the kyber crystal up to the freighter's hyperdrive, creating a bomb, and Ezra, Sabine, Chopper and the freighter's prisoners escaped in a Lambda-class shuttle intended for the commander.
            In 1 BBY,[source?] DT-F16 and her squad were traveling on Freighter 2716, a covert Imperial ship disguised as a civilian vessel, guarding a large kyber crystal that was being delivered to a rendezvous in the Tonnis sector. Unbeknowest to most of the freighter's crew, it was infiltrated by the rebels Saw Gerrera, Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren and Chopper during a stop at Faos Station. When the rebels discovered the hold with the kyber crystal, she encountered the rebels, and ordered her troopers to open fire. As the troopers quickly fell to the rebels in the smoke generated by several smoke bombs tossed by Wren, DT-F16 ordered the remaining troopers to group up. During the skirmish, one of Gerrera's blaster shots struck the carbon-frozen crystal, prompting her to order a retreat; however, she would be the only one to escape, as her remaining troopers were blasted by Gerrera and Wren.[1]
            DT-F16 later informed the freighter's captain, Wells, that rebels led by Gerrera infiltrated the hold and requested reinforcements. The captain gave her reinforcements, warning her that she had to retake the crystal, something which she was aware of as their heads would be gone if the crystal was stolen. When reinforcements arrived (in the form of four stormtroopers), she returned to the hold, only to find both the rebels and the crystal gone. The captain informed her that they had lost contact with the engine room, so she made her way there.[1]
            Upon arriving, Gerrera, who had turned the crystal into a ticking time bomb, fled the area after freeing Bridger and Wren. DT-F16 and the stormtroopers prepared to fire, but before they could do so, the crystal electrocuted the two troopers in front of her. She realized that she had to leave immediately and ordered the remaining troopers to abandon ship. She made her way to hold 12, where a Lambda-class shuttle was waiting for her departure. By the time she got there, the freighter's prisoners, who had been freed by the rebels, were boarding. She and the two troopers accompanying her attempted to open fire, but Bridger and Wren, who had also arrived, managed to overpower her and the two troopers before getting on the shuttle and taking off. DT-F16 made a futile attempt to destroy the shuttle with her blaster, and was subsequently killed in the ensuing explosion.[1]
            DT-F16 was a female Death trooper who had a mechanical voice. She was completely covered in black armor and had a green-tinted visor. DT-F16 was determined to ensure the safe delivery of a large kyber crystal to Slavin's Star Destroyer and feared the consequences of failure. She wielded an E-11D blaster. As a commander, DT-F16 had leadership skills but failed to apprehend rebel boarders and stop them from destroying the kyber crystal and escaping with the prisoners.[1]
            DT-F16 first appeared in "In the Name of the Rebellion", a two-part episode of the fourth season of Star Wars Rebels. She was voiced by Jennifer Hale who voiced Aayla Secura, Riyo Chuchi and Lolo Purs in Star Wars: The Clone Wars.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/DT-F16</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDTF16</string></dict>
        <key>Aiolin Astarte</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.2.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aiolin Astarte was a female human engineered and trained by Doctor Cylo to replace the Sith Lord Darth Vader as Darth Sidious' Sith apprentice.
            Astarte and her twin brother Morit Astarte were born of the Astarte line of Celanon, who had joined the Separatist cause. The Astarte line funded much of Cylo's early work. Cylo thought of them as "generally smart" and "forward facing." Fearing retribution for their allegiance during the Clone Wars, the Astartes passed their children to Cylo for training and experimentation, in the hope of redeeming themselves.
            Aiolin was born, along with her brother, Morit, into the Astarte line of Celanon either before or during the Clone Wars. His family financially backed the research of Doctor Cylo, a specialist in cybernetics whose experiments were considered immoral and illegal by the Galactic Republic, during this time. The Astartes sided with the Separatists during the war and, fearing the retribution of the new Galactic Empire, gave their two children over to Cylo's care.[1][5]
            With backing from the newly self-appointed Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine, Cylo continued his research and included Aiolin and Morit into his experiments. He upgraded them with the best genetic enhancements and technolgy that made them stronger and capable of greater feats than common warriors. Such an ability was an ability to slice into technological systems and with little to no ability. Cylo believed that this not only made up for their lack of Force sensitivity, but also eliminated any need for the Force. He also provided the twins with advanced training in lightsaber combat. Coupled with their technological upgrades, including rockets placed in the soles of their feet and missile launchers in their wrists, this turned the Astarte twins into warriors with abilities equaling those of the Jedi and Sith of old.[1]
            Several weeks[6] after the Battle of Yavin, Sith Lord Darth Vader learned of her and her brother's existence after he captured and killed Cylo,[4] after learning of the doctor's existence from the Emperor, Darth Sidious.[7] She was sent along with her brother, Morit, to Sho-Torun to aid Darth Vader in subduing the the Ore-Baron revolt against Queen Trios at Sho-Torun. During the ensuing conflict at Sho-Torun, she gravitated towards Vader as a mentor, wishing he would teach her the ways of the Jedi. She hoped Vader would train her to become better at the lightsaber. Vader was quick to dismiss this, saying nothing he could teach would be useful to her, and telling her that she and her brother had bought a fantasy: Neither of them had any future.
            Nearing the end of the revolt at the Sho-Torun war, she and her brother Morit tried to ambush Vader, in order to take out one of their competitors in their scheme for who would be the Emperor's right hand. However, Vader successfully held them off, and Aiolin told her brother that she was no longer certain they could ever defeat Vader. Morit was however still determined to eliminate one of his competitors on that occasion, and in an act of sudden betrayal, he pushed Aiolin off a cliff, making her fall into a pit of molten lava.
            Before she succumbed to her agonizing wounds, Vader used the Force to raise her from the lava. In an uncharacteristic display of seeming compassion, he assured her that the pain would soon pass, but asked her to tell him everything she knew. The horribly burnt woman revealed that Cylo V had collaborated with the Ore-Barons in the rebellion against Queen Trios and was planning to betray the Emperor Palpatine. Aiolin then thanked Vader in advance for ending her pain, apparently understanding what this really entailed: Vader used his lightsaber to kill her and quickly put her out of her misery.
            Vader's somewhat merciful handling of the situation—even though he was dealing with a person who had just tried to kill him—was probably motivated by his own traumatic memory of being maimed and burnt on Mustafar.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aiolin_Astarte</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAiolinAstarte</string></dict>
        <key>Ysanne Isard</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.3.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ysanne Isard was a female Human who served as the Director of Imperial Intelligence for several years during the Galactic Civil War, and ruled the Galactic Empire herself for a time after the Emperor's death in 4 ABY. Isard followed her father, Armand Isard, into Imperial Intelligence at a young age, blossoming into a model field agent. After the Alliance to Restore the Republic stole coordinates of the location of the Death Star's construction site, Ysanne was sent on a mission to the planet Darkknell. While the mission was a failure, she survived but the prospect of losing considerable face back on Imperial Center infuriated Isard. She instead found a way to pin the blame on her father. Backed up by members of the Emperor's Royal Guards, she accused her father of treason; the Emperor had him executed within the hour, and she took her father's position as Director of Imperial Intelligence. Isard was exceptionally close to Palpatine, so much so that she was given the second Executor-class Star Dreadnought constructed, the Lusankya. Buried underneath the surface of her homeworld of Coruscant, the Lusankya became a prison and brainwashing facility, and Isard used it to torture the secrets out of many enemies of the Empire, as well as convert selected prisoners into sleeper agents.
            After the Battle of Endor, Isard became an advisor to Grand Vizier Sate Pestage, all the while engineering his downfall. In the same day, Isard had Pestage and the Imperial Ruling Council assassinated, leaving her Empress in all but name. Isard commanded a sizable force at the height of her power, though the fact she held Coruscant made her a target for the New Republic. Knowing Coruscant would inevitably fall to the New Republic, she had the Krytos virus developed, so that they would inherit a sick world and hopefully fragment. Isard would eventually make contact with Grand Admiral Thrawn, who, was within the Unknown Regions maintaining his shadow empire. After blasting off Coruscant in the Lusankya, Ysanne Isard supported a political coup of Thyferra, and became a warlord. Rogue Squadron followed her to Thyferra, though, and managed to defeat her forces and capture the planet. Isard was presumed dead.
            She had, in fact, survived, and remained in hiding during the Thrawn campaign, biding her time and contemplating past mistakes. Sometime during her time in hiding, she was contacted by the reborn Palpatine, and pledged to steal back her Lusankya and present it to him. When her clone allied herself with warlord Delak Krennel and reemerged in the Ciutric Hegemony, Isard provided Rogue Squadron with the location of the Lusankya prisoners, among them Rebel Alliance General Jan Dodonna, to discreetly obtain their aid in eliminating her clone. She betrayed the New Republic, though, and attempted to steal the Lusankya from New Republic control at the Bilbringi shipyards. However, a New Republic Intelligence agent, Iella Wessiri, was waiting for her and shot her dead.
            Ysanne Isard was born into a wealthy and influential family on the planet Coruscant[1] in approximately 30 BBY,[2] during the waning days of the Galactic Republic. Her father, Armand Isard, was the Director of the Senate Bureau of Intelligence, becoming the Director of Imperial Intelligence when the Republic was reformed into the first Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. The Isards flourished under Palpatine's rule, possessing far more power and prestige than during the time of the Republic.[4] Ysanne was born with heterochromia iridium,[6] possessing one red and one blue eye, though her features were said to be otherwise attractive.[1] She was raised on Coruscant[7] and grew up in the Emperor's Court;[1] as a young child, she idolized her father, boasting of his power to anyone that would listen. Armand Isard saw fit to allow his young daughter to accompany him to work, and had no qualms about her being in the presence of dangerous individuals like High Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne; others did, however, and often questioned the presence of a child in high-security areas. During the Great Jedi Purge, Ysanne went with her father to Imperial facilities on Coruscant often, though she displayed little awareness of his work: aiding Palpatine's Dark Jedi in hunting down Jedi fugitives.[6] She was also known to attend Imperial party receptions with her father, rarely leaving his side.[5]
            Any naïveté present in Ysanne Isard was gone by the time she reached adolescence, when the coldness and ambition she inherited from her father began to manifest itself. Armand began training his daughter from a very young age as a field operative, hoping for her to follow in his footsteps and gain a position in Imperial Intelligence. Ysanne was incredibly ambitious, and, after flourishing and growing into an expert field agent, she began to plot her ascension behind his back. She did not take advantage of her father's position,[4] using her own talents—augmented by her vigor and ruthlessness when dealing with enemies of the Empire—to rise above her peers. She built up a plethora of contacts and alliances within Imperial Intelligence, who were able to help her in acquiring information that her rank did not allow her; despite the most stringent of security procedures, she managed to find out about the Death Star project at least a year before it was officially announced. From a young age, Ysanne developed a close personal devotion to the Emperor,[5] and found his power and charisma attractive; she eventually came to love him.[7] By the time she was in her twenties, Isard had become one of the best field agents among Imperial Intelligence.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ysanne_Isard</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemYsanneIsard</string></dict>

        <key>Ice  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.5.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ice was a Human female competitor at the Taris dueling ring that operated at the Upper City Cantina during the Jedi Civil War. Inspired by the legendary Mandalorian duelist Bendak Starkiller, Ice was a competent gladiator who received her handle as a result of her cold disposition. To her, coldness was a theme that she adopted for every aspect of her persona: she was harsh and critical toward everyone, even her fans. Nevertheless, she was popular among audiences of the arena, being an intermediate-ranking duelist. Shortly before the destruction of Taris, she was challenged and defeated by the amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith Revan, who had joined the duel ring under the alias "Mysterious Stranger" and would subsequently surpass the other duelists and become the ring's last champion before its destruction.
            In her childhood, the Human female later known as Ice idolized the famed Bendak Starkiller, a legendary gladiator of the dueling ring run by Ajuur the Hutt, located in the Upper City Cantina on the planet Taris. In Starkiller, she found her inspiration, hoping to follow in his footsteps and pursue a career as a duelist. Upon meeting the gladiator for the first time, however, she found his personality revolting. So affected was the girl by this meeting that she resolved to emulate Starkiller's ruthless, anti-social character, embracing it as a lesson in the reality of the world.[1]
            As an adult, the woman stayed true to her dream and joined the Taris dueling ring,[1] having been personally chosen by Ajuur himself.[2] By 3956 BBY,[3] Ice had acquired a considerable following among fans of the sport, having earned a reputation as a devious fighter.[2] She was especially popular with the female demographic, as women admired that her prowess proved they could achieve in such a field, but she was dismissive of being an icon for gender equality. Of the competitors current to that year, Ice could defeat Gerlon Two-Fingers and Deadeye Duncan, the latter of whom was considered the worst duelist of all time. While respected for her skills, she was no match for the veteran duelist Marl or the then-champion Twitch and her ranking was therefore intermediate.[1]
            It was in that same year that a Sith fleet led by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Malak occupied Taris and imposed martial law alongside a planetary blockade. Under the quarantine, the dueling arena continued to operate as usual, with the Sith enforcing the ban on death matches that had led to Bendak's retirement.[1]
            However, one of the Republic soldiers who escaped the destruction of the Republic warship Endar Spire, the amnesiac former Dark Lord Revan, visited the Upper City Cantina and decided to join the dueling arena under the alias "Mysterious Stranger". After beating Deadeye Duncan and Gerlon Two-Fingers, he fought Ice and emerged victorious, winning 300 credits. With her defeat, Ice was quick to conclude that Revan's martial prowess far eclipsed her own, accepting this as another simple, cold, hard truth. Sure enough, she would watch as Revan went on to defeat Marl and Twitch as well, becoming the last champion of the duel ring before the destruction of Taris at the hands of the Sith.[1]
            As her stage name suggested, Ice exhibited a cold, dispassionate personality, generally unwilling to befriend others. Though she was deeply cynical, she was not always so, as in her childhood, she dreamed often of meeting her idol Bendak Starkiller. When this dream at last came true, she was struck by his toxic personality. Whether she felt more heartbroken or impressed, the meeting profoundly shaped her worldview, and she became convinced that to thrive, she must be every bit as ruthless and cruel as he was. To that end, she internalized the theme of coldness for her persona, even greeting strangers with condescension unprovoked. In spite of this, and her propensity for blunt, rude responses—even to her fans—she was not above congratulating fellow competitors, especially if they proved their remarkable skill. While her resolution to be emotionless made her asocial, it also meant that she was not one to take scorn or defeats personally. Moreover, she would be motivated by shocking incidents to reflect upon what lessons it held.[1]
            Ice was a blonde-haired woman with pale skin and blue eyes. By her own account, many men that she was disgusted by;found her attractive and her immediate assumption upon meeting Revan was that he was just another male fan who had come to flirt with her.[1]
            Ice's dispassionate attitude was reflected not only in her asociality, but in her combat style as well. Characterized by Marl as a steady fighter, she was confident in her martial expertise and this confidence allowed her to exercise a good measure of control in battle. While not unrivaled in the duel ring, never having been able to surpass Marl or unseat Twitch, she was still lauded as a strong competitor by fans of the sport.[1]
            During her duel with Revan, she opened the fight with her blaster, and in such scenarios, she only switched to her sword if her opponent closed the gap between them.[1] In other cases, she was known to reverse this tactic, hiding a blaster in her clothing to be employed only if a fight turned against her.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_(duelist)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemIce</string></dict>
        <key>Alara</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.6.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alara was a Human female member of the Jedi Order during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. She was present at the Jedi Temple on the Republic capital of Coruscant[2] in 3653 BBY,[1] when the Empire launched a surprise attack on the planet. When the Sith Lord Darth Malgus infiltrated and assaulted the Temple with a strike team of fifty other Sith, Alara joined her fellow Jedi in the defense of their home; she attacked Malgus alongside two of her comrades, but was quickly defeated—the Sith Lord severed Alara's lightsaber-wielding hand and throttled her with his own hand before slamming her into the Temple floor with Force-enhanced strength, killing her. Malgus's forces were victorious in the battle, slaughtering Alara's Jedi brethren before destroying the Temple as a whole in what would prove to be the final battle of the war.[2]
            Alara was first introduced in The Old Republic: Deceived, a novel written by Paul S. Kemp[2] and released in March 2011.[1] Chapter 2, which features Malgus's attack and Alara's death, was released on December 16, 2010, as an excerpt published on StarWars.com.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alara</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAlara</string></dict>

            Nee Alavar first appeared in Star Wars canon in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Portrayed by New Zealander actress Rena Owen, her character's name was given in the film's closing credits.[1] In deleted material from the Revenge of the Sith film, Alavar also appeared with the Delegation of 2,000 addressing Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, a scene which was featured more prominently in the film's novelization.[1][3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nee_Alavar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemNeeAlavar</string></dict>
        <key>Terena Adare</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.9.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Terena Adare was a Human female who had been the Agricultural Administrator of Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War up until that world was sacked by forces of the Sith Empire under the command of Darth Malak. In the wake of the invasion, occupation and eventual departure of the Sith, she became the leader of the surviving colonists, with the seat of government established within the outpost at Khoonda, which had been the former home of Ahlan Matale.
            Darth Malak's devastation of Dantooine in 3956 BBY badly damaged the Jedi Enclave, eliminating the Jedi presence on the planet. After the attack, Adare worked hard to ensure the survival of what was left of the settlers. She sat upon Khoonda, a government tasked with protecting the settlers and regulating their day-to-day affairs—a task formerly entrusted to the Jedi—and was proclaimed the Administrator.
            Realizing that the militia corps alone was not enough to ensure Khoonda's safety, Adare secretly maintained contacts with Jedi Master Vrook Lamar, a former member of the Dantooine Enclave Council and a friend for many years. Unlike most settlers, she trusted the Jedi, remembering the good they had done when the Enclave had stood firmly. However, she understood that the Jedi in general had an extremely bad reputation on Dantooine, and even she could do nothing about it.
            The opportunity to change that fact came in 3951 BBY, the year when relations between the settlers and Azkul's Exchange mercenaries grew especially tense. Unbeknownst to Adare, the mercenaries captured Vrook, preparing to transport him to Nar Shaddaa to claim Goto's bounty. It was at this time that Meetra Surik arrived on Dantooine, looking for Vrook, and the Administrator granted her the permission to search the ruins of the Enclave. In turn, Surik agreed to help the settlers in any way possible.
            Eventually, the Exile's investigation, during which Master Vrook was freed from the mercenaries, triggered an open conflict between them and Khoonda, leading to the Battle of Khoonda, when the mercenaries attempted to infiltrate Khoonda and kill Adare. During the conflict, Surik significantly contributed to the defenses of Khoonda and, along with Vrook, bravely fought the mercenaries, restoring the settlers' faith in the Jedi.
            After the battle, as Dantooine's safe and prosperous future was secured, Adare did her best to ensure that the deeds of Vrook and Surik, and the heritage of the Jedi, would not be forgotten.
            Terena Adare was introduced in the computer and video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, in which she was voiced by Carolyn Seymour.
            If the player chooses the alternate dark side path throughout the game, then Meetra Surik will lend her aid to the mercenaries in their assault on Khoonda, during which Adare is killed by Azkul. Following this, the planet falls under the control of the Exchange.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Terena_Adare</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTerenaAdare</string></dict>
        <key>Ada</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.10.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ada was a female Human slave who present in the Black Vulkar base on Taris during the Jedi Civil War.
            Ada's father owed money to Davik Kang. As he was unable to make ends meet Davik had him killed and sold Ada into slavery to cover the debt. She ended up in servitude to the Black Vulkars. She was gravely mistreated by them. She described being "pawed and groped and kicked and spit on" to Revan when he fought his way through the Vulkar base in search of Bastila Shan, encountered Ada, and declared her free. Delighted but nonetheless frightened, Ada fled the compound into the streets. Her good fortune was cut short when Darth Malak gave his order to bombard Taris.[1]
            The player can ask Ada about Bastila Shan and the prototype accelerator; however, she has information that the player probably already knows.
            If the player follows the dark side, they can kill Ada, saying it's too risky to leave her alive—although if Carth Onasi is in the party, he will stay the player's hand.

            Nyrat Agira was an attractive woman by Human standards, with eyes surgically altered to appear turquoise. She wore her hair in an impractically tall solloops hairstyle, and her soluble zoosha fabric clothing revealed a tattoo marking her as a member of the Zealots of Psusan.[1]
            On the night of the Jedi's apprehension of Wesell, Nyrat was socializing with fellow Outlander patrons Immi Danoo and Rosha Vess, and was on the prowl for potential converts to the Zealots.[3][4] She was approached by a different bounty hunter by the name of Kalyn Farnmir. Farnmir's partner, Cian Shee, had sold Farnmir out to the corrupt High Priest of the Zealots of Psusan, Scri Oscuro. Upon seeing Agira's tattoo, Farnmir intimidated and interrogated the young woman, who confirmed that Oscuro was on Coruscant and had met with Shee.[5]

Apprenticed under the Dark Jedi Desann, Axmis traveled with him to find the lost Valley of the Jedi and served alongside him in Hethrir's Empire Reborn. After her defeat at the hands of Kyle Katarn and Desann's subsequent death, she became the leader of the Disciples of Ragnos cult. She took Alora as her apprentice, and set herself upon the task of resurrecting the ancient Sith Lord Marka Ragnos.
            During Luke Skywalker's search for the cult, she turned Rosh Penin, one of Katarn's apprentices and a student at the Jedi Praxeum, to the dark side of the Force. Katarn and his apprentice Jaden Korr encountered and confronted her, and Penin at Vjun. Following this, Axmis journeyed to the Sith tomb world of Korriban to resurrect Ragnos; Korr was sent to stop her, and he defeated her after a fierce duel. In desperation, Axmis let the spirit of Ragnos fill her, and he guided her body in combat. She was killed after Korr defeated Ragnos, her body unable to withstand the ordeal.
            Originally an Empire Youth in Lord Hethrir's Empire Reborn movement, Tavion Axmis displayed signs of Force-sensitivity and was "purified" by the extra-dimensional being Waru. She received training in the use of her Force abilities under Desann, Hethrir's right hand and failed Jedi trainee; during this training, Axmis was selected by Desann to be his personal apprentice,[3] and the two conceived of a scheme to discover the location of the lost Valley of the Jedi. During the Battle of Artus Prime, Desann and Axmis intercepted Jan Ors, the partner of Kyle Katarn and one of the only two people to know the location of the Valley. Axmis managed to capture her and bring her aboard their shuttle. Katarn arrived to rescue his partner, only to be quickly defeated by Desann. On Desann's order Axmis, in the shuttle and out of Katarn's line of sight, activated her lightsaber and appeared to kill Ors. Desann spared Katarn and boarded his shuttle, leaving the planet with Axmis.[2]
            However, they did not leave the system. When Katarn left in the Raven's Claw, he immediately went to the Valley of the Jedi to regain his former Force-sensitivity, with the intention of using it to exact revenge on Ors's killers. Desann and Axmis followed him there; as Desann piloted their ship to the planet's surface, Axmis contacted Admiral Galak Fyyar to alert him of the Valley's location. Soon after, Axmis and Desann brought the presumed-dead Jan Ors to Admiral Fyyar's flagship, the Doomgiver. After building up a deadly new force known as the Reborn, Axmis left her master's side to oversee Imperial Remnant forces on Bespin who were smuggling cortosis for the shadowtroopers.[2]
            While on Bespin, Axmis confronted Kyle Katarn, whose search for Desann had led him to Cloud City. She taunted him, announcing that they had only killed Ors to trick him into leading them to the Valley, and congratulated him for beginning the "era of Desann." After an intense duel on one of Cloud City's landing platforms, Axmis was overcome by Katarn's superior skill with a lightsaber. Angry over Ors's apparent death, Katarn held Axmis aloft with the Force over the platform's edge. Axmis begged for her life, saying that she was "not brave enough to die", and revealed to Katarn that Ors was alive on board the Doomgiver, which was docked at a base in the Lenico Belt. Katarn spared her, commanding her to get away before Desann found her.[2]
            After obeying Katarn's order and escaping, Axmis lost her master, who was slain by Katarn in the underground of Yavin 4.[2]
            After Desann's death, Axmis took on an eager and sadistic apprentice: the Lethan Twi'lek female Alora. She then acquired an ancient artifact known as the Scepter of Ragnos from a merchant on Commenor, who did not survive their meeting. With the Scepter, she drained areas of the galaxy strong with the Force, and empowered her new followers, creating the Disciples of Ragnos, who sought to resurrect the ancient Dark Lord of the Sith known as Marka Ragnos. She invited surviving Reborn to join her, which became her New Reborn.[1]
            Eventually Axmis made a bold move on Yavin 4, deploying Alora to infiltrate the Jedi Academy to access Luke Skywalker's private record of the locations of Force nexuses, while Axmis and the Kothos twins drained the Force energy at a Massassi Temple. To avoid interference, the energy of the scepter was harnessed to shoot down an arriving shuttle carrying a load of new Padawans. However, Axmis's actions did not go unnoticed; Jaden Korr, a newly arrived Jedi Padawan, made his way to the Temple after being separated from the main group of Jedi on the arriving starship. He spotted Axmis's activity, forcing her to knock him out with the energy of the scepter. Despite Korr's intervention, Axmis and her forces escaped Yavin 4 safely with the valuable data.[1]
            Soon, Luke Skywalker dispatched the Jedi to areas of strong Force energy in an attempt to intercept the cult. One of these students, Rosh Penin, was captured by Axmis on his mission to Byss. She used his fear of being killed against him, and turned Penin to the dark side.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tavion_Axmis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTavionAxmis</string></dict>
        <key>Steela Gerrera</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.13.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Steela Gerrera was a female human who lived on the planet Onderon during the Clone Wars. She fought with the Onderon rebels, and was their leader, taking the position from her brother Saw Gerrera. The efforts of her movement, with assistance from the Jedi, saw the end of Separatist rule through their proxy, King Sanjay Rash, on Onderon and the restoration of the benevolent King Ramsis Dendup. She was romantically involved with the Onderon-born politician Lux Bonteri. Gerrera was killed in the final battle against Onderon's droid garrison and was mourned as a hero of her people.
            When the Confederacy of Independent Systems took control of Onderon, Gerrera, her brother Saw and other insurgents then fled into Onderon's wilderness. There, she and the other insurgents organized themselves into a resistance force. After her brother and former Separatist Senator Lux Bonteri contacted the Jedi Council,[3] she then met the council's envoy, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Knight Anakin Skywalker, his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and clone Captain Rex.[4]
            Gerrera then brought them to their camp, where she, Bonteri, her brother and the other insurgents were trained. At first Gerrera did not like the idea of off-worlders being involved in Onderon's affairs. However, she knew that was how Ramsis Dendup was deposed of by Sanjay Rash.[4] During their training, Gerrera proved herself as a talented sharpshooter. After eliminating a detachment of the droid army, Gerrera and the others planned to infiltrate the capital of Iziz by posing as hunters and foragers. She and the others then split up to gather supplies and meet during the night[3]
            Gerrera knew they needed to win the people's trust. Thus, Gerrera planned an attack on the power generators. She, her brother and Bonteri then took out a droid patrol that then summoned a AAT. Together, they took the tank to the generators and destroyed them. Gerrera was then elected leader of the resistance, much to the chagrin of her brother.[5] Steela then sent out a broadcast to the people, speaking out against Rash and the separatist occupation forces. When news came that Rash planned on executing Dendup, Gerrera knew they did not have the resources to rescue him right away. She planned on rescuing him during his execution, but her brother was then captured by General Kalani's guards. During the execution, Gerrera and the others were able to stop the execution, but were then surrounded by battle droids. However, her brother was able to convince Royal Militia General Tandin and his men to help them escape and free Onderon.[6] Gerrera, her resistance, and the Royal Militia then fled to the Highlands.[2]
            Steela, Ahsoka, and Lux arrived just in time to save the king from the droids. On the nearby battle field, Saw shot down the last of the enemy gunships, but the damaged unit careened out of control, right into the rebel camp. Steela was trapped on a collapsing rock on the edge of a cliffside, broken loose by the droid's impact, and while trying to jump to safety, she was caught hanging from the cliff. Lux rushed to save her, but nearly fell off himself. Ahsoka used the Force to float him to safety, but as she tried to do the same for Steela, the not yet fully disabled gunship wounded her with a laser blast, causing Ahsoka to inadvertently drop Steela to her death.[2]
            Ever since Steela died, Saw carried a hologram projector of his sister to remind him of her. During an investigation on Geonosis, Saw managed to drop the projector of her but it was recovered by Ezra Bridger who asked if the woman in the hologram was Saw's sister, him saying that the image was all he had left of her.[7] During the Destruction of Jedha City, Saw called out to Steela in his last seconds of life after his Partisans' base on Jedha was destroyed by the Galactic Empire.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Steela_Gerrera</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSteelaGerrera</string></dict>

        <key>Kaye Galfridian</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.15.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kaye Galfridian was a Human female and princess of Artorias during the Yuuzhan Vong War in 25 ABY. Her brother was a prince named Finn while her parents were Queen Nina and King Caled.
            During the invasion, Kaye and her mother were captured by the Vong and transferred to the slaveship Tsam P'ah. Kaye volunteered to serve Commander Sha'kel in place of Nina. Later Kaye led an uprising on the Tsam P'ah, aided by fellow prisoner Arbeloa.
            During the early hours of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Kaye was shopping with her mother Nina in the market. As they were talking with her mother's friend Jenny, a loud explosion rocked the marketplace, shattering merchandise and flinging debris across the square. Jenny was severely wounded by the flying debris and collapsed in Nina's arms. As Yuuzhan Vong warriors marched through the marketplace, the queen told her daughter to flee the square. Kaye complied, and ran to get help from her father and brother Finn. She had barely reached the outskirts when she was tripped up by an amphistaff. She looked up in horror to see a towering Yuuzhan Vong warrior standing over her.[1]
            Kaye grabbed a knife on the ground and drove it into the warrior's leg. However, the Yuuzhan Vong pulled the knife from his flesh and tossed it to Kaye, telling her to attack him again. Kaye stabbed again but the warrior still stood. With one final thrust, Kaye managed to kill the Yuuzhan Vong, but was immediately surrounded by more warriors who quickly captured her. Her brother Finn sensed her and their mother being herded towards a Yuuzhan Vong slaveship. Kaye soon found herself in a Yuuzhan Vong holding device with her mother and Jenny.[1]
            Meanwhile, her brother Finn and father Caled had attempted to rescue Kaye and her mother from the marketplace but were forced to retreat to a large hangar where they were besieged by Yuuzhan Vong forces. However, they were rescued by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Finn was recruited by Skywalker for Jedi training at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 after demonstrating his Force ability when he sensed his family in danger. Kaye's father was left behind on Artorias with a company of soldiers to keep the Yuuzhan Vong occupiers at bay and to allow more refugees to escape.[1]
            Kaye, her mother, and her fellow Artorian prisoners were transferred to the Yuuzhan Vong slaveship Tsam P'ah where they languished in awful conditions. A Yuuzhan Vong warrior soon approached Nina Galfridian and demanded that she serve the commander of the ship, striking her when she refused. Kaye stepped in and offered herself up to the commander to spare her mother and to save Jenny. She was brought to Commander Sha'kel and forced to sit before him. The commander questioned how such a young woman could kill one of his warriors and informed her about the Yuuzhan Vong's plans to conquer the galaxy. When he finished, he stabbed Kaye in the shoulder with a coufee and sent her back to her prisoners. When Kaye reunited with her mother, she was told that Jenny had died.[4]
            As Nina had entered a catatonic state after Jenny's death, Kaye took responsibility for the Artorian slaves and continued to serve Commander Sha'kel in order to gain information on their situation and in order to plan an escape. She also met Arbeloa while on the ship, who noted that while the Yuuzhan Vong were afraid of him and had him bound, they should also have restrained Kaye as well and were misjudging her because of her size. Arbeloa later negotiated with Kaye for his freedom in exchange for both his assistance in the coming battle and the head of Commander Sha'kel.[5]
            In a later meeting with Commander Sha'kel, Kaye was informed of the continuing attacks on the planet's surface. When asked by Sha'kel as to the possible source of these attacks, Kaye simply said that the Yuuzhan Vong invasion had left nothing alive on Artorias. As she was sent back with the rest of the prisoners, she noticed that a biot on the guards arm was required to free the prisoners. In addition to finding her mother's state unchanged, she also discovered that Arbeloa had almost freed himself of his bonds and joked that all they needed was an arm rather than a guard if they wished to escape.[6] After Sha'kel deployed reinforcements to the Yuuzhan forces on Artorias, Kaye and Arbeloa staged a diversion in order to draw the guards into an ambush. Using the biot on one of the ambushed guards arms, Kaye then led Arbeloa and the Artorian prisoners into combat against the remaining contingent of Yuuzhan Vong on the Tsam P'ah. Fulfilling her part of their agreement, Kaye allowed Arbeloa to kill Sha'kel and take his head - noting that it was just as well Sha'kel liked pain as it was going to hurt.[7]
            Following the conclusion of the battle, Kaye discovered her mother had recovered after she'd realized her father was still alive and fighting the Yuuzhan Vong on Artorias. Kaye then told her mother how Sha'kel had controlled the ship, but wasn't sure if anyone could use it without being killed. When Nina said their was only one way to find out, Kaye moved to enter the seat before her mother said that this burden was hers to bear. While concerned that her mother was in trouble, Nina assured her daughter that she was fine and could control the ship, using it to escape Artorias and protect the Artorians on the vessel.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kaye_Galfridian</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKayeGalfridian</string></dict>

Known throughout the publishing houses of the planet Coruscant as a woman of uncompromising political ideals, she was commissioned to produce the art piece known as "Taxation Without Federation" for the weekend edition of the HoloNet News, which made a statement against the taxation of trade routes by the Neimoidian-led Trade Federation. The piece became widely distributed throughout the Mid Rim, but was quickly criticized by Trade Federation spin doctors as racist since it depicted the stereotyped image of a fat Neimoidian plutocrat.[1]

        <key>Sarrissa Jeng</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.17.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sarrissa Jeng was a female Human Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic in the waning years of the Republic Classic era.
            Discovered to be Force-sensitive at a young age, Sarrissa Jeng was given to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for induction within the Jedi Order's academy. Trained in the ways of the Force, Jeng eventually graduated and was selected as a Padawan by a Jedi Master. Eventually building herself a blue-bladed lightsaber and passing her Trials of Knighthood, Jeng was made a Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council.[1]
            Active during the Separatist Crisis, a growing division between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Jedi Jeng was dispatched as the leader of a six-member Jedi task force to the Gotal colony world Atzerri. There, Jeng and her team of diplomats were to negotiate the release of Emissary Nathanjo Nirrelz, a Gotal representative taken hostage by the Roshu Sune during the battle of Antar 4. During the negotiations, a group of unaffiliated vigilantes opened fire on the Roshu Shone guerrillas. This attack panicked the Gotal Roshu Shone, who opened fire on their captives. Leaping to defend the unarmed hostages, Jeng and her fellow Jedi managed to subdue the guerrillas on their commuter hopper, but not before Jedi Kaloor Cofi and Antyard-Wo Shissan lost their lives. Emerging from the firefight, Jedi Jeng and Kerrshnek escorted Emissary Nirrelz to safety while the other Jedi helped transport the surviving hostages to medcenters in the nearby cities of Skreeka and Talos.[2]
            After the fighting ended, the surviving Jedi departed for Aleen Minor and the Order's chapter house there for the funerals of Jedi Cofi and Shissan. Meanwhile across the HoloNet News network, the Jedi were heavily criticized by Gotal Foreign Affairs Commune leader Shagrad Loset for what he saw as meddling in an internal affair. Rebuffing this assault on the Order, Jedi Master and High Council member Shaak Ti commended the Jedi effort on Atzerri.[1]
            It wasn't long before tensions between the Confederacy and the Republic came to a head. When the Confederacy captured Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Naboo Senator Padmé Amidala, Master of the Order Mace Windu assembled all available Jedi in a massive strike team. Stationed at the Coruscant Temple at the time, Jeng answered Master Windu's call and departed for the Separatist foundry world, Geonosis, with 200 of her colleagues. Landing on the dusty plains of Geonosis, Jeng and her comrades stormed the Petranaki arena and engaged the Separatist Droid Army on the arena floor, with Jeng herself dispatching a Geonosian warrior with a loud battle cry. Unfortunately, Jeng was ultimately overwhelmed and killed, her name being amongst the 170 Jedi who perished in the battle.[1][3]
            Sarrissa Jeng wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber and was a practitioner of Form VI: Niman. While a skilled warrior, she perished in the Battle of Geonosis due to her preferred style not being able to cope with the sheer number of opponents.[3]
            Sarrissa Jeng was portrayed by Karen Wilson, a student of Byron Bay Kendo Club.
            In a behind the scenes cut that never made the movie, Sarrissa's body can be seen. There is a video titled "Raid on the Droid Control Ship." It is at the end of this video that Sarrissa's body can be seen.
            The Hasbro Star Wars toys infosite Rebelscum.com announced on August 9, 2013 that a Sarissa Jeng action figure was due for release as part of a Geonosis 4-figure Multipack for the end of the same year.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sarrissa_Jeng</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSarrissaJeng</string></dict>

        <key>Galia</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.20.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Galia was a Human female and the Queen of the Inner Rim planet of Onderon during the era of the Great Sith War. Growing up under the pall of the dark side—both of her parents, King Ommin and Queen Amanoa, were Sith cultists—Galia lived during the turbulent period of Onderonian history known as the Beast Wars, when the government of the walled city of Iziz battled exiled criminals known as the Beast Riders who used drexl warbeasts as mounts. At some point, she met Beast Rider leader Oron Kira, and the two fell in love. Knowing that the Princess of Onderon and a Beast-Lord could never be together, they faked a kidnapping in 4000 BBY and went to Kira's fortress in the wilderness beyond Iziz's walls to be married. However, the ceremony was interrupted by three Jedi Knights—brothers Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, and the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta—who were sent by Amanoa to retrieve her daughter. After telling the Jedi their story, Galia and Kira formulated a plan with the Knights to try to convince Amanoa to end the Beast Wars peacefully.
            However, Amanoa rejected their overtures, and they were forced to enact their backup plan, in which a large Beast Rider army attacked Iziz. With the help of Jedi Master Arca Jeth, the Beast Riders were victorious in the final battle of the Beast Wars, with the Queen perishing at the conclusion of the fighting. Galia and Kira consecrated their marriage under the laws of the Galactic Republic and became the new monarchs of Onderon. However, their battles were not at an end, as two years later, Naddist cult members—like Galia's parents, worshipers of former Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd—led a rebellion against their rule. Although the darksiders briefly managed to drive Galia and Kira out of Iziz, the Naddists were ultimately defeated, and peace once again reigned on Onderon. In 3996 BBY, Galia and her husband faced another menace; a Mandalorian fleet attacked Onderon in one of the closing battles of the Great Sith War, but the Mandalorians were defeated. Galia's descendants went on to rule Onderon for thousands of years after her eventual death.
            A Human female, Galia was born in 4018 BBY into royalty as the daughter of King Ommin[2] and Queen Amanoa[1] of the Inner Rim[3] planet of Onderon. Galia grew up in the Royal Palace of the walled city of Iziz, during the turbulent period of Onderon's history known as the Beast Wars, when Iziz waged battle with a clan of exiled dissidents who used the planet's native fauna as mounts.[1] Both of her parents were practitioners of the dark side of the Force;[2] members of the Naddist Sith cult, they worshiped the dead Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd.[4] However, Galia was not a darksider herself.[2] At some point during her childhood, Galia's father fell ill with a wasting disease caused by his use of the dark side and was attached to a mechanical life support exoskeleton deep within a subterranean fortress.[4] One day, Galia met Beast Rider leader Oron Kira, who was secretly in Iziz trading with the political underground, and the two fell in love. Knowing that marriage between the Princess of Onderon and a Beast-Lord was forbidden, she and Kira devised a plan to run away together, in which she would be "abducted" by a team of Beast Riders. She would then stay with Kira in the wilds beyond Iziz's walls, as she had become tired of living under the pall of the dark side.[2]
            In 4000 BBY, a group of three Jedi Knights—brothers Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, and the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta—came to Onderon on a mission to broker a peaceful end to the Beast Wars. Galia and her mother met with the three Jedi in the throne room of the Royal Palace, and it was there that Galia and Kira put their plan into action.[1] Kira and another Beast Rider, Gobee,[5] broke through the throne room's windows on their drexl warbeast and, covered by several waves of reinforcements, successfully made it to the Princess's hiding place and kidnapped her.[1] Galia was taken back to Kira's fortress, where her marriage to Oron Kira promptly began. However, the ceremony was interrupted by Doneeta and the Qel-Droma brothers, who stormed into the castle on tamed boma beasts, as Amanoa had sent them to retrieve her daughter. Ulic Qel-Droma was able to take hold of Galia, but when she revealed that she was willingly marrying Kira, she was released. With the conflict resolved, the Jedi were asked to stay for the wedding banquet. There, Galia, Kira, and Kira's father and grandfather revealed to the Jedi the monarchy's dark side allegiance and asked the Jedi to join them in one final battle to end the Beast Wars. Although Ulic Qel-Droma wanted to work out a peaceful solution with Amanoa, the two sides came to a compromise; Galia, Kira, and the Jedi would go to Iziz and try to broker peace with the Queen, but, if that attempt failed, the Kiras would lead a great Beast Rider army against Iziz.[2]
            In the meeting with the Queen, their peaceful overtures failed. Amanoa declared that the Princess had betrayed her and rejected her daughter's relationship with Kira. Despite Galia's plea that her marriage to the Beast Rider could mark the beginning of a new golden age for Onderon, Amanoa called the power of the dark side down upon their group. Oppressed by the power of Sith magic and under attack by palace guards, Galia led her husband and the Jedi to refuge in[2] her father's old laboratory.[5] With Cay Qel-Droma still stuck in the throne room, Ulic decided to go back for him, telling Doneeta to escort Galia and Kira to his starship, the Nebulon Ranger.[2] However, instead of joining his wife and Doneeta on their trek to the ship, Kira left to join the battle.[5] The Beast Rider army began their assault but soon found themselves overwhelmed by Amanoa's dark power. Just as the Beast Riders seemed to be defeated, Jedi Master Arca Jeth, the teacher of Doneeta and the Qel-Droma brothers, arrived in his ship, the SunGem, and turned the tide of the battle with his battle meditation ability, a development that Galia observed from Iziz's ramparts. Galia and Doneeta were soon joined by Kira and the Qel-Droma brothers as Jeth landed nearby. The Jedi Master led them into the deepest sublevels of the Iziz Royal Palace to find Amanoa; they finally encountered her by the sarcophagus of Freedon Nadd. Amanoa died in Galia's arms, and Galia blamed Jeth for killing her mother. However, Jeth explained that Amanoa's power had fled her and informed Galia that she was finally free from the shadow of the dark side. With the Beast Wars over, Galia and Kira had their marriage consecrated under the laws of the Galactic Republic, turning the two warring tribes of Onderon into one unified society. Galia took her place as Queen of Onderon, with Kira as the new king, in a ceremony that was attended by Jeth and the other Jedi.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galia</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemGalia</string></dict>

            Darkspanner eventually learned of Revan's true fate when the man himself appeared to her in a vision, requesting her to leave Dromund Kaas to find him. Revan, impressed with Darkspanner and all she had accomplished with the Order of Revan, offered her the opportunity to expand the order's roster and purpose. Granted the title of Lord Darkspanner, she served as one of Revan's most trusted commanders until her death on Yavin 4 by joint champions of the Empire and Republic.
            Tari Darkspanner is a character from the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic MMORPG video game. She appears during the Dromund Kaas Revanite missions exclusive to Imperial players.
            Upon the completion of the Revanites' trials, Darkspanner offers the player(s) a way to get the Empire off the trail of the Revanites; she had procured a Sith amulet from Darth Charnus and she wants the player(s) to give it to Sandor to frame his master as the Revanites' leader. The player(s) can either go along with Darkspanner's plan, setting Sandor against Charnus (light side dialogue); or identify Darkspanner to Sandor, allowing the Dark Council to capture her (dark side dialogue). Given that Charnus later appears during the Battle of Corellia, and Darkspanner later re-emerges on Yavin 4, both efforts would not achieve their intended aim.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tari_Darkspanner</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTariDarkspanner</string></dict>

        <key>Irtanna</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.24.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Irtanna was a female Human Republic soldier who joined the Army of Light during the New Sith Wars.
            Around 1001 BBY, she was evacuated from Ruusan, along with thousands of Jedi, just before Dark Lord of the Sith Skere Kaan detonated the thought bomb in the Seventh Battle of Ruusan. She was selected personally by Lord Valenthyne Farfalla to lead the rescue effort on Ruusan, searching for surviving members of the Army of Light.
            When Farfalla refused to allow Johun Othone, Lord Hoth's former Padawan, to join the rescue teams, Othone used a mind trick on Irtanna to persuade her to let him join the team, against Farfalla's orders. During the rescue missions, Irtanna piloted the Star-Wake, an Envoy-class shuttle, which was also crewed by Bordon and his sons, Tallo and Wend. Finally, they came across a little girl who seemed to be a war orphan. The girl was named Rain, but was actually revealed to be Darth Zannah who served as the student of the Sith Lord Darth Bane. As the Star-Wake again opened in the direction of the Republica fleet, Irtanna suddenly heard shots from the hold of the shuttle. As she was about to see what was going on, Irtanna and her crew were murdered by Zannah who came inside the cockpit. After taking the Star-Wake, she set course to Onderon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Irtanna</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemIrtanna</string></dict>
        <key>Earll</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.25.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Earll was a human female who served in the military of the Galactic Empire. By the fifteenth year of the Age of the Empire, she held the rank of commander. Around that time, Earll receptioned a distress call sent by Nadea Tural of the Imperial Senate, but it transpired that the senator had already been rescued by a group of anti-Empire insurgents from Lothal. Along with a squad of stormtroopers, Earll boarded the rebels' ship, the Ghost, and ordered the immediate execution of its crew. Senator Tural, who had demanded a fair trial for the rebels, interposed herself when Earll's troopers were about to fire, allowing the Spectres to get the upper hand. The Imperial commander herself was shot and stunned by Hera Syndulla, the captain of the Ghost.[1]
            Earll was a tall, thin woman with pale sallow skin, ice blue eyes, and short black hair. She was ruthless and unsympathetic, willing to execute the Ghost crew despite the protests of Senator Tural. She appeared more competent than most Imperials encountered by the Ghost crew, personally subduing Sabine Wren and Ezra Bridger while her squad successfully captured the others. Despite succeeding in capturing them, she failed to execute them nonetheless.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Earll</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemEarll</string></dict>
        <key>Ganaire Kyrell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.26.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ganaire Kyrell was a female human Second-wave aristocrat from the planet Jelucan. She was married to Oris Kyrell and was mother to two sons, Dalven and Thane. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Ganaire sought to curry favor with the Empire.
            Ganaire Kyrell was the wife of Oris Kyrell and the mother of Dalven and Thane. She was a Second-waver who lived on the planet Jelucan during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Ganaire and her family were wealthy and lived in a gold-tiled house. In 11 BBY, Ganaire and her family attended a ceremony in the city of Valentia celebrating the Empire's annexation of Jelucan. She complained about walking through the streets like "valley trash", a pejorative referring to the valley-dwelling First Wavers who had settled on Jelucan. Her husband Oris responded that the hangars were packed with hovercraft and that it would do their sons no harm to walk.[1]
            When her older son Dalven complained that they should have left Thane at home with their tutor droid CZ-1, Ganaire sided with Thane and reminded him that he was born in the same year that the Empire was established. After Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin gave a speech, Ganaire and Oris attended a reception with several Imperial dignitaries. They left Dalven to babysit his younger brother. However, Dalven got distracted by his friends and abandoned Thane. Thane subsequently befriend a valley-dweller girl named Ciena Ree. After meeting Tarkin himself, the two decided to strive for a career in the Imperial Navy.[1]
            Ganaire and Oris showered their older son Dalven and ignored Thane. When a fifteen year old Thane was beaten up by his father following an argument, Ganaire did not intervene nor acknowledge her son's wounds in the morning. As a result, Thane endeavored to secure a place at the Imperial Academy and leave his parents and Jelucan behind. When Thane secured a place at the prestigious Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant, Ganaire and Oris said farewell to their son at home and did not accompany him to the spaceport.[1]
            During his studies and subsequent service as a TIE fighter pilot, Thane did not maintain contact with his parents. After deserting the Empire following the destruction of Alderaan, Thane did not seek refuge with his parents; knowing his mother's willingness to curry favor with the Empire and his father's violent temper. After Thane's friend Ciena falsified his death, Ganaire along with Oris and Dalven presumably believed that Thane had committed suicide out of grief at the loss of his comrades aboard the Death Star. In truth, Thane had run away and subsequently joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[1]
            Ganaire was a human woman who wore a long saffron-colored robe. Ganaire and her husband Oris were snobbish and built a large gold-tiled house to impress their neighbors. However, the large size of their house forced them to locate their hangar in the terrace below. As a second-waver, Ganaire looked down upon the Jelucani valley-dwellers, who had first settled the planet. Ganaire was willing to curry favor with the Empire too following its annexation to her homeworld, reason for which Thane, after deserting the Empire, opted to not return to his house knowing his mother's willingness to serve the Empire.[1]
            While she, as her husband, used to favor their older son over their younger son, Ganaire was supportive to Thane sometimes. When Dalven told his parents that they should have left Thane at home during the celebration date of the Empire's annexation of Jelucan, she sided with Thane by reminding him that he was born the same day in which the Empire was established. She also tolerated, along her husband, Thane's friendship with Ciena Ree, despite her being a First Waver, to the extent of letting her go to their house. She even said farewell along her husband to Thane when he departed for the Imperial Academy. However, although Ganaire did not belittle Thane like his father and older brother did, she did not protect Thane when he was beaten up by Oris during one of the latter's drunken rags.[1]
            Ganaire Kyrell first appeared as a background character in Claudia Gray's 2015 young adult novel Lost Stars.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ganaire_Kyrell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemGanaireKyrell</string></dict>
        <key>Harter Kalonia</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.27.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Major Harter Kalonia was a human female who served as a doctor with the New Republic and later the Resistance. She was stationed on the Resistance base on D'Qar thirty years after the Battle of Endor. She notably attended both Chewbacca and Finn after they were wounded at the Battle of Takodana and the Battle of Starkiller Base, respectively.
            In 5 ABY, Doctor Kalonia worked with Leia Organa to ensure her health during pregnancy. Notably, Kalonia recommended that Organa incorporate Jogan fruit into her diet. Han Solo interpreted this rather broadly, and on at least one occasion purchased and delivered an entire armload of jogans for her.[5]
            In 28 ABY,[6] Kalonia served as a medical officer in the New Republic on Hosnian Prime. She had a friendly relationship with Greer Sonnel, Senator Organa's personal assistant, whose bloodburn she treated with occasional injections of Hadeira serum. Following the Napkin Bombing which damaged the New Republic senatorial complex's conference building, Kalonia treated Organa and Sonnel's moderate injuries at a nearby medcenter. She told her patients to stop talking so that she could attend to her work. Later, Kalonia and a med droid loaded a treated Organa onto a transport.[3]
            Later, Kalonia treated Sonnel for a bloodburn attack after she collapsed prior to her mission to Sibensko to investigate Rinnrivin Di's cartel and the Amaxine warriors. After the mission to Sibensko, Kalonia and other New Republic officials and former Rebel Alliance personnel attended a private meeting in the Senate hangar bay where Organa established the Resistance, a paramilitary organization aimed at protecting the Republic from external threats.[3]
            Six years later, Kalonia served as a major in the Resistance, under the command of General Organa, during their conflict with the First Order.[4] She was stationed at the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar. There, she treated the wounded shoulder of the Wookiee Chewbacca. Chewbacca appreciated her kindly demeanor, and Kalonia soothed him as she provided treatment, telling the Wookiee that his story of how he sustained the wounds sounded "very scary" and that Chewbacca "was so brave."[1][7]
            Kalonia also treated the injuries Finn suffered during his fight with Kylo Ren on Starkiller Base, which included nearly fatal lightsaber wounds to the shoulder and spine. Kalonia tended to Finn in the intensive care unit of the D'Qar base, marking one of the few instances in her career that she treated lightsaber wounds. Finn survived, and Kalonia's prognosis was positive, though his final status would not be certain until he fully recovered. After treating Finn, Kalonia personally informed Rey about his recovery.[7] Finn recovered shortly afterwards, as Kalonia promised.[8]
            Harter Kalonia was a light-skinned woman[1] with dark hair and brown eyes.[7] As a physician, she was noted for her good humor and sympathetic bedside manner,[4] and she was warm enough to offer even the most hardened soldier comfort.[9]
            Harter Kalonia was a competent physician. Despite having little experience with the treatment of lightsaber wounds, she still managed to save Finn's life. In addition to speaking Galactic Basic,[7] Kalonia was also fluent in other languages such as Shyriiwook, which made her a good ear for Wookiee patients.[4]
            The uniform worn by Kalonia reflected both her military and medical roles. The silver and red rank badge of an army major was attached to the left side of her chest, and the dark armband of medical services (bearing the word "MED" in aurebesh) was wrapped around her left upper arm. Kalonia used a well-equipped medical field kit that allowed her to treat blaster burns. It contained antiseptic field generators, bacta bulbs, and synthflesh dispensers.[4] While Kalonia was known for her compassion and sly humor, she also ensured that her patients complied with her instructions.[3]
            Kalonia was portrayed by Harriet Walter in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens (2015). Walter, who also portrayed Lady Shackleton in the television series Downton Abbey, is the niece of the late Sir Christopher Lee, who portrayed Darth Tyranus in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith (2005).[10][11] A deleted scene from The Force Awakens depicts Kalonia telling Rey "your friend's going to be just fine," referring to Finn,[12] a sequence that was presented in detail in the film's novelization.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Harter_Kalonia</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemHarterKalonia</string></dict>
        <key>Kycina</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.28.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kycina was a female Human Nightsister who lived on the planet Dathomir and was the mother of the Sith Lord Darth Maul, as well as his brothers Savage Opress and Feral. She was affiliated with the Witches of Dathomir, a cult of Force-sensitive beings led by Mother Talzin. Shortly after Maul's birth, Kycina persuaded Darth Sidious to take her son away from Dathomir, thus sparing him from a life of slavery as a Nightbrother.
            By the year 54 BBY, the Nightsister Kycina was the mother of two Dathomirian Zabrak infants, one of whom was named Maul. By tradition on the planet Dathomir, the father was killed shortly after Maul's conception. Kycina believed that Mother Talzin, the leader of the Witches of Dathomir, only knew of one of the two brothers. Thus she kept Maul's existence a secret while waiting for a chance to spirit him away from Dathomir. By doing so, she hoped to save Maul from becoming one of the Nightbrothers, a clan of Zabraks trained to serve the Nightsisters as warriors and slaves.[1]
            Kycina's opportunity came less than a year after young Maul's birth. Darth Sidious, the Sith persona of Naboo Ambassador Palpatine, visited Dathomir out of interest in its relation to Sith history. While exploring Blue Desert City, Sidious was approached by Maul's mother. Kycina implored the Sith Lord to take her son from her and raise him away from Dathomir, far from Talzin's reach. Though initially reluctant to accept her offer, Sidious was ultimately persuaded by Maul's strong sensitivity to the Force.[1]
            Unsure of what to do with his new charge, Sidious approached his Master, Darth Plagueis, with an offer: to train Maul in the ways of the dark side of the Force. Although such an action technically violated the Rule of Two, which allowed for only two Sith Lords to exist at any given time, Plagueis granted his apprentice permission to proceed with Maul's indoctrination. However, the Dark Lord was also clear that the Zabrak was to be an assassin rather than a fully trained Sith Lord. Under Sidious' tutelage—and Plagueis' observation—Kycina's son grew up to become Darth Maul, a Sith warrior deeply immersed in the dark side.[1]
            In 39 BBY, Mother Talzin learned of Kycina's betrayal, and in turn had her locked away and later punished.[2] During the Clone Wars in 21 BBY,[3] her other son Savage Opress[2] became secretly apprenticed to the Nightsister Asajj Ventress, who sought to use the powerful Dathomirian pawn to exact revenge on her former master and betrayer, Darth Tyranus. As a sign of his immersion in the dark side of the Force at the behest of Ventress, Opress committed fratricide by murdering his brother Feral.[3] After reuniting with Darth Maul in 20 BBY,[4] the two surviving sons of Kycina quickly established themselves as a threat to the Jedi Order.[5]
            By 20 BBY, her son Savage Opress would die on Mandalore at the hands of Darth Sidious, the very man who she gave Maul to.
            The Nightsister who gave birth to Darth Maul deeply cared for her son. While Kycina's other offspring was fated to serve Mother Talzin as a Nightbrother, she desperately wanted to give Maul a chance to live a different life; a life of freedom from an entire clan that was bred and raised for slavery to the Witches of Dathomir. Hence, she was willing to be forever parted from her son, so long as it meant that he would be taken away from Dathomir.[1]
            Kycina was first introduced as the mother of Darth Maul in the Legends novel Darth Plagueis.[1] She was first identified as "Kycina" in the short story Restraint, which also confirms her status as the mother of Savage Opress and Feral.[2]
            The 2014 comic Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir, Part Three, part of the official Star Wars canon and based on unproduced scripts from Star Wars: The Clone Wars, revealed that Mother Talzin is Maul's mother.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kycina</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKycina</string></dict>
        <key>Kalifa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.29.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kalifa was a female human Jedi youngling who once studied to become a Knight of the Jedi Order during the final years of the Galactic Republic.
            She was captured and taken to Garnac's hunting guild on the moon Wasskah. After being released on Island Four on Wasskah, she led a small team with two other youngling captives, O-Mer and Jinx, managing to survive by staying hidden and out of combat with the members of Garnac's hunting guild.
            After her capture by Lo-Taren and subsequent transfer to Island Four, Ahsoka Tano was determined to change the indifference Kalifa, O-Mer, and Jinx showed toward the other prisoners as they are hunted. After Ahsoka ambushed a lone Trandoshan, Kalifa levitated him with a Force choke and attempted to kill him, but was stopped by Ahsoka, as it would have been killing out of hatred. The captive Trandoshan was then able to call for help and the Jedi were forced to retreat. After the successful ambush, Kalifa began to hope that Ahsoka, as a more advanced Force user, could help them escape.
            The next morning the hunting resumed, forcing the group to split up. Kalifa accompanied Ahsoka and was shot off a briar branch landing, winded and injured, on the ground, with Dar in hot pursuit. Before he could shoot her, Ahsoka ambushed Dar and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, which ended with him falling on a stalagmite, killing him. Enraged, Garnac, who was Dar's father, opened fire on the two young Jedi, fatally injuring Kalifa.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kalifa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKalifa</string></dict>

        <key>Kylantha</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.31.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kylantha was a Human female from Naboo and the successor to Queen Apailana, formally styled Her Royal Highness, Queen Kylantha of Naboo. She was installed as a puppet ruler in 18 BBY after her predecessor was killed on the orders of the Galactic Empire for allegedly harboring Jedi survivors of Order 66. Unlike previous monarchs, Kylantha had exceeded her two terms of office by the time of the Battle of Yavin.
            Kylantha succeeded Apailana to the throne of Naboo in 18 BBY,[2] after the latter was executed by the Galactic Empire for treason.[3]
            Although Queen Kylantha was outwardly loyal to the Empire, she refused to dissolve the Naboo Royal Advisory Council and, unlike other Imperial-held worlds, had only implemented a few changes to Naboo's democratic government. This led many Imperials, including Chief Inquisitor Loam Redge, to believe she was actually a Rebel Alliance sympathizer. Kylantha's personal view towards the Empire remained ambiguous.[4]
            During her reign, Kylantha appointed Pooja Naberrie, the younger niece of the beloved Naboo politician Padmé Amidala, as Naboo's representative in the Imperial Senate, a position Naberrie held until Emperor Palpatine dissolved that governmental body in 0 BBY.[1]
            During the Galactic Civil War, Emperor Palpatine came to believe that Queen Kylantha was secretly hiding a Rebel general named Jacen Nire. Knowing that trying to force the Queen to give up Nire and/or arresting her for treason would result in Naboo openly turning against the Empire in spite of it being his homeworld, Palpatine resorted to alternate means to get rid of the Rebel general: Instead of having her arrested for treason, Palpatine assigned an unidentified Imperial spacer to help him manipulate the Queen without any blame falling on the Empire.[1]
            First, the spacer had to create, with the help of a mercenary leader named Vurrha Jantsk, a datadisk that implicated the Rebel Alliance in an alleged plot against the Queen. Afterwards, they had to discreetly assist Jantsk's mercenaries in the attack on Kylantha's chambers by ridding the Queen of her security guards. They subsequently had to go talk to the Queen, who was not yet convinced of the Rebel Alliance's guilt. As "proof" of this, the spacer gave Kylantha the falsified datadisk, which eventually led her to give up General Nire's location, who was hiding outside the city of Dee'ja Peak.[1]
            The Imperial spacer then proceeded to assassinate the Rebel general. Kylantha claimed to be shocked that the Rebels "made" a personal attack on her, the Queen of Naboo, and requested the Imperial to tell the Emperor that he had her full support.[1]
            At some point during her reign, Kylantha sent the Wookiees Orrekazzapirr, Drrlirm, and Imarrra to their homeworld of Kashyyyk to investigate whether the Imperial force stationed on the planet was assisting the Trandoshan slavers. When she didn't receive any news from the Wookiees, Kylantha grew worried. However, a spacer arrived in Theed that Kylantha had heard many stories about from some of her staff. The adventurer agreed to fly to Kashyyyk and investigate the whereabouts of the Wookiees. The Queen had chosen the right being: not only did the adventurer find Drrlirm in the Kashyyykian jungles and escort him to Kachirho, but tracked the other two Wookiees to the Imperial prison on Dathomir where they had been brought and helped them escape from the planet and through the Imperial blockade. As a token of her appreciation for his help, Kylantha presented the adventurer with an old, rehauled ARC-170 starfighter.[5]
            Shortly after, the Queen invited the Ewok Chief Chirpa and his tribe to come to Naboo during their Festival of Love.[6]
            Mikdanyell Guh'rantt, the mayor of Mos Eisley on Tatooine, once contacted Kylantha and several regional governors across the galaxy about the increasing commotion that plagued his city. It turned out that this problem did not concern only Mos Eisley. Kylantha, Guh'rantt, and the others eventually agreed to work together to put an end to that nuisance.[7]
            At one point it was also said that a young and wealthy suitor, in an attempt to win her heart in marriage, purchased a quadrant of the Naboo system. However, Kylantha politely refused his offer, saying that she had "married" her people and wished to serve them with all of her time. Heartbroken, the suitor renamed the quadrant "Kylantha's Whim."[8]
            Kylantha was eventually replaced by Queen Mairayni.[9]
            Kylantha was a non-player character in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies prior to its closure on December 15, 2011.[1] Rebel players could take a quest from her where they had to rescue Wookiee slaves. They received an ARC-170 starfighter as a reward.[5]
            The Queen's loyalties seem to be rather ambiguous. Outwardly, she was supportive of the Empire, but inwardly she appeared to be sympathetic to the Rebellion. Indeed, Emperor Palpatine saw to it that the Queen remained loyal to the Empire by making it appear as if the Rebellion were performing unethical acts.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kylantha</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKylantha</string></dict>
        <key>Swilla Corey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.32.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Swilla Corey was a female Human jerba tender and pickpocket who lived on the planet of Tatooine. Born a slave, she was liberated by raiding Karazak slavers while her master was visiting Tatooine. She decided to make a new life for herself on the desert planet, and continued doing what she had done as a slave: tended to animals. She found limited amounts of work at local ranches, and was able to make ends meet.
            Her success came to an end, however, when her jerba herd was scattered by a sandstorm. Financially ruined, Corey moved to Mos Eisley, and became a pickpocket. Eventually, she passed on her skills to initiates in the art of thievery. One day, she spotted one of her jerbas outside Chalmun's Cantina, and investigated. She discovered that the alien Ketwol had chanced upon it, as it had wandered out of the desert. The Pacithhip helped her rebuild her jerba herd, allowing Corey to return to her former home.
            Born into a life of slavery, the Human female Swilla Corey worked as an animal hand under a Tarnab merchant, gaining experience and knowledge. While in orbit above Tatooine, the merchant was attacked by Karazak slavers. Corey was able to escape to the planet surface unharmed, and, with her newfound freedom, she decided to use her skills with animals to forge a new life for herself.[1]
            Working on a jerba ranch near the Motesta Oasis, Corey set up residence in an abandoned hut nearby. She would travel the countryside, through farming communities, trading jerba leather, milk, and meat. Though she was never financially secure, Corey was satisfied with just reveling in her freedom—a stark contrast from her upbringing in slavery.[1]
            Corey's entire jerba herd was scattered during a sandstorm, and the added antagonism of a wild anooba pack did not help. With no assets whatsoever, Corey abandoned her hut, and moved to Mos Eisley. There, she was forced to resort to petty thievery and begging. Eventually, she began passing on her robbery skills to other initiates in the craft. One day, she saw her brand on a jerba outside Chalmun's Cantina, and she entered to investigate. Consulting one of her colleagues, the Yam'rii Kitik Keed'kak, she was told that the jerba belonged to a Pacithhip named Ketwol. Seeking answers, she hurried outside in order to wait for Ketwol, just as the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi stirred up trouble in the cantina by attacking Ponda Baba and Cornelius Evazan.[1][2]
            Tailing the Pacithhip to his starship, the Herd Mother, Corey discovered that Ketwol was using the battered ship as a home. Seeking the right moment, she attempted to steal the jerba, but Ketwol detected the thievery, and stopped her. He explained that the animals had wandered out of the desert towards his ship, and as some of them had been exhausted or wounded, he had cared for them. In turn, Corey told her tale of misfortune, and Ketwol decided to give her shelter. Eventually, Swilla gathered her jerbas and returned to the desert, with the knowledge that she could always return to the hospitality and companionship of Ketwol.[1]
            Bereft of lofty ambitions, Swilla Corey, upon being freed, was content with just making ends meet. Instead of making her new life a bountiful one, she preferred a simple existence with her jerba herd, as it was probably the only thing she knew how to do well. However, her lack of credits drove her to thievery when she lost her herd. Corey eventually grew proficient in this craft, and was adept at passing her skills onto others. She was also particularly curious, and did not give up the hope of finding her herd after the sandstorm that had scattered it.[1][2]
            Originally appearing in George Lucas' A New Hope and played by an uncredited Mandy Morton, the character that would eventually become "Swilla Corey" was simply known as "Local girl".[3] Eventually, the character was given the name of "Swilla Corey" in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game set, A New Hope Limited, which also established the fact that she was a thief. "Swilla Corey" is in fact an anagram of Carol Wisely, a Decipher employee.[4] In 2005, Corey's backstory was elaborated on by Tim Veekhoven through the first round of the Hyperspace feature, "What's The Story?". Veekhoven initially meant to have Momaw Nadon as the character who aids Corey, but changed it to Ketwol after reading in The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide that Pacithhip often herded jerbas. The change was made due to the fact that Veekhoven believed that Nadon had already appeared in a plethora of Expanded Universe material, and as jerbas had already been written into his entry, this change seemed natural.[5] Swilla Corey was later given an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Swilla_Corey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSwillaCorey</string></dict>

        <key>Miara Larte</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.34.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Captain Miara Larte was a human female, the younger sister of Kaeden Larte. After participating in the uprising on Raada in the early reign of the Galactic Empire, she became an A-wing pilot, then an X-wing pilot, and later joined the Alderaanian consular security, a branch of the Rebel Alliance military. She had a talent for making locks and explosives.
            Miara and her family moved to the remote Outer Rim moon of Raada when she was very young. She was three years younger than her older sister, Kaeden. When Miara was eleven and Kaeden was fourteen, their parents were killed in a farming accident. Kaeden, although not yet a legal adult, became Miara's guardian. Vartan, the leader of the work crew Miara and Kaeden's parents had been on, hired Kaeden as a gesture of kindness so the girls had some income. By the time Miara was fourteen, in 18 BBY, she was also working on the crew, even though she was technically too young. Vartan gave her lighter hours, due to her age. That year, Miara and Kaeden befriended "Ashla", a Togruta woman close in age to Kaeden who had recently come to Raada and set herself up as a mechanic. Miara, on Kaeden's request, installed a lock with an explosive security feature on Ashla's door. Unbeknownst to the sisters, "Ashla" was actually the former Jedi Padawan and Order 66 survivor Ahsoka Tano, who had come to the moon running from the Galactic Empire. Several weeks after Ashla's arrival, a Star Destroyer arrived at Raada with a garrison, as part of an Imperial plan to utilize the moon's farmland to grow a crop that leeched nutrients from the soil. Tano began covertly organizing a resistance, and Miara, due to her talent for bomb-making, was swiftly included. However, the farmer Hoban, another member of Vartan's work crew, chafing at what he saw as "Ashla"'s excessive caution, secretly organized another resistance group under her nose, and included both of the Larte sisters.[1]
            Tano had planned a quiet strike against the Imperial garrison, to sneak in and plant acid bombs that would destroy the legs of the garrison's walkers. Hoban, however, had secretly planned an attack on the garrison that same night, involving himself, Kaeden and his sister Neera, intending to use the sabotage mission to keep "Ashla" occupied elsewhere. Miara was with Tano and Kolvin, planting the acid bombs, when Tano discovered powerful explosives in her bag, which she had built at Hoban's request. Tano forced Miara to come clean about Hoban's plans, and sent Miara to Selda's cantina while she tried to rescue the farmers. In the futile attack, Hoban was killed, and Tano exposed herself as a Force-user. The Larte sisters, Kolvin, and the traumatized Neera were forced to hide in the caves outside of town that Tano had been preparing. Miara was shocked at "Ashla"'s deception, but not as much as Kaeden, who, furious, made the mistake of returning to town, getting arrested by Imperial forces outside Vartan's house. Tano was forced to go rescue Kaeden, before having to leave Raada, promising to return.[1]
            For many weeks, Miara, Kaeden, Neera and Kolvin lived in the caves, passing their time with games of crokin. During this time, an Inquisitor, the Sixth Brother, came to Raada looking for Tano. He located the rebels' hideout, and demanded Kaeden surrender herself. The rebels prepared to ambush him, but Miara, on Kaeden's request, was stunned by Neera so she couldn't come along. She awoke to find her sister missing and Neera and Kolvin dead, slaughtered by the Inquisitor. When Tano returned to Raada shortly thereafter, she found Miara camping a few hours' walk out of town, and Miara told her what had happened. Tano, before rescuing Kaeden, sent Miara to Selda and Vartan to inform them of the arrangements in place for the evacuation of the people of Raada, made with the help of Bail Organa. Miara and Kaeden were evacuated on the Tantive IV, which was the last ship to leave. Miara was fascinated by the rebel pilots, and expressed interest in fighting for the rebellion once she was old enough.[1]
            Initially, Miara, Kaeden and the other Raadan refugees were settled in refugee camps on Alderaan. She received pilot training, and eventually became a rebel pilot, a process made easier by the heavy losses the rebellion sustained in those early, less-organized days. In 9 BBY, she was promoted to captain at a ceremony where Queen Breha Organa, Viceroy Bail and Princess Leia were present. Shortly thereafter, she received her first mission from Fulcrum, who Miara instantly recognized as Tano from the symbol. Knowing she had to keep it a secret, she chose her words carefully when she told Kaeden about it. Miara eventually came to serve in the Alderaanian consular security, and regarded the planet as her second home. In 0 ABY, she and her crew were present at the Great Temple on Yavin 4 for the medal ceremony honouring the heroes of the Battle of Yavin.[2]
            Miara was a friendly young woman, but initially had some distrust for "Ashla", sensing that she was hiding something. She was also somewhat naïve, despite her considerable talents for building explosives, and was traumatized after Neera and Kolvin's deaths.[1] Over the course of her years serving the rebellion, she gained considerable experience as a starfighter pilot, and adopted Alderaan as a second home. The Disaster left her in mourning, as it did her subordinates who were mostly born on Alderaan. She faced criticism from some native-born Alderaanians for this because she wasn't born there. However, Miara did not let this stop her from being a comforting figure to her crew, as she had already experienced the loss of her previous home, Raada. After spending so much of her life in starships, Miara enjoyed breathing real air whenever she had the chance.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Miara_Larte</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMiaraLarte</string></dict>

She and her husband were killed in 25,793 BBY, when they were defending the Je'daii Temple Kaleth during the conflict known as the Despot War.
            A Human female member of the Je'daii Order on the planet Tython, the woman had a daughter named Shae Koda with her husband, another Je'daii of Dathomiri descent like her. Koda's mother was fair-skinned with orange hair kept in a ponytail, wearing armor and a green triangle tattoo on her forehead, and she bore her daughter sometime before the year 25,805 BBY, when the Twi'lek Despot Queen Hadiya attempted to conquer the Tython system in the Despot War. Koda's parents fought the Despot Army on Tython, but both were killed by Hadiya at the gates of Kaleth, the Temple of Knowledge. Though the war ended with a Je'daii victory, Koda grew up an orphan and resented her parents for abandoning her. In 25,793 BBY, while in the Rift—a ravine on Tython saturated with the dark side—Koda encountered visions of her parents and attacked them in rage.[2] In 25,792 BBY, Koda's parents appeared in a vision to her in the depths of the Chasm on Tython.[3]

        <key>Ru Murleen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.39.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ru Murleen, a Human female, was a starfighter pilot in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Murleen was the youngest pilot to reach the rank of commander and became a pilot instructor at the Rebel training facility on Kolaador, hoping to pass her skills on to others. Shortly after the Battle of Toprawa in 0 BBY, Murleen led a group of X-wing starfighters to Tatooine, where Anchorhead Base was under attack by Imperial forces, and later fought Imperial TIE fighters during the evacuation of Gamma Base on Hoth. She transferred to the Great Temple on Yavin 4 soon after and fought against the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin.
            Murleen was later assigned to Imdaar Alpha to monitor Imperial activity on the planet. When the Alliance learned of an Imperial project to create cloaked starfighters, Murleen teamed up with her former student, Rookie One, on a mission to infiltrate the Super Star Destroyer Terror and steal one of the TIE Phantoms. The two Rebel agents not only acquired one of the new starfighters, but were able to use it to destroy the Terror, along with the TIE Phantom factory at Imdaar Alpha, effectively putting an end to the project.
            Ru Murleen joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic as a starfighter pilot early in the Galactic Civil War. Her skill and daring attitude helped her to move through the ranks quickly and,[3] by 0 BBY,[4] she had been promoted to commander[3]—the youngest in the Alliance Starfighter Corps at the time.[5] Hoping to pass on her skills to others, Murleen took a position as an instructor[3] at a Rebel training facility on Kolaador, a position she held for much of the base's existence.[6] Murleen would lead rookie pilots in R-22 Spearheads through the planet's canyons, whose crystalline spires formed a natural obstacle course.[1] While serving on Kolaador, she trained many new pilots for the Alliance, who went on to serve throughout the galaxy.[7]
            Among her students was "Rookie One," who undertook the final phase of his training under her instruction shortly after the Battle of Toprawa, during which the Rebel Alliance stole plans to the Death Star, a battlestation with enough power to destroy a planet. Murleen was impressed by the young pilot's skill and, after he passed his canyon run, she joined him for a celebratory drink at the Rebel base while he awaited assignment to a squadron. However, their drink was cut short by the news that Anchorhead Base on Tatooine, Rookie One's base for his earlier training, was under attack by Imperial forces searching for the stolen plans.[1]
            Anchorhead Base was unable to hold off the Imperial forces for long, so Murleen assembled a flight of T-65 X-wing starfighters and headed to Tatooine to assist them. To join her on the mission, she selected Rookie One and Thurlow Harris. When the group arrived in the Tatoo system, they found an Imperial-class Star Destroyer in orbit of Tatooine. Knowing that the group's chances on the surface would be slim with the Star Destroyer coordinating the attack, Murleen led her group in an attack on its command center, hoping to eliminate the threat before proceeding down to Tatooine. The group engaged TIE/LN starfighters launched by the Star Destroyer, while strafing the starship to weaken its defenses. When the deflector shields protecting the bridge finally fell, Murleen instructed Rookie One to arm his proton torpedoes and commence an attack run on the unprotected command tower. Rookie One scored a direct hit, crippling the vessel. With the threat eliminated, the group quickly proceeded to the surface to help the Rebels below.[1]
            After entering the atmosphere, Murleen contacted Lieutenant Turland Hack at Anchorhead Base for a status report. Hack informed the group that the base was already under attack from three TIE fighters. Despite their best efforts, the group was unable to reach the base in time, and it was destroyed moments later. The attacking TIE fighters were now alerted to the presence of the Rebel reinforcements, and Murleen took her group into Beggar's Canyon to eliminate them before they could report to their commanders. After all three were eliminated, the Rebels were joined by the X-wing of Captain Merrick Simms. Imperial ground forces were already moving into Mos Eisley, and Murleen ordered Harris and Rookie One to join Simms in engaging the All Terrain Scout Transports and Imperial landing craft. Meanwhile, Murleen attempted to cut off the Imperial supply lines, and instructed the others to withdraw once the situation got too dangerous, and to rendezvous with her at the fleet, before proceeding to Gamma Base[1] on the ice-world of Hoth.[8]
            All four Rebel pilots made it safely to Gamma Base. However, their escape would be short-lived. The Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, determined to locate where they had fled to, had Viper probe droids dispatched throughout the Anoat sector. When the droids discovered Gamma Base, Imperial forces moved to attack it and the Rebels were forced to evacuate. Murleen led an X-wing group charged with protecting the last Rebel GR-75 medium transport to leave while it attempted to escape to hyperspace. Joined by Rookie One, who was delayed in leaving the planet, the group engaged waves of TIE fighters, keeping them away from the transport until it safely jumped out of the system. Once the Rebel pilots were clear of the Imperial fighters, they followed the transport to safety.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ru_Murleen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRuMurleen</string></dict>
        <key>Bazine Netal</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.40.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bazine Netal was a human female mercenary. She was present in Maz Kanata's castle approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor. Netal informed the First Order of the presence of BB-8 in Kanata's castle.
            Bazine Netal was born on the planet Chaaktil with a name that she later kept secret. As a child, she was taken from an orphanage in Chaako City by Delphi Kloda and raised in Kloda's combat school where she learned a range of deadly martial arts. Kloda nicknamed her "Chaakrabbit."[2]
            When Netal was fourteen years old, Kloda sent her to steal an item from one of his competitors. She was quickly discovered by her mark, who burned her with a flamethrower. Despite this, Netal was able to kill her attacker and complete her goal, though she was left with burn scars on the left side of her scalp.[2]
            Thereafter, Netal became a feared bounty hunter and master of disguise, learning from teachers other than Kloda as well. At some point, she adopted the pseudonym "Bazine Netal." She based her operations on Chaaktil around Suli's cantina.[2]
            Six years after having left Chaako City, Netal received an assignment from an anonymous client. Her assignment was to retrieve a steel case which was in the possession of former Imperial stormtrooper Jor Tribulus. Netal's client warned her that a competitor known as "Narglatch" would also be hunting for the case.[2]
            Netal visited Kloda in order to borrow his ship, the Sparrowhawk. Kloda leant her the vessel on the condition that she take Kloda's student, the skilled Pantoran slicer Orri Tenro, along on her mission as a part of his training. Reluctantly, Netal agreed, hoping that Tenro's slicing ability would outweigh the risk he posed to her mission. As they left for the planet Vashka, Tenro proved to be incompetent with anything aside from computers.[2]
            On Vashka, Netal and Tenro infiltrated the medcenter where Tribulus was most recently recorded as a patient. There they were able to learn the location of Tribulus's retirement facility. Before disembarking for that site, Netal injected Tenro with a poison which rendered him unconscious.[2]
            Netal discovered that the retirement home had been overtaken by apidactyls. She made her way inside the building by distracting the apidactyls with a thermal detonator. There she met Aric Nightdrifter, a retired stormtrooper who had been living in the building, and he led her to Tribulus's remains.[2]
            Netal was taken by surprise when Kloda appeared and revealed that he was Narglatch, and he had raised Netal for the sole purpose of sending her after the case in order to steal it himself. After taking the case from Tribulus's corpse and disarming Netal, Kloda trapped Netal in the grave of apidactyl wax and escaped.[2]
            Using the materials Nightdrifter had buried with Tribulus, Netal was able to escape the building. She threw a detonator ahead of Kloda's narglatch, creating a hole in the ground and trapping Kloda. After a brief struggle, Netal killed Kloda and returned to the Sparrowhawk with the case.[2]
            During the First Order's conflict with the Resistance, Netal served as one of the Order's spies. When she was at Maz Kanata's castle on Takodana,[4] Netal posed as Grummgar's girlfriend.[source?] As soon as the Millennium Falcon's captain Han Solo arrived with Rey, Finn, and BB-8, she informed the Order of the droid's location.[4]
            Sometime later, Netal was hired by a employer to search for the Millennium Falcon. She heard a rumor that IG-88 nearly caught it, so she met with IG-88 to discuss about the Millennium Falcon. During their discussion, IG-88 told Netal the story of when he almost caught the Falcon with Agent Kallus. IG-88 also told Netal that he almost had the Millennium Falcon again, but the bounty hunter Boba Fett got to Solo and the Falcon first. Netal responded that IG-88 had a lot of excuses and that her employer only paid for results. Before she left to continue her search, Netal informed IG-88 that someone knew where the Falcon was and that they would tell her where it was.[5]
            Netal later met with two droids, Doc and Teetee. They told Netal a story of when they encountered the Millennium Falcon on Lotho Minor. After the story, Netal told them that it wasn't even close to what she wanted. When she asked where she could find the Falcon, the pair didn't know as they hadn't seen it since Lotho Minor. Netal became angry but Teetee said that he knew the bounty hunter Embo had come into contact with her quarry. Netal left the droids and went to find Embo.[6]
            Netal made her way to Felucia where she found Embo. Knowing that Embo's funding from the New Republic had stopped, she made a deal with the Kyuzo where in exchange for credits, he would give her information she needed, about his encounter with the Millennium Falcon. After Embo told Netal a story of when he failed to capture the Falcon on a space station not long after the Battle of Endor, Netal questioned why it had been so hard to capture one ship. Following Embo's response, Netal replied that she would do more than try and capture it, she would succeed. After paying Embo the credits they agreed upon, he told her that he had heard the ship had surfaced somewhere. Finding the information from Embo interesting, Netal added that if there was anyone that wanted to capture the Falcon as much as her employer, it would be "her". Netal then set off for her next destination.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bazine_Netal</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBazineNetal</string></dict>

        <key>Lomi Plo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.42.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lomi Plo was a Human female Nightsister and a Sith Master, active during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
            Lomi may have once been affiliated with the Shadow Academy and the Second Imperium, but by the time she was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong, she was a member of Darth Krayt's One Sith. Rescued by the Myrkr strike team, she aided them in their mission against the voxyn, but she and fellow Sith Welk then stole the Tachyon Flier with Raynar Thul onboard. They escaped into the Unknown Regions and apparently created the Gorog, a Killik nest, unknown to the other nests. Lomi was responsible for the Dark Nest Crisis and the Swarm War.
            At the conclusion of the Swarm War, Lomi was killed by Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker.
            Lomi Plo was a Nightsister, possibly a member of the Great Canyon Clan under Tamith Kai. By the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, she was a member of the new Sith order based on Korriban, acting as Sith Master to the Togorian Morto.
            Along with an apprentice, she was sent to escort Lumiya to join their group at its base. However, they were cut off from their destination by the unexpected speed of the Yuuzhan Vong advance, and Lomi and her apprentice were captured by the invaders.
            Lomi subsequently found herself enslaved alongside Welk and other Force-sensitives aboard the worldship Baanu Rass, as specimens for human experimentation, and especially as live prey for the voxyn. After being rescued by the Myrkr strike team, she took vengeance on her captors by creating a Force net and slowly contracting it, ultimately slicing a Yuuzhan Vong shaper into pieces. This act greatly unnerved Anakin Solo, but impressed Alema Rar, who was still mourning the death of her sister. The members of the strike team were less than pleased to discover that they had rescued two Dark Jedi — and would have been even less pleased if they had known at the time that they were Sith.
            Using their knowledge of the worldship, Lomi and Welk guided the strike team, but were perturbed when they discovered the nature of the mission. In order to escape, they stole the Tachyon Flier, injuring Lowbacca and abducting Raynar Thul in the process. The ship eventually crashed in the Unknown Regions, severely burning all three aboard, leaving them scarred and deformed.
            Lomi and Welk were incorporated into the Killik nest that rescued them and, through their knowledge of the Force, they appear to have created the Gorog nest. Lomi became known as the Unseen Queen of this Dark Nest. Because Lomi wanted nothing more than to hide, the nest had taken on that characteristic and hid from the other nests. Lomi also gained the ability to render herself invisible to someone who had doubt in their mind. Because of this, the extent of Lomi's injuries were unknown, but in later encounters Lomi was revealed to have had a pair of Killik arms above her Human ones, her eyes were replaced with Killik eyes, her lower jaw was replaced with a Killik mandible, and one of her legs was replaced by a Killik leg.
            In 35 ABY, the Dark Queen was present with the Dark Nest in the Qoribu system, at Kr. She and the Night Herald Welk worked with Alema Rar to engage Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker. Lomi fluttered around the edge of the battle, invisible to the combatants, draining the power cells of the Jedi whenever she was able to. Luke, wielding Alema Rar's lightsaber and his own, lost both weapons, but still killed Welk. Lomi thrashed out while trying to kill Luke by throwing him into Gorog larvae, but Luke survived, and Lomi chose to retreat as many more Jedi were on their way. Despite this, Luke and the other Jedi believed the Dark Nest to be destroyed.
            Lomi Plo, however, survived, molding Alema Rar into the new Night Herald, and making increased efforts to undermine the Galactic Alliance, spending a year dispatching pirates to raid Alliance shipping between Reecee and Adumar, and flooding the populace of insectile worlds with black membrosia. This culminated in an accident that left Supreme Commander Sovv dead at the hands of membrosia-drunk insect pilots.
            The Galactic Alliance dispatched the Fifth Fleet to blockade the Utegetu Nebula. Lomi Plo had also spent her time concocting a story to convince UnuThul that absorbing Chiss into their nests would not make the Colony rife with Dark Nests, and with the worlds that the Jedi had provided the Killiks all poisoned by a nano-tech environmental defense system, the Colony quickly responded by working with the Dark Nest to destabilize the Chiss and Galactic Alliance while constructing fifteen massive Nest ships - the spark was turned into a war when Jacen Solo attacked Supply Depot Thrago; the Chiss blamed the Colony and retaliated.
            With the war against the Chiss under way, all Lomi had to do was maintain enough resources to distract the Jedi by attacking the Alliance further, and the Killiks would crush the Chiss. However, when Lomi Plo attempted to leave the Utegetu Nebula, she was engaged by the Jedi, who managed to focus long enough on her to disable eleven of the nest ships.

        <key>Tamara Ryvora</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.45.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tamara Ryvora, nicknamed "Tam," was a human female mechanic from Kuat who served as a member of Team Fireball on the Colossus, a refueling station in the Outer Rim Territories. She aspired to be a star racer, and saw repairing the derelict starship Fireball as a second chance at her goal, after having lost her first ship.
            Tamara Ryvora was the daughter of a racer. Her father's career inspired her to become a racer herself,[5] and she left her home planet of Kuat to pursue that dream. After falling on hard times[1] while working her way up the circuit, Tam came to the Colossus station on Castilon sometime before 34 ABY. She became good friends with another racer, Hype Fazon. However, the friendship ended after Fazon earned a place in the Ace Squadron, reserved for the station's most elite pilots, and moved to Doza Tower.[6] Ryvora's racing career was derailed when, in need of credits to repair her racer, she borrowed on the ship's value prior to a race, but lost the race and, consequently, her ship.[5]
            By 34 ABY, Ryvora was a member of Team Fireball, a racing team and group of mechanics led by Jarek Yeager, along with Neeku Vozo and R1-J5 "Bucket". Yeager had promised her the Fireball, an old racing ship, if she could fix it up. The arrival of Kazuda Xiono to the Colossus changed things at the team. Xiono, who was secretly a spy for the Resistance, joined Team Fireball as his cover, and almost immediately got off on the wrong foot with Ryvora when Yeager loaned him the Fireball to fly in a race that Vozo had signed him up for. Upon seeing the ship, Xiono was not impressed, and Ryvora took his criticisms as an insult of her work. She was not pleased with the used parts Xiono acquired to repair the ship as he could not afford new ones. After Xiono crashed the Fireball due to pushing it too hard, the repair of the ship had to start all over again.[2][2]
            Ryvora found Xiono's poor mechanical skills, and dubious excuses as to why, suspicious. She was further unimpressed by Xiono's apparent lack of work ethic during jobs. During one such job, for a Neimoidian named Hallion Nark, Ryvora went down to the Office of Acquisitions to drag Xiono back to the repair shop, as he had taken a long time getting a part and their client was in a hurry. Not long afterwards, there was a pirate attack, and Ryvora spent it in a shelter with Yeager and Vozo. When they returned to the hangar, they found Xiono working on the Fireball, which he claimed to have been doing for the entire attack. Ryvora was skeptical, but remained unaware that Xiono had covertly assisted the Aces in driving off the attack.[7]
            Although Ryvora continued to be frustrated by Xiono, she slowly warmed up to him. After Bucket informed her that hyperfuel had been stolen from Yeager's office, she was alarmed, telling Xiono when he asked her that more than a few drops of the stuff turned ships into flying bombs. This led Xiono to rush off to save the thief, Jace Rucklin, from the consequences of his actions.[8]
            During a series of power outages to the Colossus caused by a fuel shortage, Ryvora was put back in contact with her former friend Fazon when the members of Team Fireball spent some time at Aunt Z's Tavern. Fazon had come down there because he refused to fly supply missions involving the First Order. He saw Ryvora while he was talking to Xiono, but didn't approach her. Ryvora told Xiono that being an Ace wasn't all glamour and excitement. After Xiono hurriedly left the tavern to try and spy on the First Order shipment, Ryvora and Vozo caught up with him, and she and Xiono speculated on what the First Order wanted.[6]
            The two then had to rush after Vozo after he misinterpreted a statement from Xiono and decided to innocently ask the visitors the reasons for their arrival. Fortunately, Vozo was unharmed. Ryvora overheard Xiono telling the droid BB-8 about his desire to get into Doza Tower, and when he asked her about her friendship with Fazon, told him the details. As she began listing off the things she disliked about Fazon, Xiono tried and failed to silently warn her that Fazon had seen them as he was walking by in the hallway and was approaching from behind her. Fazon, who was somewhat regretful about how things had gone, invited Ryvora and Xiono up to Doza Tower, an invitation Xiono was happy to accept for all of them.[6]
            In the Aces Lounge, Ryvora got into an argument with Fazon about the derelict Fireball, as Fazon thought that she would never become a top-ranked racer with an old ship in that state of disrepair, while Ryvora was confident her mechanical skills were up to the challenge. Xiono took advantage of the argument to slip away to spy on the First Order, which caused Ryvora to wonder where he was when she decided to leave.[6]
            Later, she was in Aunt Z's with Vozo when he spotted Xiono on the side of Doza Tower, which astonished Ryvora, who was baffled as to how he came to be there. She and Vozo watched nervously as Xiono navigated the side of the tower while avoiding shots from some stormtroopers before making it safely inside. When Ryvora and Vozo met back up with Xiono at the repair shop, he claimed the troopers had been chasing him because he'd accidentally entered an unauthorized area. Ryvora was pleased when Xiono claimed he'd seen that Doza Tower wasn't what it was cracked up to be, and ordered him back to work as the station's power came back on.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tamara_Ryvora</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTamaraRyvora</string></dict>

        <key>Azlyn Rae</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.51.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Azlyn Rae was a Human female who, throughout her life, was trained in the ways of the Force by both the Jedi Order and the Imperial Knights. During her childhood, she was apprenticed to the Jedi Master Rasi Tuum while training to be a Jedi on Ossus. She grew close to her classmate Cade Skywalker while at the Jedi Academy, but their relationship and her training were halted when Lord Darth Krayt's Sith Order massacred the Jedi and Krayt seized control of the galaxy. Rae survived the Jedi Purge and believed both Tuum and Skywalker to be dead, prompting her to put her past behind her and become a bounty hunter. When she was discovered by the Imperial Knights, she accepted their offer to join their ranks and complete her training. Rae swore oaths of loyalty to Emperor Roan Fel and began serving his Empire-in-exile.
            Seven years after the scattering of the Jedi, Rae learned of Skywalker's survival when she was sent on an undercover mission by Fel to bring him to the Imperial fortress world of Bastion. After revealing herself to her old friend on Iego, Rae earned his trust and was brought by him to a Hidden Temple where the Jedi Order had been slowly rebuilding itself. There, she was reunited with Rasi Tuum and was ordered by her fellow Imperial Knight Marasiah Fel to accompany Skywalker on a mission to assassinate Darth Krayt. The mission led Skywalker's strike team to Had Abbadon, where they lured Krayt into a trap and managed to mortally wound him after Rae stabbed him through the chest. She herself was brought to the brink of death by Krayt's Force lightning, and Skywalker rushed her to Kiffex to be healed by his uncle Rawk. Rae accepted her impending death and resisted all efforts to heal her, but was nevertheless placed into a suit of life-preserving armor by Rawk and his wife Droo. She reacted angrily to her predicament, lashing out at Skywalker and accusing him of selfishly keeping her alive.
            After returning to Bastion, Rae was given less constricting armor by Hogrum Chalk, the Imperial Knights' master armorer, and soon after accompanied her Emperor to Agamar to conduct peace talks with the Jedi. The meeting was interrupted by Sith forces, and Rae, Tuum, and Marasiah were left behind when the Imperial Knights and Jedi evacuated the planet. Marasiah was taken by the Sith, and when Rae and Tuum's efforts to rescue her failed, they returned to Bastion to relay their news to the Emperor. Marasiah was later rescued by Master Antares Draco and stood with Rae and several other Imperial Knights as they helped the Jedi defend the Hidden Temple from attacking forces of Krayt's Empire. After the Jedi were evacuated, the allied forces of the Empire-in-exile, the Galactic Alliance, and the Jedi Order struck at Krayt's throneworld of Coruscant, and Rae joined a strike team that brought down the world's orbital defenses in advance of the attack. The war was won for the allies when Krayt was slain by Skywalker, and Rae afterward attended the funeral of Emperor Fel, who had fallen to the dark side during the battle and had been killed by Draco.
            The Human female Azlyn Rae grew up at the Jedi Academy on Ossus,[1][5] where she trained to be a Jedi as an apprentice to Master Rasi Tuum.[6] While training, she spent much of her time with her fellow apprentice Cade Skywalker,[5] and the two sometimes embarked on adventures through Ossus's jungles together.[7] They once put live gullipuds in the boots of Wolf Sazen, Skywalker's Master, and were forced to clean nerf stables for a week as punishment. Throughout their pranks and evenings spent meditating together, Rae and Skywalker grew close and developed feelings for one another, kissing on at least one occasion.[8] Their romance and Rae's training were cut short in 130 ABY with the conclusion of the Sith–Imperial War, however.[1][5] The Jedi Order and the Galactic Alliance were defeated by the Galactic Empire and the One Sith after three years of war,[9] and Rae and Tuum were at the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant when a group of Sith serving Lord Darth Krayt attacked.[1][5][9] Tuum told Rae to run, and she did, losing her master amidst the smoke and chaos and managing to flee the planet. She believed the worst and assumed Tuum to be dead.[5] Coruscant fell to the One Sith, who attacked Ossus two days later and completed their fracturing of the Jedi Order.[9] Many Jedi were scattered,[7] and Rae believed Skywalker to be dead as well.[1]
            Darth Krayt installed himself as Emperor of the galaxy and began hunting surviving Jedi.[9][10] Rae attempted to forget her past, putting memories of Skywalker behind her,[8] and began to wander the galaxy in disguise doing odd jobs and trying to make ends meet. She showed some prowess as a bounty hunter and took it up as a profession.[1][11] Rae eventually encountered an Imperial Knight,[7] who recognized her Force-sensitivity and offered to complete her training in the ways of the Force.[11] She accepted and swore oaths of loyalty to Roan Fel, Emperor of the Empire-in-exile, who had been betrayed by Darth Krayt at the end of the war and had gone into hiding. Rae promised to serve the Force through dedication to Fel and his throne.[6][11] Her training began, and her understanding of the Force expanded. She constructed her own lightsaber,[11] different from the standardized model of the order and with an orange rather than a silver blade.[1] After completing her training and becoming a full-fledged Imperial Knight, Rae earned the rank of "Master,"[6] a title reserved for the order's highest-ranking members. Her diverse training prompted the Emperor to often assign her on missions as a scout and undercover agent.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Azlyn_Rae</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAzlynRae</string></dict>
        <key>Rey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.52.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rey, a Force-sensitive human female, was a scavenger who lived on the forlorn frontier world of Jakku during the era of the New Republic. In 34 ABY, events drew her away from her homeworld and into the galactic conflict between the First Order and the Resistance. Though initially unaware of her connection to the Force, Rey's powers would manifest during the waning days of the cold war, consequently leading her on the path to becoming a Jedi under the guidance of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker.
            Born in 15 ABY, Rey spent much of her time in solitude eking out a life as a scavenger and mechanic in the Jakku desert. Abandoned by her parents at an early age, she learned to survive without a family by scavenging various materials from the battlefield of the last conflict in the Galactic Civil War, all the while honing her skills as a warrior and pilot. Her solitary life was interrupted, however, when the hunt for Skywalker brought the First Order and the Resistance to Jakku. Compelled to help the Resistance, Rey befriended the astromech droid BB-8 and a renegade stormtrooper named Finn, as well as the war veterans Han Solo and Chewbacca. She also found a nemesis in Kylo Ren, the son of Han Solo who fell to the dark side of the Force and became a champion of the First Order.
            Following the Battle of Starkiller Base, Rey tracked Skywalker to Ahch-To—a planet located in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy. Though she hoped to rediscover a living legend, as well as a mentor who could help her control her growing powers, Rey found an embittered hermit determined to remain in exile after failing to prevent his nephew Ren's fall from the light side of the Force. Faced with a reluctant teacher whose final goal was to die as the last of the Jedi Order, Rey gradually turned to Ren as the galaxy's last hope. The insight she gained into Ren through their Force-bond convinced Rey that there was still good within the former Ben Solo. Following her short and unconventional apprenticeship under Skywalker, Rey confronted Ren in person, believing he could be turned to the light with her help. Yet despite her faith in Solo, who indeed betrayed and killed his master, Supreme Leader Snoke, Ren chose to remain on the dark path. After rejecting Ren's offer to rule the galaxy together, Rey rescued the remnants of the Resistance on Crait, thereby preventing the organization's complete annihilation at the hands of the newly anointed Supreme Leader Kylo Ren. After Skywalker passed away, Rey became the last Jedi and continued her training in the Jedi arts by using the ancient texts that she acquired on Ahch-To.
            In 1 BBY, during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire and more than a decade before Rey's birth, her voice was heard by Padawan Ezra Bridger during his brief visit to the world between worlds—a place that existed beyond time and space.[7] Rey was born in 15 ABY, eleven years after the Battle of Endor.[2] At a young age, her family left her on Jakku, a desert planet in the Western Reaches, for reasons unknown to her. She believed it was a mistake and that they would one day return to bring her home[5] as she recalled a male voice calling her sweetheart and promising to return for her.[8] She later admitted to herself that her parents had sold her to Jakku's economy for drinking money.[6]
            Throughout her life on Jakku, she would sometimes see off-worlders in Niima Outpost, the chief trade outpost on the planet, who she thought might have arrived on Jakku accidentally, unaware of the harsh realities of the desert world. Rey wondered if she was left behind under similar circumstances, if her family had come to Jakku by accident and she was left behind as a result of their misfortune.[9] Whatever the reasons were, she held out hope that her family would return for her one day, though she began to realize that they would never come back. She proved unwilling to admit this even to herself for a long time.[5]
            In order to survive on Jakku, Rey became a scavenger in the employ of Unkar Plutt, trawling through the junk fields of the Starship Graveyard which was littered with the remains of starships and other military technology[5] from the Battle of Jakku. At first, she worked for other scavengers, bringing them the loot she found in crashed New Republic and Galactic Empire vessels that were downed during the battle. She heard local stories about what happened during the battle: that it was the last stand of the once-powerful Empire during the Galactic Civil War, that the Empire locked onto Republic ships during the fighting and dragged them down to the surface together, and more. The battle had left the ships trapped in the sand in varying conditions, and finding working parts became essential in order to earn food portions, the only thing that was up for trade in Niima Outpost. The trades were made by Plutt, who traded leftover Republic and Imperial rations in exchange for whatever Rey and other scavengers were able to recover. Rey learned that parts that could be repurposed were the most important; anything that could not be put into another ship was worthless to Plutt.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRey</string></dict>

            A Force-sensitive Human female, Clee Rhara was a contemporary of Qui-Gon Jinn and Tahl, receiving training in the ways of the Force at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. After years of training as a Guardian and specializing as an ace in the Jedi Starfighter Corps, Clee Rhara attained the rank of Jedi Master.[1]
            Selecting the young Initiate Garen Muln as her Padawan, Rhara worked with the Starfighter Corps to establish a piloting academy on Centax-2, one of Coruscant's moons. While Rhara worked to see the academy open, many members of the Galactic Senate opposed funding for the Starfighter Corps' academy. Rumors were propagated in the Senate that Rhara had sabotaged the project herself in order to prompt further funding. The Order saw the funding bill come to a vote where it was undermined through the secret machinations of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. The facility became too expensive to maintain and was eventually shut down.[1]
            Despite the project's failure, Rhara and Muln were kept busy with assignments from the Jedi High Council. Training Muln to knighthood, the pair continued to work with each other on missions. In 25 BBY, Rhara and Muln accompanied Master Siri Tachi and her Padawan Ferus Olin to the Xanlanner system on an assignment. En route, the Jedi received a distress signal from Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on TY44. They picked up Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker on Vanqor, where they had crash-landed. The team then traveled to Typha-Dor to help them thwart the Vanqor invasion.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clee_Rhara</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemCleeRhara</string></dict>
        <key>Rebb</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.55.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rebb was a female human who was on the planet Mon Cala along with Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr and five other acolytes of Barr's one year into the reign of the Galactic Empire. Darth Vader and three Inquisitors went to Mon Cala in search of Barr and found them as they vacated their refuge. They were chased to Bel City where she and Stell stayed to hold off Vader and the Inquisitors.
            Shortly after the Clone Wars, Rebb and Stell watched from their home as the Galactic Empire moved in to occupy their city. They condemned the Empire and decided that they would not live under such conditions. Eventually, they met Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr, who stylized himself as a Jedi Master, in a cantina and recruited them into his group of acolytes.[2]
            By 18 BBY, Barr and his acolytes were based in a cave refuge on Mon Cala where Barr served as a secret advisor to King of Mon Cala Lee-Char. During Barr's tenure as advisor, he guided King Lee-Char in trade negotiations with Imperial Ambassador Telvar. The techniques used in the negotiations caught the attention of Emperor Darth Sidious, who sent his Sith apprentice Darth Vader, three inquisitors, a squad of Purge Troopers to Mon Cala, and Moff Wilhuff Tarkin in his flagship, the Sovereign.[3]
            Upon the arrival of Vader and the Inquisitors, Telvar was assassinated, and in response, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin dispatched Major Rantu and his forces down to Mon Cala, resulting in a planet-wide war. When Lee-Char informed Barr about Vader's presence, he recognized that it was the former Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.[3] After informing the group, including Rebb, that Skywalker—the Chosen One who was believed by some to bring balance to the Force—was fighting on Mon Cala, Barr explained to them how the Jedi Order onced believed in him, and how he betrayed and destroyed them. Rebb wanted to avenge the Jedi and kill Vader, but Barr had other ideas for the time being.[1]
            In the aftermath of the Battle of Dac City, Barr was informed by Lee-Char that Vader discovered their hideout and was likely coming for them. Barr immediately ordered his acolytes to evacuate and ordered his droid, Endee, to self-destruct. Upon leaving the refuge, they encountered Vader and his Inquisitors in an Imperial submarine and immediately scattered, heading towards the nearby Bel City. One of the acolytes, however, Nipaltoo, vectored towards Vader's submarine and attacked, only to have his helmet crushed by the Sith Lord and killed. They continued to flee when another acolyte, Orvek, attacked the submarine and perished in the attempt. The remaining group reached Bel City, where Rebb decided that she should try to slow them down. She was joined by Stell.[2]
            Rebb was a human female with black hair and fair skin, and strongly opposed the Empire when they occupied her city. She was able to convince Stell to join her in her efforts against the Empire and undoubtedly followed Barr when he offered the opportunity to find purpose.[2] When Darth Vader arrived on Mon Cala, Rebb was keen to avenge Barr's fallen brethren.[1] When they were pursued by Vader to Bel City, Rebb then took the opportunity to fight them and stayed behind.[2]
            Rebb first appeared in the canon 2018 comic Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 14: Burning Seas, Part II written by Charles Soule and pencilled by Giuseppe Camuncoli.[1] Although Rebb's fate is left ambiguous, a flashback occurred subsequent to her final appearance. This was similar to flashbacks that occurred after the deaths of other acolytes.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rebb</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRebb</string></dict>
        <key>Sosha Soruna</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.56.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sosha Soruna was a human female monarch who ruled as Queen of the Royal House of Naboo during the Age of the Galactic Empire. In accordance with the posthumous instructions of the late Emperor Palpatine, Naboo and several other key planets were targeted for annihilation under Operation: Cinder. Hoping to prevent the devastation that the Imperial Military would unleash on the Naboo homeworld, Queen Soruna joined forces with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, thereby committing Naboo to the Rebel cause in the waning months of the Galactic Civil War.
            Sosha Soruna earned a fighter pilot certification a year before her election as Queen of Naboo.[2] In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor, where the Alliance to Restore the Republic defeated the authoritarian Galactic Empire, Queen Soruna—whose world had been a member of the democratic government that preceded the Empire—became a potential ally for Mon Mothma, Chancellor of the Alliance. Some twenty days after Endor, Soruna received a visit from Leia Organa, princess of the destroyed planet Alderaan, who acted as the Alliance envoy to Naboo.[1]
            During Organa's visit, it transpired that the Empire was using an array of satellites to disrupt the climate of Naboo and provoke typhoons that would render the planet uninhabitable. Although Naboo had been demilitarized years earlier, Queen Soruna still had access to a few remaining N-1 starfighters, which she made available to Organa and her aide, the Alliance pilot Shara Bey. In addition to providing crafts that could destroy the Empire's satellites, the queen decided to get involved in the dogfight herself, against the advice of her head of security, Captain Korro. Soruna, Organa and Bey formed a temporary flight group. While Shara Bey was trying to buy time, destroying TIE fighters that came out of an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, the Queen of Naboo and the Princess of Alderaan set off to locate and destroy the satellites. Together, Soruna and Organa destroyed at least nine satellites, with the queen blowing up the last of them. However, the Star Destroyer started moving toward the improvised flight group, whose three fighters could not match the new threat. Fortunately for them, an Alliance flotilla led by General Lando Calrissian came out of hyperspace at the eleventh hour, engaging the Imperial ships and allowing Soruna, Organa and Bey to disengage.[2]
            Sosha Soruna had black hair, brown eyes, and light skin. As a queen, she usually wore a headdress, makeup and a scar of remembrance.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sosha_Soruna</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSoshaSoruna</string></dict>

            They were both extremely skilled pilots, and they were a great acquisition to the Rebellion. Around 2 ABY, she and Ghia met the newly joined smuggler Han Solo and they fell both in love with the charming ace. Therefore, they were devastated when they heard that Solo was captured by the Empire and delivered to Jabba the Hutt by Boba Fett. Determined to rescue Solo, they stole a snowspeeder and abandoned the Rebellion to rescue him from Jabba, but were captured and enslaved. During their enslavement they were forced to wear skimpy slave outfits very similar to Princess Leia's. They were also forced to feed and massage him. When Jabba found out that she and her sister were Rebel pilots, he let them fight in his "Demolition" games. Now that they were fighting for the Hutt, Jabba appointed Oola as his personal masseuse.
            During these Demolition Games, it is unknown what the fate of the twins were. Records were lost along with Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire. It is rumored that either the two were freed with the help of Princess Leia Organa disguised as Boushh or alternatively doomed to remain as slaves.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tia_(pilot)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTia</string></dict>

Taneel was also present in a meeting with members of the Delegation of 2,000.
            A human female,[2] Terr Taneel was a senator in the Galactic Republic[3] during the conflict against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, known as the Clone Wars who represented Senex.[1] After Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine's capture at the Battle of Coruscant, she was amongst the crowd who greeted the Chancellor when he was returned from Separatist capture by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. Taneel was also present at the landing bay when Skywalker delivered Chancellor Palpatine safely back to the Galactic Senate.

        <key>Ryoo Thule</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.60.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ryoo Thule was a Human female from Naboo. She was the mother of Jobal Naberrie, the maternal grandmother of Sola Naberrie and Padmé Amidala, and the great-grandmother of Ryoo and Pooja Naberrie, Luke Skywalker, and Leia Organa.
            She was murdered by Inquisitor Malorum at Varykino in 18 BBY after the latter threateningly insisted to get more details about Amidala's pregnancy and death.
            Ryoo Thule was a female Human from the Mid Rim planet of Naboo. She had a sister and was married to an unidentified man who died many years before the end of the Galactic Republic.[1] From their marriage was born a daughter, Jobal, who had a happy childhood and received a good education.[2]
            Thule was good friends with another Naboo woman named Winama Naberrie. The two secretly plotted to marry off their children, Jobal and Ruwee, and were the first to be surprised when they both actually fell in love.[1] The young couple got married in 51 BBY.[3] Winama died in 33 BBY, a year before the Battle of Naboo.[4]
            Thule's great-granddaughter, Ryoo Naberrie, was named after her. The name was also shared by a blue and yellow flower that grew near the city of Keren.[2]
            In 19 BBY, Thule was the overseer of the funeral of her granddaughter Padmé Amidala, as was the custom on Naboo. Feeling great grief at her beloved grandchild's passing, Thule spent the next six months mourning at Translucence Cove in Varykino.[1]
            After all these months, Thule finally decided that it was time to return to Theed, as she knew that Amidala would not have wanted her to live in seclusion for the rest of her life. However, Thule had been having a strange feeling ever since she woke up, but tried to comfort herself by thinking that she was only anxious to let go of her grief. It was the only possible explanation why her heart fluttered, or why Amidala felt so especially close to her that morning.[1]
            Thule suddenly realized she was not alone in the retreat. A man named Malorum, one of the Empire's Inquisitors, had come to interrogate Thule about Amidala and her mysterious pregnancy. As soon as Thule saw his eyes, she understood what she had been feeling all morning. She knew she was going to die. Eventually, Malorum proved her right. Her hesitation and defiance to his questions led him to deduce that Amidala's offspring had not died. The Inquisitor then proceeded to kill Thule. A short while later, Ferus Olin and Trever Flume arrived in turn at Varykino. With her dying breath, Thule begged Olin to protect her granddaughter's memory.[1]
            Malorum's knowledge of the existence of the Skywalker twins died with him during a lightsaber duel with Olin. He fell to his death inside the Theed power generator when he tried to retrieve his lightsaber that was tumbling down the pit. Olin had watched him struggle in the Force, desperately trying to hold onto his lightsaber, knowing that if he lost it he would be disgraced and would never become a Sith.[1]
            Ryoo Thule was a small and sturdy female Human with white hair and dark gray eyes dusted with gold. She had a great sense of family and cared deeply for her relatives. While walking down to Varykino's lake, she could feel the presence of her lost ones, such as her husband and her recently deceased grandchild Padmé Amidala. Thule was devastated when Amidala—to whom she had felt closer than any of her other granddaughters—mysteriously died, shortly after the end of the Clone Wars. The tragedy led Thule to live in isolation for six months.[1]
            Thule also seemed to have a certain sense of precognition. On the day of her death, she woke up before dawn with the unsettling feeling that something was wrong, and as soon as she saw Malorum, she knew the Inquisitor would eventually kill her.[1]
            When Malorum confronted Thule, he felt that the elderly woman was full of love, strength, and courage. Even though she was deeply afraid of him and already knew what he would do to her, Thule stood up to the Inquisitor and refused to tell him what he wanted to know out of love and loyalty to Amidala.[1]
            The character of Ryoo Thule was first mentioned in the eightieth issue of The Official Star Wars Fact File, published in 2003.[2] She later made her first appearance in Jude Watson's young reader novel The Last of the Jedi: Death on Naboo, released in April 2006.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ryoo_Thule</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRyooThule</string></dict>
        <key>Etain Tur-Mukan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.61.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Etain Tur-Mukan was a female Human Jedi Knight and General who lived during the Clone Wars. She was the Padawan of Jedi Master Kast Fulier. They both were assigned to Qiilura some time after the First Battle of Geonosis to collect vital information about the Trade Federation and Separatist infrastructure on the planet. It was during this assignment that she would first encounter the clone commandos of Omega Squad, with whom she would later become increasingly involved.
            After finishing her mission on Qiilura, Etain completed her Jedi Trials under Arligan Zey and became a full Jedi Knight. She served in multiple command positions throughout the Clone Wars, and completed assignments with both Omega Squad, Delta Squad and other clone units on Coruscant, Kashyyyk and elsewhere. During one of these missions she would break the Jedi Code's rule of attachment by falling in love with Darman, RC-1136, a clone commando in Omega Squad, and becoming pregnant with his child, Venku Skirata. The two would later marry in the traditional Mandalorian way shortly before her death in 19 BBY.
            Etain was killed shortly after the issue of Order 66 in the aftermath of Operation: Knightfall at a security checkpoint at Shinarcan Bridge, Coruscant near the Jedi Temple. Etain had recently returned from Kashyyyk and was attempting to rejoin the rest of Clan Skirata and escape off-planet. On the way to the rendezvous, Etain had to pass through a security checkpoint on Shinarcan Bridge when several Padawans were discovered in the crowd. A melee ensued as the Padawans tried to escape, and Etain instinctively jumped between a clone trooper and a panicking Jedi Padawan, receiving the downward arc of the blow meant for the clone, severing her spine and killing her nearly instantaneously, only meters from her loved ones.
            Taken from her parents at a young age after being discovered to be Force-sensitive, Etain Tur-Mukan was trained in the ways of the Force at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. After completing her education at the Temple's academy, Tur-Mukan was selected as Padawan by the Jedi Master Kast Fulier. Together, the Master-Padawan pair accepted missions from the Jedi High Council and traveled the galaxy together.
            Before the breakout of the Clone Wars, Tur-Mukan and her Master, Kast Fulier, were entrusted with covertly monitoring and gathering intelligence of suspected Separatist activity within the Trade Federation Barq export operation on the backwater planet of Qiilura. They worked for several weeks in deep cover, gathering information on a number of Separatist facilities around the planet's capital, Imbraani, including Dr. Ovolot Qail Uthan's biological research facility and the Separatist communication facility near Teklet. Fulier, although greatly skilled, was known for his sympathetic and just nature, oftentimes drawing unwanted attention to the pair while undercover. Upon witnessing how the Neimoidians and the Mandalorian mercenary Ghez Hokan exploited and oppressed the local population, Fulier could not bring himself to resist intervening. After defending a few of the locals against one of Hokan's thugs, the same locals would later reveal his whereabouts to Ghez Hokan for little more than the price of a bottle of Urrqal, forcing Tur-Mukan to escape on her own with the building schematics they had recovered. Fulier was eventually captured and executed by Hokan, who then took Fulier's lightsaber for his own use.
            For the next few weeks Tur-Mukan managed to survive on her own, hiding in the countryside outside Imbraani. Still in possession of the plans, she was desperately looking for a way to either escape the hostile world or at least transmit what she and Fulier had gathered off-planet. Right after she had narrowly escaped a drunk Weequay thug, she met with a Gurlanin, a shapeshifter species, by the name of Jinart, whom at that time was under the guise of an old woman. Jinart helped Tur-Mukan by influencing a barq farmer named Birhan in order to get her shelter at his farm, at least for the time being.
            When Omega Squad landed on the planet, it was also Jinart who scouted out the whereabouts of the commandos and led Tur-Mukan to meet RC-1136. When she first felt him in the Force, she was confused to sense a child rather than a man. When she finally met Darman, she mistook him for Hokan, and attempted to kill him. After being disarmed, she realized that it was not, in fact, Hokan. From Darman, Tur-Mukan first learned of the Grand Army of the Republic, as well as the fact that Jedi had been made commanders and generals in charge of leading the army. Given her self-critical nature, feeling she had been a disappointment to the Jedi, Tur-Mukan refused to take up on that role, going so far as to order Darman to disobey her if she gave an order that made no logical sense. Nevertheless, she agreed to join Omega Squad in their mission to avert the danger rooting in Dr. Uthan's research of a nanovirus lethal to clones and take the scientist prisoner.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Etain_Tur-Mukan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemEtainTurMukan</string></dict>

She, like the majority of her classmates and the faculty of the Academy, was surprised and displeased by the arrival of Thrawn, an alien from the Unknown Regions who defied the xenophobia running rampant throughout the Galactic Empire, and so she conspired with Spenc Orbar and several other classmates to get rid of him. First, she and Orbar invited Thrawn to the metallurgy lab to gamble, an activity strictly forbidden by the Academy, in an effort to get him caught doing so. This attempt failed when Thrawn brandished a lieutenant's plaque Commandant Deenlark, the president of the Academy, had given him in order to hasten his graduation. When an instructor Orbar had discreetly called for burst in, he saw the plaque and had no choice but to leave them to their activities, as lieutenants were allowed in the metallurgy lab. Turuy, Orbar, and their fellow conspirators resorted to physically attacking Thrawn, but thanks to intervention from Eli Vanto, Thrawn's aide, this attempt also failed. Thrawn and Vanto later reported the attack to Commandant Deenlark, who was surprised when Thrawn, instead of demanding that his assailants be punished, recommended that they be transferred to Skystrike Academy, as he had noted while under attack from them that they had displayed tremendous aptitude as fighter pilots. Deenlark granted Thrawn's request, and in a stroke of genius on Thrawn's part, Turuy and Orbar's co-conspirators disappeared without a trace, leaving them paranoid and unsure of their fate.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rosita_Turuy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRositaTuruy</string></dict>
        <key>Lilit Twoseas</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.63.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lilit Twoseas was a female Human Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Most notably, Twoseas was the master of the famed Jedi K'Kruhk, one of the few Jedi to escape the Great Jedi Purge, Galactic Civil War, and the rise of the One Sith in 137 ABY.
            While Lilit Twoseas' early life is ambiguous, it is most likely that she was discovered to be Force-sensitive by doctors on her homeworld, who then would have notified the Jedi Temple of their discovery. Dispatching Jedi to bring her to Coruscant, she would have entered into the academy there as an Initiate. After graduating from the academy, Twoseas was chosen as a Padawan by a Jedi Master and, after years of one-on-one study, passed her Trials of Knighthood and elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight.[1]
            A skilled swordsman and an adept in the Force, Twoseas undertook specialized study in the Force on her own time. Eventually Twoseas came across the young Whiphid Initiate K'Kruhk and selected him to be her own Padawan. Following many years of training the boy, Twoseas and her student volunteered to accompany the Master of the Order, Mace Windu, on a perilous journey to the Yinchorri system to quell the pan-galactic uprising plaguing the region. The Jedi separated into three teams, with Twoseas joining Jedi High Councilors Micah Giiett and Plo Koon to located the rumored command center on the planet Yibikkoror. When their ship came under fire, the Jedi crash-landed on a lone floating city and began to spread out in search of the command center. Deducing that it was not located on Yibikkoror, the Jedi called for Master Eeth Koth's team to rescue them, as they came under siege by Yinchorri warriors.[1]
            Safely aboard Koth's shuttle, the Jedi team headed to Yinchorr to assist Master Windu's team. On the ground, Twoseas and her Padawan engaged the enemy, fighting their way to their besieged comrades. As they regrouped and headed back to their escape shuttle, K'Kruhk was surrounded by Yinchorri and would have soon been overwhelmed. Unable to standby and do nothing, Twoseas dove into the conflict and jumped in front of a blade meant for the Whiphid's heart. The blade pierced her shoulder, as a second impaled her chest. Picking up her blood-covered form, K'Kruhk and the other Jedi fled to the ship and departed the world.[1]
            After the Republic Navy destroyed the control center and silenced the rebels, the Jedi returned with their fallen comrades to the Temple of Coruscant. Escorting Twoseas' body on a hover-gurney, K'Kruhk took his deceased Master into the Temple where it would lie in state until being cremated on the Temple's pyre.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lilit_Twoseas</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLilitTwoseas</string></dict>

Trained at the academy there, Qiyn went on to be selected as a Padawan by a Jedi Master. Trained in the fifth form of lightsaber combat, Qiyn was one of many students to master the form. After years of study and crafting a green-bladed lightsaber, Qiyn passed her Trials of Knighthood and was made a Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. Continuing her studies independently, Qiyn selected to walk the path of the Jedi Consular, excelling as a Diplomat for the Council of Reconciliation.[2]
            While traveling the galaxy on behalf of the Order Qiyn selected the Human Bairdon Jace as her Padawan.[2][3] During the height of the Separatist Crisis, Jedi Qiyn and Padawan Jace were stationed outside the Galactic Senate Rotunda on the evening of the vote on the Military Creation Act. After an affirmative vote, both Qiyn and Jace joined Master of the Order Mace Windu's massive strike team in flying to the world of Geonosis to rescue capture Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padmé Amidala. Storming the Petranaki arena, Qiyn and Jace fought valiantly against the droid army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems; Qiyn employed her mastery of Form V to decimate her opponents.[4] She perished during the battle, while her Padawan was able to survive.[1]

She was four years old and the youngest member of a branch of the Fardi clan, a wealthy smuggler family on Thabeska. Hedala was Force-sensitive, and able to sense danger from afar. While the Togruta former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano was working as a mechanic and courier pilot for the Fardis, she befriended Hedala. Although most people could not distinguish between the various female cousins of Hedala's branch of the Fardi clan, everyone remembered Hedala. Her cousin Chenna joked that this meant that Hedala would not be successful in a life of crime. Hedala's Force talents also made her extremely good at many of the games she played with her cousins, including a throwing game. Her cousins became so used to it that they didn't find anything unusual about her skill.[1]
            Two months before the one-year anniversary of Palpatine's ascension as Emperor, Ahsoka was working on one of the Fardis' droids when she saw several of the youngest Fardi cousins, including Hedala, playing in the shipyard, which they weren't allowed to do. Ahsoka was about to shoo them away when a stack of crates the children were playing on began to fall, so she used the Force to save the children's lives. The other children did not realize what had happened, but Ahsoka saw Hedala, who was too young to be included in the game, watching with a fascinated look on her face. Ahsoka was certain that Hedala was the only one who had seen and understood what she had done, and three days later, she saw Hedala use telekinesis to move a small stone.[1]
            Shortly after the Empire Day festivities, when Ahsoka had left Thabeska in an attempt to avoid Imperial attention, Hedala sensed a "shadow" in the Force, which turned out to be the Inquisitor known as the Sixth Brother. The Sixth Brother had come to Thabeska after receiving reports of a Force-sensitive on the planet, but he was not strong enough in the Force to track it to its source, resulting in him leaving. Hedala later confided in Ahsoka, who advised her to stay away from the "shadow" should she sense it again. Ahsoka later told Hedala's uncle Fardi to safeguard the youngest of the clan because she was "special". Hedala was saddened by Ahsoka's departure.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hedala_Fardi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemHedalaFardi</string></dict>
        <key>Tanith Shire</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.67.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tanith Shire was a Human female from the planet Ophideraan. As a young woman, she and her father crashed their ship on Ophideraan, and her people were enslaved by the Serpent Masters, a scavenger group who forced them to maintain the Great Well, their base of operation. Due to the Serpent Masters' mastery over the world's flying serpents, Shire and her people were unable to escape. However, Shire convinced the Serpent Masters' leader, Supreme Serpent Master Tyrann to let her leave Ophideraan to send salvage their way.
            As an agent for the Serpent Masters, Shire worked as a supply tug operator at the starship yards of Fondor. She was able to reprogram drone barges to crash-land on Ophideraan, supplying her masters with a regular supply of salvage. During her work, Shire came into contact with the Rebel spy, Luke Skywalker who was at the shipyards to gather intelligence on the Executor, which was being constructed there. Shire rescued Skywalker from an ambush by Darth Vader and helped him escape Fondor in one of her reprogrammed drone barges. After crash-landing on Ophideraan, Shire and Skywalker teamed up to defeat Tyrann and the Serpent Masters, freeing her people. Although Shire had fallen in love with Skywalker during their adventures, and tried to convince him to stay with her, Skywalker's devotion to the Rebellion would not let him abandon his cause and the two parted ways.
            Several years before the Battle of Yavin, Tanith and her father, Josen Shire, were forced to crash-land their ship on the desert world of Ophideraan. On Ophideraan, Tanith, Josen and the people aboard their shuttle were enslaved by the Serpent Masters, and put to work maintaining the Great Well, the base of operations for the scavengers. Shire and her people were confined to the slave levels at the bottom of the well with no way to escape except by riding flying beasts that could only be controlled by the Serpent Masters. The Supreme Serpent Master, Tyrann, became attracted to Tanith, and the girl used this to her advantage. She persuaded Tyrann to allow her to leave Ophideraan, though on the condition that she supplied his people with wrecks to salvage. Tanith hoped that if she served the Serpent Masters loyally, she would eventually be able to buy her people's freedom.[4] Around 0 ABY, Tanith was present on the planet Fondor being employed as a supply tug operator. She periodically sent drone barges and supply ships programmed to crash on Ophideraan's surface for the Serpent Masters to loot. She explained away the loss of these vessels with stories of system malfunctions.[5][4]
            While working at the Fondor Shipyards, Shire was responsible for transporting raw materials and workers in her supply tug to the worksite of the Executor. During one of her supply runs, she was assigned to bring one of the droid maintenance workers and his droids to the worksite. As she went to meet up with the new worker, she met Luke Skywalker, an undercover Rebel spy. Unknown to Shire, Skywalker was attempting to gather data on the Empire's new warship and was using his droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO to pose as a droid maintenance worker. Upon seeing Skywalker, Shire was immediately infatuated, and in her direct manner, she told the young man that she found him attractive. Luke was shocked by Shire's directness, but he warded off her flirtations despite her obvious interest in him. On the flight to the Executor Shire openly discussed the possibility that Skywalker might be a spy and questioned him on his relationships, surmising that his tentativeness in returning her affections might be due to having recently been rejected by another woman. Skywalker did not deny any of her conclusions and left her ship flustered by her aggressiveness. As he departed for the worksite, Shire offered her supply tug as his return trip to Fondor.[5]
            However, when the work day ended, Skywalker was nowhere to be seen. After asking around, she learned that the young man had been stuck with a last minute job assigned by Admiral Amise Griff. Shire waited for Skywalker at the Fondor shipyard worker's compound and watched as he arrived in the Admiral's personal starship. She propositioned Skywalker again, asking him to spend some time with her, but he refused, claiming that he had another engagement to attend to. Shire, unbelieving of the young man's excuse, followed him as he departed the worker's compound with his two droids. Shire followed as he descended into the planet's underground steam tubes, but in her pursuit, she also noticed a large force of Imperial stormtroopers entering the tunnels. As she attempted to catch up to Skywalker to warn him, she encountered R2-D2 and C-3PO, who had been switched off and left in one of the steam tubes. She switched them both back on and learned that Skywalker had been lured into a trap orchestrated by Darth Vader. With Skywalker's droids at her side, she raced to rescue the young Rebel, but a large Imperial force was present between her and Skywalker. Needing a diversion to help him escape, Shire ordered R2-D2 to plug into a terminal which controlled the steam flow system. Despite 3PO's protests over the danger, Shire forced the astromech droid to cause a back up in the steam flow, flooding the tunnels with fog. With Shire's diversion, Skywalker was able to overpower a stormtrooper and steal his armor, using it to escape discretely and meet up with Shire. Supremely thankful for her help, Skywalker joined Shire in fleeing the tunnels.

Born without Force-sensitivity, she was nevertheless taught fighting skills by both Jedi and the Yuuzhan Vong, who also taught her basic Shaper skills. When the Sith-Imperial War commenced, Zonama Sekot fled into hyperspace. Accordingly, it was a while before its inhabitants re-established contact with the rest of the galaxy. After learning about the Massacre at Ossus, Ti and several others traveled to Wayland to uncover proof that the Ossus Project was sabotaged. There, she discovered that someone had created terrible mutations from the vongspawned creatures there and also discovered a way to bring some of them back to their normal form. In 137 ABY, she met Jariah Syn and saved him from the local wildlife. When awakened, Syn tried to attack Ti before she could explain her presence on the planet and tell Syn where his friends had been taken.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fionah_Ti</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemFionahTi</string></dict>

        <key>Lyra Erso</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.71.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lyra Erso was the human female wife of the scientist Galen Erso. During the Clone Wars, Galen was arrested while researching Kyber crystals on Vallt and charged with espionage by Confederate loyalists. While in confinement, Lyra gave birth to their daughter, Jyn. The three were rescued by Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic, an old friend of her husband and a member of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine's top secret Death Star project.
            Krennic convinced Galen to continue his study in Kyber crystals, and secretly used Galen's research in order to weaponize the crystals for use in the Death Star. Over the course of several years, Lyra became suspicious of Krennic's motivations for saving her family, and was able to persuade Galen to abandon his research into Kyber crystals and flee Coruscant for Lah'mu with the help of Saw Gerrera. Four years later, Krennic and a squad of death troopers found the Erso family, and attempted to bring them all back to Coruscant. Lyra was killed by a death trooper when she threatened Krennic with a blaster.
            Years later, Jyn became part of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and stole plans to the Death Star battle station, Krennic's achievement. With Rogue One's sacrifice, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin ordered the Death Star to fire at Scarif, wiping out Rogue One and all Imperial forces present, including Krennic, proving Lyra's final words correct.
            Lyra Erso was born on Aria Prime in 47 BBY. She grew up as an only child and studied at the University of Rudrig in 29 BBY. Lyra's mother had to take out loans to fund her education, which Lyra later paid back from a job providing HoloNet footage.[1] As a child, Lyra became friends with Nari Sable.[3]
            Lyra met Galen Erso at the age of 21, when she worked as a guide for Galen's team of scientists studying crystals on the planet Espinar. Lyra headed a survey team that discovered an intricate cave system and found crystals unique to the planet. Her expert knowledge of the cave system led to her being picked by Galen as his guide while he studied the crystals. While working together, Galen and Lyra fell in love and were married six months later on the planet Coruscant.[3]
            Three years after marrying Galen, as the Clone Wars began, Lyra worked as Galen's lab assistant during their time researching Kyber crystals on the planet Vallt for Zerpen Industries. Lyra had an ear for mimicry, and was able to communicate with the local Valltii in their native language better than her husband.[3]
            It was just before coming to Vallt, that Lyra became pregnant with her and Galen's daughter, Jyn. In 22 BBY, a coup occurred on the planet with the help of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The previous ruler, King Chai, was killed and replaced by Marshal Phara, a Separatist ally. Galen and Lyra were caught while trying to escape Vallt, and Galen was arrested for espionage against the Confederacy.[3]
            While Galen was detained by the Vallti, Lyra was being held in the northern wing of the Keep in Tambolor. Jyn was born during this time in captivity; Galen was able to be present during the birth, even though he was being investigated for spying for the Galactic Republic.[3]
            Six months after the birth of Jyn, the Erso family was rescued from confinement by Orson Krennic as part of a prisoner exchange program. Galen, Lyra, and Jyn were exchanged for Nan Pakota and Urshe Torr, two prominent Separatist scientists. After the exchange, Krennic ordered the Keep to be destroyed by Republic forces, resulting in the death of Galen and Lyra's research partners and friends, as well as many inhabitants of the planet.[3]
            In 18 BBY, Krennic offered her a job surveying a cave system on the planet Alpinn. At first she was skeptical of his offer, correctly assuming that he just wanted her out of the way. In the end, however she accepted the offer at Galen's encouragement, bringing Jyn along for the three-month survey.[3]
            During their time on Alpinn, Lyra and Jyn stayed at the Alpinn archaeology camp with Lyra's old friend Sable, the pilot Has Obitt, and other researchers.[3]
            The caves turned out not to be kybers, but ranite, a related crystal.[3]
            On the way back to Coruscant, Lyra, Jyn, Nari, and Has stopped in orbit of Samovar and Wadi Raffa, two planets being mercilessly stripped of resources useful to the Empire. Lyra was greatly unsettled and angry at the destructive mining operation, taking Krennic to task for the environmental devastation.[3]
            The Erso family hid from Imperial forces for four years on the Outer Rim planet Lah'mu. While on the planet, the Ersos lead a self-sustaining life by growing crops and filtering water on their large homestead, procured for them by Saw Gerrera. Paranoid of being found by Krennic, the family created an elaborate plan to hide from Krennic, which included the building of an underground bunker beneath a small cave on their property. Krennic and a cadre of death troopers finally found the Erso family and confronted them. Lyra instructed Jyn to escape, but not before giving her a pendant of a Kyber crystal fragment, which she had taken from Galen's research materials as they escaped Coruscant.[1] She then fled and her husband Galen told Krennic that she had passed away during their time on Lah'mu. To Galen's dismay, however, Lyra returned and confronted Krennic and his troopers, threatening him with a blaster. Lyra was shot and killed by a trooper, causing her to shoot Krennic in his left shoulder postmortem, injuring him.[2] Lyra's body was taken aboard Krennic's shuttle on a gurney on the Director's orders. Krennic informed Galen that they would have a funeral for Lyra as soon they reached Corscuant and would be honored.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lyra_Erso</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLyraErso</string></dict>
        <key>Esmelle</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.72.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Esmelle was a human[2] female who lived on the planet Akiva during the Galactic Civil War. Her sister, Norra, was a pilot for the Alliance to Restore the Republic; during Norra's absence, Esmelle and her wife Shirene watched over Norra's son, Temmin. Esmelle had pale skin, and, like her sister, silver hair. Unlike her sister and nephew, Esmelle was reluctant to get involved in the Galactic Civil War.
            Esmelle was the older sister of the Rebel Alliance and New Republic starfighter pilot Norra Wexley and the aunt of Temmin Wexley,[1] who later also became a pilot in the New Republic Starfighter Corps and the Resistance.[3] Esmelle was a rebellious adolescent who led a gang of hooligans in the Akivan city of Myrra when Norra was born. She had a same-sex relationship with another human woman named Shirene. The couple lived at a house on Orchard Hill.[1]
            When Temmin was twelve years old, Esmelle and Shirene became his guardian after her younger sister Norra when to search for her husband Brentin Lore Wexley, who had been imprisoned by the Galactic Empire. Temmin proved to be a clever but strong-willed and rebellious adolescent for Esmelle and her wife to handle. By the time that he was fourteen, Temmin had moved back to his family home which he turned into a junk shop. Despite moving out, Temmin still kept in touch with Esmelle and Shirene. He bought the couple groceries and repaired their flood-pump.[1]
            In the months following the Battle of Endor, Norra visited her sister Esmelle in an effort to reunite with her son Temmin. After learning that Temmin had moved out, she met up with Temmin only to be separated after mother and son were pursued by stormtroopers. Norra quickly discovered that Temmin had not returned. When Esmelle remarked that Temmin would be fine, Norra criticized her older sister for allowing him to run a junk shop and get involved with criminals. Esmelle responded in a tongue and cheek fashion by telling her younger sister that she had raised him to be smart and independent.[1]
            Norra then scolded Esmelle for not being a good parent to her son. Esmelle responded by criticizing Norra for leaving her son behind to join the Rebel Alliance. Esmelle also attributed Temmin's association with criminals to her brother-in-law Brentin's arrest at the hands of the Imperial authorities. Norra sprung to her husband's defense and pointed out that he had relayed messages for the Rebellion and helped bring about the New Republic. Esmelle countered by remarking that Norra had won the war but lost her son.[1]
            Before a fight could break out, Shirene diffused the situation by offering Esmelle and Norra tea. Esmelle walked into the kitchen and left Shirene and Norra to talk. After Norra had rescued Temmin with the help of the bounty hunter Jas Emari and the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus and Temmin's B1 battle droid "Mister Bones" had entered the house, Esmelle asked if Temmin's droid was okay.[1]
            She told Norra that the droid meant a lot to Temmin because he had built the droid to cope with his mother leaving to find her husband. When Norra remarked that droids could not be friends with sentient beings, Esmelle pointed out that Mister Bones had protected Temmin from a gang of bullies. Norra was not happy to be reminded of her failure to be a proper mother. When Esmelle criticized Norra for her involvement in the Rebellion, Norra countered that war was coming to Akiva and that no amount wishing would change that fact. Esmelle tried to protest but Norra pushed past her.[1]
            Esmelle and Shirene stayed at home while Norra, Temmin, Mister Bones, Jas, and Sinjir joined forces to disrupt the Imperial Future Council's emergency summit at the Satrap's Palace. Due to the combined efforts of Norra, her son, and her team, the citizens of Myrra rose up in revolt against the Satrapy of Myrra and the Empire. Following a Rebellion on Akiva, the New Republic dispatched a fleet to expel the Empire from Akiva.[1] After the battle, Norra and Temmin repaired Mister Bones using spareparts from Esmelle and Shirene's basement. Temmin along with his droid would go on to join his mother Norra in the New Republic's struggle against the Imperial remnants.[4]
            Following the Battle of Jakku, Esmelle and Shirene attended the funeral of Brentin Wexley, who had perished during the battle while fighting Counselor to the Empire Gallius Rax. During funeral, Temmin also buried the arm of his B1 battle droid Mister Bones. Esmelle and Shirene watched as Temmin comforted the weeping Norra. Norra and Temmin then stayed with the aunts for a few days before returning to their new home on Chandrila.[5]
            Esmelle was a thin and pale human woman with long silvery hair. She was a lesbian and had a same-sex relationship with Shirene. By the time of the Battle of Endor, Esmelle and Shirene were considered elderly by human standards. Esmelle and Shirene had trouble managing her strong-willed and tech-savvy nephew Temmin Wexley. She also regarded Mister Bones as a suitable companion for Temmin. Unlike her sister Norra, Esmelle took an ambivalent stance towards the Rebellion against the Empire. This along with her frequent criticism of Norra for being a deadbeat mother strained relations with her young sister.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Esmelle</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemEsmelle</string></dict>
        <key>Aryn Leneer</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.73.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aryn Leneer was a female Human Jedi Knight and former Padawan of Master Ven Zallow. Leneer was immensely talented in the ways of the Force and was particularly noted for her proficiency in Force empathy. When the Sacking of Coruscant occurred, Leneer fled Alderaan against the wishes of the Jedi High Council, sought the man responsible for the death of her master and fought him in a vicious duel; Darth Malgus. The Sith Lord eventually subdued her with his powers but spared her life. The Jedi High Council disowned Leneer for her actions.[1]
            A Force-sensitive Human orphaned on the planet Balmorra, Aryn Leneer was discovered by Jedi Master Ven Zallow at an early age and taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for induction into the Jedi Order and training in the ways of the Force. Zallow took over Leneer's training immediately, and she quickly learned that her life was to be dedicated solely to the Order and its teachings. Overtime, Leneer developed a strong, emotional bond with Master Zallow, as she perceived him not only as a teacher, but as a father.[1] Leneer constructed multiple lightsabers; her first one was a blue-bladed lightsaber, another one was a yellow-hued bladed lightsaber, and the last one was a green-bladed lightsaber.
            Leneer was eventually made a Jedi Knight and was a member of Havoc Squad with Zeerid Korr in the early days of the Great Galactic War as she fought against the Sith Empire on behalf of the Galactic Republic. A formidable and well honed combatant with a lightsaber she was well respected by her squad mates. Aside from her skill with a lightsaber, Leneer developed her innate empathic abilities during the war, using it to booster morale among her comrades. Although she never consumed alcohol she would go to the cantinas with Havoc Squad after battles and training being a steadfast comrade and friend and would often be the shoulder to cry on after a nights hard drinking. Leneer, in particular, bonded with Korr when she aided him in coping with the death of his wife and the crippling of his daughter.[1]
            When the Imperial fleet invaded the planet Alderaan, Leneer fought alongside the Alderaanian armed forces to hold off the Imperial attack. Wielding her lightsaber and the Force, Leneer fought besides Jedi Knight Satele Shan and helped turn the tide in order to repel the invasion. When Alderaan was secured, Leneer joined Jedi Shan as part of the Republic's delegation for the signing of a peace treaty with the Sith Empire. Led by Master Dar'Nala and Senator Paran Am-Ris, Leneer was stationed within the High Council building on Alderaan with fellow Knight Syo Bakarn. She was uncomfortable being stationed near so many Sith, but used Zallow's teachings to calm herself. When she detected her former master's death through the Force, she realized that the Sith had betrayed the Republic and attacked Coruscant, leading to the death of Master Zallow and many other Jedi.[1]
            After a brief outburst involving an attack on members of the Sith delegation, Leneer was informed that the Jedi were currently negotiating for the Sith to leave Coruscant peacefully. Leneer became extremely angry with the terms, believing that the Sith attack showed that they were clearly not interested in peace. and that the war should continue. She retired to her room where she dealt with the shock of her master's death. She then resolved to track down and kill the man who murdered their master. Although Syo attempted to convince her not to leave, she managed to escape the High Council building and depart for Eeseen spaceport. Despite being spotted by Jedi Vollen Sor and his Padawan Keevo, Leneer managed to secure passage off planet.
            Leneer decided that to get through the Sith blockade around Coruscant, she would need an extremely skilled pilot. Her attention then turned to the man who would fit the bill: Zeerid Korr. She began to search for him and located him outside his sister-in-law's apartment on the planet Vulta. Hitching a ride aboard the Fatman, Korr's ship, Leneer made it to Coruscant as part of her mission to discover her master's killer. Their ship was detected and shot down in Coruscant's atmosphere, but she used her strong force abilities to slow her and Zeerid's fall and they landed safely on the surface. Leneer proceeded to take Korr through the Works, an industrial area of Coruscant and managed to enter the Temple. Finding the Jedi Temple in ruins, Leneer located her droid T-7 and also found a recording of her master's death. She pieced together the clues as to her master's killer, discovering that it was the dreaded Darth Malgus who had led the attack. She later went back to the ruins of the Temple without Korr, who was busy scouting a spaceport to escape the planet through, and she entered into a fierce duel with the Sith Lord, who had also returned to the Temple. Following a lengthy display of athleticism, she fought to a draw and left the battle early when Zeerid learned where she was and interrupted the combat, rescuing her. Leneer, who was full of hate at that time, thought she could inflict more pain by killing Malgus' lover, Eleena Daru. Korr realized her plan and tried to convince her otherwise, but she refused to listen to him. Korr then explained the plan to escape Coruscant to her.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aryn_Leneer</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemArynLeneer</string></dict>
        <key>Jyn Erso</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.74.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jyn Erso was a human female soldier and former criminal who became a pivotal member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic when she led Rogue One in stealing the Death Star plans during the Battle of Scarif. She was the daughter of Lyra Erso, a devout member of the Church of the Force, and scientist Galen Erso, who was forced into helping the Galactic Empire build the Death Star. Erso's mother was killed when Director Orson Krennic, the commander of the Death Star project, kidnapped her father—who affectionately referred to his daughter as "Stardust." She was raised by resistance fighter Saw Gerrera and became a child soldier in his army.
            After being abandoned by the Partisans, Erso spent several years on her own, committing a number of crimes in order to survive in a dangerous galaxy. In 0 BBY, she was recruited by the Rebel Alliance to find Gerrera on Jedha, where he had information about Galen and the Death Star project. She found a holographic recording of her father who confirmed the existence of the Death Star and that the plans kept on Scarif would reveal a fatal weakness he planted in its design. She attempted to save her father on Eadu, but he was killed. With little support from the Rebel Alliance, Jyn and Captain Cassian Andor led a squad, Rogue One, to Scarif where they stole the plans from the Imperial security complex. She transmitted the plans to the Alliance Fleet that arrived in orbit, but the Death Star soon fired on Scarif in an attempt to eliminate the Rebel threat. Erso and Andor were the last surviving members of their squad, and they died when the blast reached the complex.
            Erso was remembered fondly by the Rebel leader, Mon Mothma, who believed that she would have become an even more extraordinary person if she had survived. Her sacrifice was not in vain, however. The Rebel Alliance used the plans to discover the flaw Galen built into the battle station, and the weapon was destroyed by Luke Skywalker during the Battle of Yavin, starting a chain reaction which would see the doom of the Empire.
            Jyn Erso was born on the Outer Rim ice planet of Vallt in 21 BBY during the Clone Wars to Galen Erso, a pacifist scientist working for Zerpen Industries, and Lyra Erso, Galen's wife and colleague in the company. Born within a Separatist prison due to her father's refusal to use his intelligence and knowledge of kyber crystals to help the Confederacy in their war against the Galactic Republic, Jyn spent approximately six months in the care of her mother and the caretakers of the complex. At that point, Jyn and her parents were unexpectedly ordered onto a carriage and sent to a spaceport where, to the surprise of her parents, Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic of the Republic Navy, who Galen knew from their time in the Republic's Futures Program, was waiting to extract them and bring them to Coruscant.[1]
            For the next several months, Jyn lived in an apartment in Coruscant's Galactic City while her father looked for work. As the Clone Wars approached its end, Jyn's father was notified by Krennic that he had been offered a position in Helical HyperCom on the planet Lokori. Accepting the offer, the Ersos moved to the world and settled there while Galen worked on the company's renewable energy project.[1]
            In 19 BBY, after several attacks by the Separatists on the planet, the Confederacy launched a large assault on the Helical HyperCom facility and the surrounding area. With a large force of B1 battle droids advancing on the complex, Jyn's parents fled the facility with her in a carrier into the surrounding settlement. With battles raging on multiple sides, the Ersos were rerouted by a group of clone troopers but were eventually surrounded. Climbing up a mound of rubble in front of a building, Lyra and Galen attempted to get atop the structure but found it was too tall. With the battle droids approaching and killing the remaining Lokori in the vicinity, Galen placed himself in front of Jyn and Lyra. To their surprise and relief however, the droids suddenly shut down. Unknown to them, the Clone Wars had just ended.[1]
            With the war over, the Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire by former Supreme Chancellor, now Emperor, Sheev Palpatine. Krennic, having convinced Galen to work for the Empire in a supposed kyber crystal sustainable energy project which was in fact a superweapon development program called Project Celestial Power, relocated the Erso family to the project's complex, built upon the former B'ankor Refuge. As Galen's work went on he became more distant from Jyn, who spent a lot of her time in the care of an MV nanny droid nicknamed "Mac-Vee." During this time, Jyn would watch bedtime holodramas, such as The Octave Stairway.[1]
            When she was three years old, Jyn, along with her mother, Has Obitt and Nari Sable, traveled to the Outer Rim planet of Alpinn on Krennic's request to help with the archeological project being conducted there. While there, Jyn would go exploring with the three of them and would revel in being at the center of attention back at the archeological camp. After returning to Coruscant, Jyn's father was more distant than ever, especially in regards to Lyra. Unbeknownst to Jyn, their indifference was a product of their conflicting views of Project Celestial Power, with each of her parents keeping secrets from the other.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jyn_Erso</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJynErso</string></dict>
        <key>Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.75.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy, better known by her nickname Scout, was a female Human Jedi Padawan who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic during the time of the Clone Wars.
            A native of Vorzyd V, the young Human Force-sensitive Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy was born to poor parents in the slums of their world. When a recruiter for the Jedi Order passed through the planet's ports, the family begged the Jedi to take their child offworld and train her in the Order. Turning the girl over to the Coruscant Jedi Temple, Enwandung-Esterhazy entered into the Temple's academy and began training in the ways of the Force. Despite her tenacity and will to succeed, Enwandung-Esterhazy had a relatively weak connection to the Force; many of her instructors doubted that she would pass the Trials of Knighthood and that she was destined for the Jedi Service Corps. Earning the nickname Scout due to her ability to quickly analyze a situation using the Force, Enwandung-Esterhazy focused on honing her physical abilities in order to compensate for her poor performance in Force-related exercises.[1]
            During the later stages of the Separatist Crisis, Enwandung-Esterhazy was selected by Master Chankar Kim to be her apprentice, much to the surprise of many of the academy's instructors and students. Under Master Kim's tutelage, Enwandung-Esterhazy constructed a sky blue-bladed lightsaber and honed her abilities in many unorthodox maneuvers. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Master Kim dutifully accompanied Master Mace Windu to Geonosis on a major rescue mission and laid down her life during the ensuing battle. Devastated when news of her master's untimely death reached the Temple, Enwandung-Esterhazy felt certain that the Council of Reassignment would place her in the Agricultural Corps; a move that was championed by Master Jai Maruk, who expressed his opinion to Grand Master Yoda after the girl had remained at the Temple for two years awaiting reassignment. Master Yoda did not agree with Maruk's assessment, and bet Maruk that Enwandung-Esterhazy would win the annual Jedi Temple Apprentice Tournament, with the wager being that Maruk would choose her as his Padawan should she win. Maruk agreed, and was shocked after Enwandung-Esterhazy survived all eight rounds and won the tournament through creative, non-Force methods. Maruk hesitantly took her as his Padawan, and she ascended to the rank of Commander within the Grand Army of the Republic.[1]
            Near the end of the Clone Wars, the Jedi learned that Count Dooku, leader of the Confederacy, had taken over Château Malreaux on Vjun. Dooku then made a plea to Master Yoda, claiming that the war had gotten out of hand and that he was willing to negotiate a truce. Master Yoda selected a small group of Jedi to come along with him to Vjun, bringing Masters Maruk and Maks Leem, as well as their respective Padawans, Enwandung-Esterhazy and Vjun native Whie Malreaux.[1]
            On the way to Vjun, the Jedi stopped at Phindar Station, and were ambushed by Sith assassin Asajj Ventress and a group of assassin droids. During the battle, Masters Maruk and Leem engaged Ventress in a lightsaber duel, but she proved to be the better duelist. Maruk nearly gave in to the dark side, but was calmed by Leem; despite this, Maruk was slashed across the stomach, mortally wounding him, and Leem was stabbed in the back, killing her. As Maruk lay dying, Enwandung-Esterhazy clambered to his side and begged him not to leave her. With his last breath he told her, "Never... my Padawan." Enwandung-Esterhazy had lost her second Master to the Clone Wars, but the Jedi pressed on from the station to Vjun.[1]
            After landing planetside, Master Yoda left the Padawans and began negotiations with Count Dooku. While the Padawans investigated tremors in the Force that Malreaux had felt they ended up running into Ventress once more. Both Padawans were quickly captured and Enwandung-Esterhazy was held by Ventress in a Force-grip. Ventress, sensing Malreaux's feelings for Enwandung-Esterhazy, tried to tempt the boy to the dark side by telling him to kiss his vulnerable companion. Holding the life of Enwandung-Esterhazy in her hand, she forced him to choose. Malreaux struggled with the decision, but Enwandung-Esterhazy managed to speak through Ventress' grip, telling Malreaux that she knew he would make the right decision. Malreaux resisted Ventress' temptations, much to her chagrin. Just as Ventress prepared to give the order to kill the Padawans, the battle droid, Solis, arrived and attacked Ventress, giving the two adolescents time to escape. Soon, Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker arrived to rescue Yoda and the Padawans, and Enwandung-Esterhazy returned with them to Coruscant afterward.[1]
            Remaining at the Jedi Temple for the rest of the war, Enwandung-Esterhazy was present when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine betrayed the Order and issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army, commanding them to turn their blasters on the Jedi and execute them. Escaping the Temple as Darth Vader invaded with the 501st Legion, Enwandung-Esterhazy was later found by Nyreen Vollen, who brought her to Mandalore in the company of fellow Jedi Kina Ha. When Enwandung-Esterhazy first arrived on Mandalore, her new guardian Kal Skirata was initially shocked by the girl's resemblance to another Jedi, recently deceased Etain Tur-Mukan; the similarities almost brought him to tears and made him struggle to keep his composure. The strill Lord Mirdalan even thought she was Tur-Mukan and got excited upon first seeing her. Enwandung-Esterhazy lived in Kyrimorut and bonded with Mij Gilamar, who agreed to give her some first aid training, and scientist Ovolot Qail Uthan who made Enwandung-Esterhazy her assistant. When Skirata made a deal with fugitive Jedi Master Djinn Altis to take in the Jedi who were staying in Kyrimorut, Enwandung-Esterhazy decided that she wanted to stay on Mandalore with Gilamar and Uthan, but was unwilling to give up being a Jedi.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tallisibeth_Enwandung-Esterhazy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTallisibethEnwandungEsterhazy</string></dict>
        <key>Elinda</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.76.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elinda was a female Human singer who was the first member and original lead singer of the The Twisted Rancor Trio, a band hailing from the planet Taris.
            Elinda was originally hired as the lead singer of the new band The Twisted Rancor Trio as part of a ploy by the band's manager Gilthos Uksaris to convince her to date him. Aside from Elinda, the band consisted of the Bith Ujaa as musical director and his brother Ujii. Elinda, however, threatened to leave the band when she found Ujaa to be a terrible musician. In order not to lose her, Gilthos dismissed Ujaa immediately and hired Loopa as his replacement. As Ujaa's brother, Ujii was upset by this development and retired from the band, resulting in another Bith Fodo taking his place.
            The band became increasingly successful following this, and Elinda's voice was especially popular her homeworld. During the Jedi Civil War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, the band gained enough renown to attract the attention of the local businessman named Davik Kang, who invited them to perform at his estate. Thrilled at the prospect of performing for such a powerful man, Uksaris saw this as the band's big break. Elinda did not share in his excitement. Having heard valid rumors concerning Kang's connections to the crime syndicate the Exchange, she feared for her life should she have any dealings with Davik Kang. Unable to persuade her to accept the invitation, Uksaris hired her sister Ashana on the eve of their scheduled performance, a plan that was risky given Ashana's untested singing.
            While visiting the Lower City Apartments during the Sith quarantine of Taris, Revan discovered a security crate delivered to Gilthos Uksaris protected by a Holo-Sec Corp anti-theft explosive. In unlocking the crate, he was required to activate the holoprojectors of each member of The Twisted Rancor Trio in order of their recruitment to it. Through a datapad nearby within which held the contents of brief history of the band, Revan learned of the story of Elinda and the other members of the band and used this as a guide to safely unlock the footlocker.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Elinda</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemElinda</string></dict>

        <key>Isplourrdacartha Estillo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.78.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Princess Isplourrdacartha Estillo of Eiattu 6, known as Plourr Ilo for short, was a Human female member of the royal family of her homeworld, the capital of Ado sector in the Mid Rim, who was exiled and became a warrior in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, before being called home to take up the reins of government among her people.
            Plourr grew up as one of the three daughters of the reigning monarch, Uthorrferrell Cartha, but under her father and grandfather, the monarchy was forced to concede much of its honor in their accommodation with the Galactic Empire, and when she was still a young girl, the royal family were overthrown by the Eiattuan aristocracy, who preferred to negotiate directly with the Empire on their own terms.
            The initial coup was bloodless, but a faction of the nobility subsequently had the dynasty extinguished with savage, sadistic violence. In the chaos, Plourr was the only member of the royal house to escape; although in fact, it was Plourr herself, and not the Priamsta, who killed arguably the most important member of the ruling dynasty: her vicious, psychotic brother Prince Harran, who had become Darth Vader's protégé, and who attempted to stop her escaping so he could watch her die.
            Not much is known about the first years of Plourr's exile, except that she seems to have picked up a great deal of engineering knowledge and some piloting skills. The muscular, shaven-headed mechanic who eventually found her way into the Alliance to Restore the Republic was hardly recognizable as a princess of ancient lineage. By the time of the Battle of Endor, she was serving as a non-commissioned technician aboard Admiral Ackbar's flagship Home One, and after Endor, she transferred to fly X-wings; although her attitude caused her problems in her early units, her reputation as a tough, brilliant pilot led Wedge Antilles to bring her into Rogue Squadron, where she quickly earned a lieutenant's rank.
            Highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, Plourr combined her great physical strength and athletic appearance with a rather short temper and an almost eternally suspicious attitude; especially towards incompetent starfighter mechanics, many of whom fell victim to the combination of strength and mood. She also excelled in black humor, not passing the opportunity to let go of a wry comment or two, even in the heat of battle. A warrior, she took great pride in military action and preferred head-to-head combat to covert operations, even though her service with the Rogues meant that she had to participate in more undercover missions than the average fighter pilot.
            Understandably, given her upbringing, Plourr hated the Galactic Empire and everything that it stood for. Some months into her service with the Rogues, however, she was recalled to her homeworld, where the ruling council of the nobility, the Priamsta, hoped that she could become the figurehead of a unity regime, ending both the tyranny of Moff Leonia Tavira and the terrorism of the People's Liberation Battalion, led by an impostor who claimed to be Prince Harran. With the help of the Rogues Plourr successfully exposed the false Harran as a fraud—and, moreover, an agent of Tavira's. Taking power as Princess of the Realm and Empress Apparent-Heir, Plourr subsequently remained on Eiattu to lead her people once the Imperials had been expelled, insisting on ruling with the cooperation of the people and not simply the Priamsta, and was reunited with her father's cousin, to whom she was betrothed to as a child, Count Rial Pernon.
            This did not, however, end her association with the Rogues: she brought Eiattuan starfighter forces to support the Rogues on Malrev IV, and Wedge allowed her to return to serve with them when she was able to, as she did in helping to retrieve Imperial defector Baron Soontir Fel's family on Corellia from the clutches of Imperial agent Ilir Post. However, her duties on Eiattu demanded much of her time, and with Rial by her side, she grew rapidly into the role of planetary leader. She even began to grow her hair out again. Her instincts in conflict situations were still often for direct military intervention, however, as was seen not just at Malrev IV, but later when she offered to lead her fleet to rescue the captured Princess Leia Organa; actually a disguised Winter; who had been kidnapped by the pirate gang now led by the ousted Leonia Tavira.
            Plourr's story was based on the story of Anastasia, the Russian princess who several claimants falsely posed as after her death following the overthrow of the Czar.[source?] She was originally supposed to be Quarren, but Mike Baron overlooked that part of the outline given to him by Michael A. Stackpole. Nrin Vakil was later created to fill in the gap.
            Plourr is described in dialogue in The Warrior Princess as Uthorrferrell Cartha's youngest daughter, but a panel in the comic seems to show her as the middle daughter, with a younger sibling even younger than Prince Harran; it is possible that one sister is absent in the photo and the younger child is a brother not directly mentioned in the text. Alternatively, the woman beside her father might actually be Plourr's eldest sister rather than her mother, who is nowhere mentioned in the text. This would make the child sitting on her lap is in fact a nephew or niece.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Isplourrdacartha_Estillo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemIsplourrdacarthaEstillo</string></dict>

            Magva Yarro participated in the peaceful protest against the Galactic Empire that turned into the Ghorman Massacre. Surviving the incident, she joined up with Saw Gerrera's Partisans to oppose the Empire, believing that the Alliance to Restore the Republic were ineffective cowards. Within the Partisans she served as a forward spotter for the Cavern Angels X-wing starfighter squadron, and also commanded her own UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft.[3]
            Yarro was present in the Partisans base in the Catacombs of Cadera on the moon Jedha in the year 0 BBY,[2] when a group including Gerrera's adoptive daughter Jyn Erso were brought in as captives. Shortly after their arrival, the Partisans were forced to flee from their base when the Empire destroyed Jedha City with their Death Star superweapon, creating a blast wave that also eventually destroyed the catacombs.[1]
            Magva Yarro first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 16, 2016. The film did not identify Yarro, but she received a name in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Magva_Yarro</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMagvaYarro</string></dict>

She was from Sood, the capital of the planet Acherin. Her mother died when she was a young girl, so she was raised by her father. She traveled the galaxy with her father as a child to places such as factories, trade shows, and the Senate. After her father died, she became head of Yarrow Industries. Once the Empire invaded Acherin, the operations of Yarrow Industries was moved off-planet. Eve was then imprisoned by the Imperials, however, she claimed to have escaped prison, and managed to move her wealth off-planet, to Niro 11.
            It was likely at this time Yarrow became an Imperial spy who answered directly to Darth Vader. Under the alias of Flame, she set up Operation Moonstrike, a plan that appeared to form a major Rebellion. However, this plan was actually part of Operation Twilight, a scheme to eliminate many resistance leaders all at once.
            Yarrow met up with Ferus Olin and his group, befriending them and gaining their trust. After many months together, Flame eventually proposed the idea of gathering all major resistance leaders and moving them to Ferus' base. When the ships were nearing the asteroid base, Yarrow was discovered by Olin. Due to the influence of a Sith holocron, Ferus ordered for her execution, it was later decided that she was to be left on the uninhabited moon, XT987. Although Yarrow was discovered, operation Twilight was a success- all resistance leaders were destroyed by the superweapon attached to Vader's Star Destroyer. However, Ferus, Trever and Lune managed to escape.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eve_Yarrow</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemEveYarrow</string></dict>
        <key>Yuon Par</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.81.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Yuon Par was a female Human Jedi Master serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Cold War with the reconstituted Sith Empire.
            A Force-sensitive female Human, Yuon Par was brought into the Jedi Order at a young age. As a student, Yuon Par went with Cin Tykan, Eriz Vossan, Sidonie Garen, Duras Fain, and Parkanas Tark during a mission to explore the planet Malachor III. However, during the mission, they encountered Terrak Morrhage, the spirit of the ancient Sith Lords who pulled the Jedi under his spell. Both Par and Fain succumbed to the influence of the spirit, giving into their passions for one another. Before falling, she and the Jedi expedition managed to escape the planet when her friend Parkanas, the youngest member of the group, was left behind. Over the years during the Great Galactic War, Yuon rose to the rank of Jedi Master at the end of the war.[1]
            Training as a Consular, Par became a respected scholar, specialized as an archaeologist and recognized as responsible for the reclamation of the lost Gharnus Texts and a holocron crafted by Master Odan-Urr.[1]
            As well as her research into the prehistory of the Jedi Order, Master Par was a skilled diplomat and successfully negotiated peace between warring clans of Gamorreans and became the bloodsister of a Kaleesh chieftain, all through her works in the field. When the Jedi Order was forced to relocate to their ancestral homeworld, Tython, following the sacking of Coruscant, the loss of the Jedi Temple there, and the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, Master Par began teaching a class on the history of the Order to Initiates at the new Temple there.[1]
            At one time, during her studies, Par met the Trandoshan Qyzen Fess on Belkadan. He traded whatever he found in some ruins for snake-bite medicine. Since then, they had become close friends, though some of the Jedi put that into question.[1]
            In 3643 BBY, Yuon Par and Jedi High Council Member, Master Syo Bakarn greeted a young Padawan, whose Force powers manifested at a very early age. She apologized to the Padawan for been late since she was working a lot on her archaeological inquiries. After her introducing herself, she explained to her apprentice about an urgent matter: a team of Jedi researchers had recently uncovered several teaching holograms that were made by the founders of the Jedi Order—in the region known as the Tythonian Gnarls. However, the researchers encountered the native Flesh Raiders that started to rampage through the region and failed to retrieve the hologram projectors of Cala Brin, Garon Jard, Ters Sendon, and Rajivari. Her apprentice was successful in defeating the attacking Flesh Raiders and retrieved three of the projectors. However, the fourth hologram projector of Rajivari had been stolen. Par was concerned of this, but she knew that Flesh Raiders were not known for stealing artifacts. She instructed her apprentice to meet her back into the Jedi Temple.[1]
            After her apprentice completed her trials and defeated the Dark Adept, Nalen Raloch, Yuon Par proudly pronounced her pupil a Jedi before the Council. Then suddenly, she collapsed while in mid-sentence. Yuon was transferred to a medical facility on Coruscant in the Senate Tower. When the Consular and Qyzen later arrived on the Republic capital, they entered to find Yuon muttered incoherently about Parkanas Tark and a darkness that was coming, which would slowly turn her to the dark side. Hoping to find a cure to her illness, the Consular sought out the Noetikons. After recovering the Noetikon of Science and Light, the Consular was called back to the Senate Tower, as Yuon had attacked one of her caretakers. Her illness had worsen, as she failed to recognize Qyzen and her own Padawan, the illness convincing her that they fell to Flesh Raiders, and attacked them as well. The duo managed to subdue her before locating the Noetikon of Secrets. Bringing the Noetikons to the ruined Jedi Temple, the Consular discovered and learned a shielding ritual, which they used to cure Master Par, causing her insanity to fade. Yuon and her Padawan exchanged words before the Consular was called upon by the Council. Yuon had a short time to rest before her Padawan returned to her side, informing her that the Consular had been assigned by the Council to track down all the Jedi Masters affected by the plague.[1]
            Yuon returned to Tython when her Padawan, successful in shielding all the afflicted Masters, was in session with the Council, ditching the Padawans assigned to watch her. She agreed with the Consular's theory that the plaguemaster, Lord Vivicar, was Parkanas Tark, in contrast to the Council's skepticism. She then suggested to her pupil that they drop the shielding ritual on her so she can invert the link between herself and Vivicar in hopes of finding his location. However, this had the result of Vivicar possessing her and attempted to force Yuon to kill her own Padawan. The Consular managed to overcome her, breaking Vivicar's control. Yuon then gave the coordinates and security code for Vivicar's starship before begging her former pupil to end her suffering. The Consular refused, instead restoring the shielding on Yuon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yuon_Par</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemYuonPar</string></dict>
        <key>Eldon Ax</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.82.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Eldon Ax, born Cinzia Xandret, was a Human female and Sith apprentice of Darth Chratis, and later of Darth Howl during the Cold War.
            Cinzia Xandret was stolen from her mother, a droid maker named Lema Xandret, by Darth Chratis while she was still a child. Because Lema Xandrent refused to willingly give up her child to the Sith, she was sentenced to death. Lema Xandret escaped the imposed death sentence by fleeing with some of her fellow droid makers. Darth Chratis imposed a Force powered mental block in Cinzia's mind to prevent her from recalling memories of her past, and renamed her Eldon Ax.
            After losing a battle against a Mandalorian named Dao Stryver, Ax was interrogated by her, who looking for information on Lema Xandret and a ship named Cinzia. It was later found that the remnants of the ship named Cinzia were found and were being auctioned off by a Hutt named Tassaa Bareesh. Prior to giving this information to the Sith Dark Council, Darth Chratis removed the memory block he imposed on Eldon Ax and told her the true story of her existence. Chratis and Ax were dispatched by the Dark Council to steal the remains of the Cinzia and execute Lema Xandret if she was found. During the attempt to steal the remnants of the Cinzia, mysterious and deadly hex droids appeared and thwarted the theft. Although the attempt to steal the artifacts was unsuccessful, Ax was able to use the remains of a hex to trace their origin back to a planet called Sebaddon. The Jedi were also able to do the same. Ax then traveled with her master to claim the planet for the Empire.
            Upon arriving at Sebaddon, the hexes launched a deadly defense of the planet which severely damaged both the Republic and Imperial Fleets. The two fleets brokered a truce and a temporary alliance to defeat the hex threat. To seal the deal, Chratis insisted that Ax accompany Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan, while he himself would take Shan's Padawan Shigar Konshi. During the battle, Ax found a clone of herself that was being kept alive in a tank filled with amnioid fluid. Ax also found that her mother had been killed by her own Hex Droid creations, but continued to exist and speak to her clone through the amnioid fluid. Ax learned from her clone that the Hex Droids were created to protect her. Upon release from the amnioid tank, the clone immediately died, but not before instructing Ax to feed her DNA into the hex computer. The hexes recognized Ax as Cinzia and followed her commands. Eldon Ax eventually killed her master Darth Chratis when she ordered hex droids to attack him during the battle on Sebaddon. She then ordered them to destroy themselves. Later, she became the apprentice of Darth Howl, a member of the Dark Council.
            A cunning young woman, Ax managed to kill her own master and cover it up. Recognized by the Dark Council, she eventually became a full apprentice to Darth Howl, no small feat in the merciless ranks of the Sith Empire.
            When she had learned of her origins, Ax, with her loyalties to the Sith, wanted to see her mother dead for her betrayal and wasn't afraid to admit that to anyone, even the Jedi.
            Ax possessed a small ability for Force lightning and was a capable lightsaber duelist. Despite her age, when concentrating her rage, Ax was also quite adept at using Force barrier to prevent herself from getting seriously damaged, though she could still be outnumbered and overwhelmed when numbers were against her or when she was distracted, like in her battles with the Mandalorian Dao Stryver.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eldon_Ax</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemEldonAx</string></dict>
        <key>Elin Garza</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.83.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elin Garza was a Human female who served the Galactic Republic as a General in the Republic Army during the Great Galactic War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the war, she helped found an elite special forces division of the Republic military, and assisted in the training of the division's soldiers. After the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, Garza was often accused of ordering covert assaults on Imperial holdings in the galaxy.
            Elin Garza was born in the year 3696 BBY on the Galactic Republic's capital of Coruscant. When the Great Galactic War began with the resurgent Sith Empire in 3681 BBY, Garza forged her identity credentials at the age of 15 in order to enlist in the Republic Military. She soon reached the rank of lieutenant and was awarded the command of an entire platoon in the 45th Infantry Division. In 3673 BBY, Garza's unit was shot down on Bomodon during the Great Galactic War, where she met Republic Strategic Information Service agent Marcus Trant and fought a ten-month campaign to liberate the planet from the Empire. She later married Trant but divorced him two years later, and her second husband was a navy captain named Joron Tal'vor.
            During her career, she was awarded a number of commendations, including the Medal of Valor, the Silver Crescent, the Mark of Dedication, and the Chancellor's Service Medal. When the resurgent Sith Empire launched a full-scale assault on the Republic, Garza served with distinction, and helped to found a elite special forces division of the Republic military.[1]
            However, in 3653 BBY, the Republic and the Sith Empire signed the Treaty of Coruscant, marking an official end to the conflict.[3] In the years that followed, Garza was accused numerous times of ordering covert assaults on Imperial holdings throughout the galaxy.[1]
            One such incident occurred on Ando Prime. After learning of an Imperial offensive on the world, Garza sent Havoc Squad to cut it off. The squad was forced to call for rescue, but Garza's attempt was stopped by the Senate. It turned out that Garza had not had the Senate's approval for the first Ando Prime mission, and the senators refused to allow her to risk another war with the Empire. Havoc Squad managed to get home on its own, but this incident left a deep scar on its members.
            By 3643 BBY, during the Cold War, Commander Harron Tavus led members from Havoc Squad to defect to the Empire. The only Havoc member to have stayed loyal to the Republic was a newly transferred sergeant, now promoted to lieutenant and new Havoc Squad commander. Garza summoned the new Havoc to Coruscant to eliminate Tavus' underworld assets on the planet before going after the traitors. Garza made it clear to Havoc that the mission is to be taken under complete secrecy, including non-disclosure to non-SpecForce personnel. After Havoc finally tracked down all the Havoc traitors, Garza promoted the Havoc CO to the rank of Captain.
            However, Garza was forced to cut Havoc's shore leave short when they received intelligence about a new Imperial superweapon, codenamed Gauntlet. She dispatched Havoc to Tatooine to extract an undercover SIS agent with the intel. Once it was determined that the Gauntlet could fire through hyperspace, a joint military initiative was formed. However, Garza felt that Havoc needed to be brought up to full strength, and dispatched the squad to recruit two new members crucial to the mission, Tanno Vik on Balmorra, and Sergeant Yuun on Hoth, as well as extract the Safecrackers on Quesh.
            Once Havoc succeeded in destroying the Gauntlet, Garza promoted the CO to the rank of major. Unfortunately, their victory was not without repercussions. The Gauntlet's destruction incensed Imperial General Arkos Rakton, who declared outright hostilities against the Republic. His first move was capturing a group of Republic-aligned heads of state, forcing their respective planets to allow Imperial forces to bypass their borders to assault Republic holdings. Garza had Havoc infiltrate the space station where the hostages were being held.
            After Havoc successfully rescued the hostages, as well as made an enemy out of Rakton, Garza deployed Havoc to reinforce the Republic offensive, starting with extracting the Dagger Wing, a disavowed Republic fighter wing imprisoned on Belsavis for a botched mission that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Imperial citizens on Fest. Regardless, Garza felt that the Republic needed Dagger Wing, as starfighter pilots of their caliber were in short supply.
            Secondly, Havoc was dispatched to space station A-77 to liberate POWs. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a trap set by Rakton, though Havoc survived the encounter.
            Lastly, was the planet Voss, where Senator Evran was withholding thousands of Republic soldiers from the war effort for fear that the Empire would attack Voss again. And as he had Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus' complete confidence, even Garza couldn't overrule him. Thus, Havoc was forced to eliminate any Imperial invasion vectors, making the overall Republic military presence unnecessary. Havoc proceeded to foil Lord Torius' plan to utilize the stolen ZR-57 orbital strike bomb to hold Voss-Ka hostage.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Elin_Garza</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemElinGarza</string></dict>
        <key>Fable Astin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.84.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Fable Astin was a female Human Jedi Knight who served in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. She was one of the few Jedi to grow up during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, Astin apprenticed herself to the notorious Inquisitor Adalric Brandl. It was during this time that Astin fell in love with Adalric's son Jaalib. After training with Adalric, Astin returned to service in the Rebellion.
            Fable Astin was born to a Jedi Knight around the time when the Galactic Empire was established by Emperor Palpatine. Astin's mother fell in love with her Padawan, and the two conceived a young girl strong in the Force. Unfortunately, shortly after this, Astin's father was killed by a rival when Astin was still just a baby. The remainder of Astin's young life was spent on the run from the Empire. It was during this time that Astin developed a talent for hiding her emotions of fear and sadness. As an adolescent, Astin picked up a lightsaber and began to practice with it. Astin's mother was duly surprised having found herself unable to sense her young daughter's feelings.
            From that moment on, Astin's training began, and she was schooled in the art of Jedi meditation and several other remedial Force powers. Eventually, Astin joined the Rebel Alliance assisting in sabotage missions against the Empire.
            Fable Astin's service in the rebellion eventually led to her promotion to captain and command of her own ship, the Prodigal. Astin was in charge of the Harrier Infiltration Team, a special ops team composed of herself, Deke Holman, and Tech Officer Arecelis Acosta. Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, Astin's team was ordered by Commander Beatonn to destroy a communications bunker in construction on Nysza III. The three team members loaded a backpack full with thermal detonators and made their way into the bunker through a construction tunnel. The plan was to drop the detonators in a pre-planned position and escape before the timed explosion.
            As the team entered the bunker, they discovered a lack of security and easily made it to the checkpoint. After this, the plan fell apart. Vialco, a Dark Jedi assigned with protecting the bunker, killed Arecelis and engaged Astin in a duel. Vialco was much more skilled and was able to play on Astin's fears. The duel abruptly ended with Vialco Force pushing Astin across the bunker's inner chamber. Astin ordered a retreat, and she and Deke were able to escape by crawling through a construction tunnel full of stagnant water. The bunker was destroyed and the duo fled offworld to the planet of Iscera.
            Grieving over their dead friend, Astin and Deke waited on Iscera for their next orders. To keep their minds off the recent tragedy, Deke grabbed tickets to a local play, For the Want of an Empire. Although initially skeptical of what a small planet like Iscera had to offer in terms of theater, Astin became captivated by the leading man. Jaalib Brandl's acting was flawless and Fable was enthralled to see how he handled a prop sword with such skill and poise. Astin hurried to meet the young actor after the play, but Jaalib was hurrying off-world and their meeting was brief.
            Astin and Deke returned to their ship, and that's when the nightmares began. Vialco began to penetrate Astin's dreams in an effort to turn her to the dark side. The nightmares would replay her failure in Nysza III and the death of Arecelis. One dream in particular became so vivid that Astin burned herself with her own lightsaber. Astin decided she needed further training to defend against Vialco's attacks, and was reminded of Jaalib's skill with a sword on stage. After a database search by Deke, Astin learned that Jaalib's father was the Inquisitor Adalric Brandl. Astin decided to seek out Adalric and ask for him to train her.
            The database search also revealed the current home of Jaalib, the remote planet of Trulalis. Borrowing an X-wing on Iscera, Astin traveled through hyperspace to Trulalis while still being assaulted by dark side dreams of Vialco. Astin landed on Trulalis and made her way on foot to the Kovit settlement. At the small town, Astin saw evidence of the carnage that had killed the town years before, but beyond that was an enormous black, blaster-scored amphitheater. Astin felt drawn to the building and inside she found Lord Adalric and his son Jaalib practicing lines from the play Uhl Eharl Khoehng. Jaalib was the first to see the young woman, and he became furious, grabbing Astin and trying to lead her back to her ship. However, Adalric had other ideas, and he stopped his son with a light touch on the shoulder.
            Adalric agreed to train Astin, and her first lesson involved training in lightsaber combat. The training consisted of a series of cadences in which one manipulated small ball bearings placed atop tall candle wicks. This technique had been developed by Vo'ren Faalo, and Astin initially excelled at the exercise. Unfortunately, when Adalric upped the difficulty level, Astin faltered and was unable to perform the exercise. Adalric became furious with Astin, ridiculing her for her weaknesses and inability to perform up to his standards.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fable_Astin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemFableAstin</string></dict>
        <key>Elara Dorne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.85.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elara Dorne was a female Human born into a prestigious military family on Dromund Kaas during the Great Galactic War. In only two years of service in Imperial army, she witnessed enough atrocities and war crimes to completely lose faith in the Empire and defect to the Galactic Republic. Given her flawless operational record, Elara was was allowed to join the Republic Military as personnel number 22-795, becoming the sergeant of the Search and Rescue Squad 204. When posted on Taris under Colonel Gaff, she volunteered to assist Havoc Squad with their secret mission after Gaff resued to cooperate. For her support, Republic Special Forces Division General Elin Garza offered Dorne a position in the Havoc Squad, which she gladly accepted.
            With the Havoc Squad, Elara Dorne participated in assignments to hunt down defector Harron Tavus and his followers, neutralize the Imperial Gauntlet superweapon, reclaim the Bastion during the Battle of Corellia and apprehend Imperial General Arkos Rakton, earning several Medals of Valor and a Gold Crescent. Elara helped her brother Aleksei Dorne to also defect to the Republic, which caused Republic Personnel Division Captain Kalor to suspect her of hiding information. Kalor sought to reopen inquiry about Elara's status as a defector, which threatened to pull her from active duty, but Dorne launched a preemptive strike, using Service Code 1 to require an immediate hearing with the Personnel Division and presenting the evidence of her every interaction with Kalor over the years. When the futility of the man's action became apparent, any suspicions regarding Elara were dropped, granting her full citizenship and legal status within the Galactic Republic.
            Elara Dorne remained a member of Havoc Squad for over five years, until the galaxy was invaded by the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. During the Eternal Empire conquest Havoc's Commanding Officer got missing and after the Squad went to search for them, they received an official reprimand, which gave Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh an excuse to remove the ex-Imperial from Republic's most elite unit. Elara's career was saved by the Supreme Commander Jace Malcom, who assigned her to his personal staff and promoted her to Captain. When the Republic received an anonymous intel regarding an immensely powerful superweapon on a recently rediscovered world of Iokath, Malcom send Elara as an ambassador to the Alliance Commander, with the orders to sabotage the meeting and escape should the Alliance turn against the Republic. Taken captive by Lana Beniko Elara presented herself to the Alliance Commander and arranged a holocall with Commander Malcom.
            Elara was born on Dromund Kaas to a highly prestigious Imperial family, whose members served in the Imperial Military for many generations as part of the familiy tradition. Born and raised during the Great Galactic War, Elara followed her father Vasil Dorne in enlisting in the military in medical specialization in 3648 BBY[4]; her brother Aleksei joined in the technical specialization on the same day. Both siblings were proud to serve in the military, and over her two years of service in the Cold War against the Galactic Republic Elara earned more commendations than most men typically earned in ten. Serving under commander Thorus, she witnessed the man commit numerous war crimes which included executing hundreds of civilian non-combatants and ordering full-scale bombings of unarmed populations in circumvention of direct orders from the Imperial High Command. Elara became disillusioned with the Empire, whose soldiers routinely violated their own regulations and goals without cause and any notions of discipline and honor were discarded the moment a Sith asked it. Refusing to participate in atrocities her comrades in arms committed, Elara raised her concerns to her superiors, but the only thing questioned was her resolve to the cause. Strongly suspecting that she would be forced to prove her loyalty by carrying out orders directly against her consciense, Elara made a decision to defect to the Republic in 3646 BBY.[5] Noting numerous inefficiencies in her unit's assigned routes, she slipped away during a night patrol and surrendered to the first Republic unit she came across, declaring her intention to defect.[2]
            Given her extensive training and knowledge of the Imperial military protocols and culture, Elara Dorne was allowed to join the Republic Military as personnel number 22-795 under Service Code 37-R, becoming the sergeant of the Search and Rescue Squad 204. In the next three years she earned several commendations for rescuing wounded soldiers under fire in enemy territory, including two Medals of Valor. However, as part of the condition that allowed her to serve in the military, regulation 449 required her to make regular reports on her activities to the Personnel Division of the Army of the Galactic Republic. Her handler in the Personnel Division was Captain Kalor, who remained convinced that Elara was purposely withholding information. Dorne was not only a "person of concern" for the Personnel Division, but in the Republic as well, as her Kaasi accent was a clear giveaway of her origins as soon as she spoke. Even people who didn't treat her as a potential spy viewed her as a resource to learn more about Imperial military procedures, personnel, and culture. However, Elara viewed this inconvenience as a small price to pay for clear conscience and never regretted her decision to defect, the Republic becoming her home in just a few short years.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Elara_Dorne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemElaraDorne</string></dict>
        <key>Eirtaé</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.86.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Eirtaé was a female Human who served as one of the handmaidens of Padmé Amidala when she was Queen of Naboo.
            Eirtaé was brought up as a wealthy girl in a remote river valley of Naboo.[4]
            She was the only applicant for the Queen's handmaidens who had blond hair and blue eyes in contrast to Amidala's brown hair and brown eyes.[3] She was sometimes known as the "Blond Handmaiden."
            Eirtaé had also taken the same examinations as Amidala to run for the position of Queen, but lost the election to Amidala.
            At first Eirtaé tended to be bossy with the other handmaidens and was resentful toward Amidala, having lost the election to her but they soon became friends.
            Eirtaé and the other handmaidens were trained in self-defense and marksmanship by Amidala's head of security, Captain Panaka.[5] She particularly excelled in dealing with protocol[4] and spotting treachery. However, she was less skilled in martial arts than the other handmaidens.[2]
            In 32 BBY, Eirtaé was one of the three handmaidens who accompanied Amidala to Coruscant when the Trade Federation blockaded Naboo. At the Battle of Naboo, she helped to end the Invasion on Naboo, and was present at the funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn and the celebration following the next day.[3]
            During the Clone Wars, the Jedi High Council discovered that the Confederacy of Independent Systems had paid several outlaws on Coruscant to kidnap Amidala before a crucial speech in the Senate. In an effort to draw out the kidnappers, the Jedi hid Amidala in a safe location and allowed Sabé and Eirtaé to be captured instead. The Council then sent Anakin Skywalker—now a Jedi Knight and, secretly, Amidala's husband—to rescue the Senator; Skywalker was not aware of the exchange that had occurred. Skywalker successfully tracked down the kidnappers and subdued them. He released Amidala's decoys, but did not like that he was not told the truth about the Jedi Council's plans.[6]
            Eirtaé was portrayed by Friday "Liz" Wilson in The Phantom Menace.[3]
            In the children's book Queen in Disguise, Eirtaé's hair was erroneously colored brown,[5] while in the comic story In Triplicate, her name was misspelled as "Eritaé."[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eirta%C3%A9/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemEirtae</string></dict>
        <key>Atris</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.87.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Atris was a Human female who served as a Jedi historian, and later as a Jedi Master and Jedi Council member during the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War. She was deeply committed to the Order and was a fierce adherent of the Jedi Code. But Atris' faith in the righteousness of the Jedi wavered when her personal hero, Meetra Surik, turned her back on the Council to join rogue Knights Revan and Malak and their faction of Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars. Atris chose not to go to war, but this decision left her bitter and conflicted.
            When Surik returned to face the Council's judgment after the devastating events of the Battle of Malachor V, Atris was the first to condemn her, suggesting that she had fallen to the dark side just as Revan had. Over time, Atris grew to hate Surik for complicating her black-and-white view of the Jedi, the Sith, and the Force. During the Dark Wars, Atris called a secret Jedi convocation on the Miraluka world of Katarr in an attempt to find the threat that was stalking the Jedi. She then leaked knowledge of the conclave's existence in the hopes of drawing out the Sith. She succeeded, but with dire consequences; Darth Nihilus devastated the surface of the planet, wiping out all life on Katarr, including the Jedi gathered there.
            Atris remained in seclusion, surrounding herself with Echani Handmaidens who could not feel the Force. She planned to rebuild the Jedi Order, and established a Jedi Academy in the old irrigation system on Telos IV. However, she was heavily influenced by the many Sith holocrons she had collected in her efforts to find and understand the Sith. The holocrons fed her bitterness, and she slowly and quietly fell to the dark side. After a final confrontation on Telos, Meetra Surik convinced Atris to turn away from the dark side. Atris then remained in the Jedi Academy, waiting to be judged for her actions by the new Jedi Council.
            After the end of the Great Sith War that was started by the Sith Lords Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma, the Jedi historian Atris attempted to revise the broken system of Jedi apprenticeship. She argued that there was little wonder why Kun and Qel-Droma fell to the dark side of the Force, when the Jedi had liberal instruction practices in place, such as dozens of Padawans training under a single Master, the radical bonds of reciprocal apprenticeship, and Jedi beginning their training in their teens and later. She invoked thousand-year old recommendations first suggested by the Jedi Master Simikarty, lobbying for the restriction of Padawans that a Master could have at one time, and also limiting the age of Jedi candidates.[1]
            Atris also advocated prohibiting romantic involvement for Jedi, citing that the First Great Schism had been started by two lovers. She even endorsed adoption of a more austere interpretation of the Jedi Code which was favored by the Draethos Jedi Master Odan-Urr, in memory of his death at the hands of Exar Kun at the Jedi Academy on Ossus. Her arguments found powerful purchase amongst the Jedi, and she was appointed to High Council.[1]
            When the Mandalorian Wars erupted in the year 3964 BBY, the Galactic Republic came to the Jedi for assistance. However, Atris resisted the call to protect the inhabitants of the Outer Rim Territories, instead staunchly defending the council's decision to meditate and reflect before taking action.[3]
            Many Jedi did not understand how the Council could sit idly while innocents died, and the order was split when two Jedi Knights named Revan and Malak chose to go to war. Many followed them, including the Jedi Meetra Surik. Atris had held a strong admiration for Surik, viewing her as something of a hero as well as a close friend. When she and Revan left the Order to join the war, rejecting everything that Atris believed in, Atris felt personally betrayed.[3] Atris condemned Revan, his followers, and the "freethinking" teachings of his former Jedi Master, fellow historian Kreia. Revan's eventual turn to the dark side came as little surprise to Atris.[1] Indeed, when Revan met Atris years later asking what happened to Surik, Atris made little effort to conceal her contempt.[4]
            After the war's end, only one of the Jedi who had followed Revan to war returned to face the council: Meetra Surik.[2] She stood before them as an echo in the Force, having cut herself off from it after the final battle at Malachor V. Surik was so defiant, so certain of the rightness of her actions that she caused Atris to doubt herself. Atris wanted to punish Surik for this, and became convinced that she had fallen to the dark side along with all of the others who had followed Revan. She felt that exile was too lenient of a punishment for Surik's betrayal, and believed that she would only join Revan again if she was free. The other Masters warned her to be mindful of her feelings, but Atris insisted that Surik ought to have died at Malachor V, because when she stood before them, it was if she was already dead. The Council decided not to tell Surik that she had become a wound in the Force, which was the result of her actions at Malachor.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Atris</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAtris</string></dict>
        <key>Juno Eclipse</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.88.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Juno Eclipse was a Human female officer and pilot in the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Prior to her service in the Alliance Fleet, Eclipse served in the naval forces of the Galactic Empire. A graduate of the Imperial Academy on Corulag, her homeworld, she ultimately attained the rank of Captain after making a name for herself as an exceptionally skilled TIE pilot. At the height of her military career, the young Imperial officer was personally chosen by Darth Vader—the Dark Lord of the Sith and Emperor Palpatine's apprentice—to lead the Black Eight Squadron. Although she was initially honored to serve under Vader's command, Eclipse was disturbed by the Sith Lord's tactics which she considered excessively brutal.
            In the aftermath of the Bombing of Callos in 3 BBY, Eclipse was reassigned to an experimental stealth vessel called the Rogue Shadow. In this capacity, she would serve as the personal pilot to Darth Vader's secret apprentice, code-named Starkiller. Initially unaware of her passenger's purpose, she learned that the apprentice was an assassin who hunted the Jedi that survived the initial purge of Order 66. After the apprentice betrayed by his Sith Master, Eclipse was arrested and accused of treason due to her association with Starkiller. Disillusioned with the Empire, Eclipse supported the apprentice's efforts to organize a rebellion against the Emperor, but later discovered that Starkiller was still loyal to Vader. This revelation came as a surprise to her, given Starkiller's near death experience and Eclipse's imprisonment, both of which resulted from Vader's plotting. Nevertheless, Eclipse remained faithful to Starkiller but also implored him to reconsider his intentions concerning their newfound allies.
            Following a second betrayal by Vader, who captured the Rebel founders and left Starkiller for dead on Corellia, Eclipse and the apprentice pursued the latter's master to the Death Star in order to rescue the senators Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, and Garm Bel Iblis as well as Jedi Master Rahm Kota. Their mission was successful, but at the cost of the apprentice's life. Eclipse mourned the apprentice, whom she had grown close to during their short time together, yet also remained with the Alliance to honor his legacy. Retaining the rank of Captain, she was granted command of the Rebel flagship Salvation during the onset of the Galactic Civil War. Unknown to Eclipse, Vader had his late apprentice cloned multiple times in an effort to create a more powerful and loyal version of Starkiller. In addition to numerous unstable subjects, the experiment produced Subject 1138—a clone who inherited Starkiller's emotional attachment to Eclipse.
            Juno Eclipse was born on Corulag as the daughter of a teacher and civil engineer. As a child, she developed a fascination with alien cultures and diversity, a trait which her mother encouraged. Early in her life, however, Eclipse was dealt a personal tragedy when her mother died, reportedly caught in the crossfire of an insurrection on Corulag. The loss of her mother left the young Juno in the care of her father, who increasingly became cold and distant after the death of his wife. Nevertheless, Eclipse desperately desired to win the approval of her only remaining parent. As a result, she developed into a loyal supporter of the Galactic Empire, mainly due to the fact that her father was an uncompromising Imperialist who was enamored with those that enlisted into Imperial Military service.[2]
            In addition to being indoctrinated into Emperor Palpatine's New Order, Juno Eclipse's father attempted to impart his Anti-Jedi sentiments to his daughter. A fierce supporter of the Emperor, Eclipse's father loathed the fallen Jedi Order and wholeheartedly believed the Emperor's false account of the Jedi's attempt to seize control of the Galactic Republic by assassinating then-Chancellor Palpatine. Despite her's father obvious contempt towards the Order, Eclipse never developed any personal resentment against the Jedi, mainly due to the fact that she possessed very little knowledge of the Jedi or the Force.[2]
            In a last attempt to win her father's approval once and for all, Juno Eclipse dedicated her young life to entering Imperial service. It was Eclipse's hope that her father would be elated by her career choice, mainly so that she could finally earn the same admiration that he felt for the Empire's enlisted personnel. Despite her youth, Eclipse was accepted into the Imperial Academy on Corulag at the age of fourteen, thus making her the youngest cadet ever to be welcomed into the Empire's military training institution.[3]
            Despite graduating at the top of her class with high honors, Juno Eclipse was heartbroken when her father did not attend her graduation ceremony. Grieved by him for the final time, Eclipse disowned her father and homeworld in order to move on from an unhappy childhood. Having severed her ties to the past, Eclipse decided that her only family from that point on would be the Imperial Navy.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Juno_Eclipse</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJunoEclipse</string></dict>
        <key>Eila</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.89.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Eila was a human female, and the younger sister of Kel. She occasionally saw visions of the future in her dreams. In 34 ABY, she and Kel escaped their homeworld of Tehar after First Order forces led by Kylo Ren massacred their village including their family. Kel and Eila fled to the Colossus platform on the planet Castilon. Despite being pursued by First Order troops led by Commander Pyre, the two siblings managed to find refuge with the help of Resistance pilot Kazuda Xiono and the Chelidae.
            During the New Republic era, Eila and her brother were forced to flee their homeworld of Tehar as stowaways when the army of the First Order, led by Kylo Ren, wiped out their village on their planet, including their parents. The two siblings were the only survivors. When the First Order discovered there were two survivors, they hunted down Eila and Kel, placing a 20,000 credit bounty on them, as they didn't want any word of the atrocity to spread.[1]
            Eventually, the two arrived on the Colossus platform on Castilon, where Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono, in need of cash, had recently heard of the bounty, but not who placed it. He, his friend Neeku Vozo, and the droid BB-8 tracked down the siblings with the assistance of Vozo's Chelidae friends, who worked in engineering. In a chase in the Colossus marketplace after Kel had stolen food from a vendor, Eila broke her leg, which posed problems as any medcentre would ask for their identification.[1]
            When First Order agents led by Commander Pyre arrived on the platform and tracked the two siblings down, Xiono helped them fake their deaths to get the First Order off their trail. Eila and Kel were given sanctuary by the Chelidae, who offered to let them stay with them in engineering.[1]
            Later on, Eila began having repeated dreams of something attacking the Colossus. From experience, she and Kel knew she was dreaming of the future. When Vozo's newly-acquired pet Bibo found his way down to engineering, the children knew that Eila's dreams and what was coming to the Colossus were connected to Bibo. Vozo and Tamara Ryvora eventually arrived in search of the pet, and Eila and Kel returned Bibo, and told the two of her dreams. The dreams heralded the arrival of Bibo's mother, an enormous creature who was intent on retrieving her child.[3]
            After the First Order occupied the Colossus, Eila and her brother were fishing for snarlfish on the underside of the platform when their laughter was overheard by a patrolling stormtrooper, CS-515. Kel claimed that the two children had lost their identification, so CS-515 attempted to take them away, grabbing Eila by the wrist. Kel and Eila fought him, eventually knocking him unconscious. Aware that this could lead to trouble, they decided to go to Xiono for help. Although it was dangerous for them to be on the platform's upper levels, they went to Jarek Yeager's Repair Station, where Xiono and Jarek Yeager were eating lunch with Vozo and Ryvora. When Eila and Kel asked for help, Xiono called for Vozo and BB-8 to come along. He tried to talk Ryvora out of coming because she hadn't listened to his warnings about the First Order, but she insisted.[4]
            Eila and Kel led the Team Fireball members to where they had stashed the unconscious trooper in a closet, which prompted panic, as Xiono was concerned he could wake up and kill them all, while Ryvora thought they should turn themselves in. When CS-515 began to come to, Vozo knocked him out again with a wrench. Xiono made it clear they had to move CS-515 before other First Order personnel discovered him, and the group hauled him off to engineering. Eila and Kel stayed downstairs while Xiono hit upon the idea of impersonating the trooper both so that his absence wouldn't be missed and to ascertain if the trooper had reported the children's presence. While Xiono was upstairs, Ryvora panicked about Xiono's actions, and Eila and Kel called her out for trusting the First Order's word more than that of her friends, who were telling her about the Order's untrustworthiness. Ryvora was shocked when the siblings told her about why they had fled Tehar. When CS-515 woke up, groggy, Eila and Kel initially hid with Ryvora while Vozo dealt with the trooper. When he panicked upon seeing a Chelidae, Eila managed to calm him down, before Vozo shocked him unconscious again.[4]
            That evening, when Xiono contacted them and asked them to meet him with the unconscious CS-515, as Xiono was fleeing from the First Order after giving the stormtroopers the impression that "CS-515"'s mental conditioning was faulty, Eila, Kel, Ryvora, Vozo and BB-8 carried the unconscious trooper through the halls. When they encountered Namua, Ryvora told him that the unconscious man was sick and they were taking him to the medcentre. They hid in the maintenance ducts underneath the floor before Xiono arrived, and stayed there as CS-515 was dressed back up in his armour and propped up to be recovered by the other stormtroopers. Afterwards, Xiono told Eila and Kel they were safe for now as the trooper hadn't reported them, but that things were going to get much worse on the Colossus.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eila</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemEila</string></dict>

        <key>Jude Edivon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.91.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jude Edivon was a human female from Bespin who served as an officer in the Galactic Empire. She attended the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant and shared a room with Ciena Ree and Kendy Idele. After graduating from the Academy, Edivon was stationed aboard the first Death Star, where she discovered a critical weakness in the battle station's superstructure. During the Battle of Yavin, a Rebel pilot named Luke Skywalker exploited said flaw and destroyed the Death Star, killing her and everyone else aboard the battle station.
            A human female from the planet Bespin, Jude Edivon attended the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant, in the same class as  Ciena Ree, Thane Kyrell, Nash Windrider and Kendy Idele. She and her roommates Ciena and Kendy quickly took a liking to each other and became close friends. During her time at the Imperial Academy, she regularly went to target practice with Ciena and Kendy. On one such lesson, she praised Ciena's marksmanship.[1]
            Six months later, after a martial arts training session, Jude and her classmates Ciena and Kendy decided to visit the Museum of Multispecies Sciences to observe marine line. Knowing the close bond between Thane and Ciena, she advised Ciena not to become romantically involved due to the Academy's prohibition on romantic relationships among students. The following day, Jude and her fellow cadets had their improvised laser cannons examined by Commander Harn. This was part of a class project designed to test the cadets' mechanical skills and resourcefulness. When Harn examined Thane's laser cannon, he found that it had been sabotaged. After checking the door panel, Harn determined that Ciena was the culprit.[1]
            When Ciena was summoned to Commandant Deenlark's office for disciplining, Jude sprang to her friend's defense. Using her slicing skills, she examined the data logs and found evidence that Ciena had been framed after finding two levels of falsified data. Jude suspected that Thane was involved. Lacking strong evidence to convict or exonerate either party, Deenlark punished Ciena and Thane by failing their laser cannon assignments and downgrading their ranking in the class.[1]
            Later, Jude found that her earlier analysis had wrongfully implicated Thane. She summoned her two friends to a network terminal and discussed her new findings, which suggested that the Academy's Office of Student Outcomes had engineered the "laser cannon" incident. While Thane wanted to clear his and Ciena's names and to confront the authorities, Ciena believed that this was not a battle worth fighting over and that they should instead focus on their marks. A heated argument ensued between Thane and Ciena, which ended with Thane storming out of the room after Ciena likened him to his hated father. Jude comforted a distraught Ciena, and counselled her friend to focus on her marks and class ranking.[1]
            Two and a half years later, Jude was one of four top-achieving Imperial cadets, including Ciena, Thane, and Ved Foslo, who were invited to a ball at the Imperial Palace on Coruscant, which had formerly been the Jedi Temple during the time of the Galactic Republic. For that ball, she wore a tight-fitting orange fabric and gelled her hair into short spikes. Jude also spotted Princess Leia Organa, the junior senator of Alderaan and the adopted daughter of senator Bail Organa, an outspoken critic of Emperor Sheev Palpatine. While regarding the Organas' mercy missions as misguided, Jude thought they were acting out of a spirit of kindness.[1]
            After graduating from the academy, she was given the honor of serving aboard the Death Star. When the battle station obliterated Alderaan with its superlaser in a show of force, many of the young Imperials on the station felt conflicted. Jude struggled to rationalize the massacre, and superficially justified the action in the belief that it would prevent a much greater war in which countless more would die, though she knew this was a hollow reason.[1]
            Following these events, the Death Star closed in on the secret base of the Alliance to Restore the Republic on the fourth moon of Yavin. During the Battle of Yavin, Jude analyzed the attack and concluded that the Rebel fighters posed a threat to the station. She discovered the exhaust port no one else suspected to be a weakness[1] (a deliberate act of sabotage engineered by the station's designer Galen Walton Erso, who had been killed earlier that year)[3] and wrote to her superiors that though the chances were remote the consequences could be destructive or fatal to the station.[1] This report eventually reached General Moradmin Bast of the Joint Chiefs, who presented the information to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the man in overall command of the battle station. Tarkin, however, rejected Edivon's conclusion and chose to remain on the station instead of ordering an evacuation. But Edivon's and Bast's fears eventually proved right. Shortly afterwards, the Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker fired a pair of proton torpedoes by using the Force into the vulnerable exhaust port, which caused a chain reaction and destroyed the station. Jude, and the remaining personnel aboard the battle station, were all killed in the ensuing explosion.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jude_Edivon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJudeEdivon</string></dict>

        <key>Viqi Shesh</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.93.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Viqi Shesh was a female Human politician from the Kuat system who attained galactic infamy due to her collaboration with the invading Yuuzhan Vong species during the Yuuzhan Vong War. Obsessed with power, Shesh rose to prominence as the representative of Kuat in the New Republic Senate. When the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaded the New Republic in 25 ABY and inflicted heavy defeats upon the government and the military, Shesh soon decided that her best chances of survival lay with the winning side. Over a two year period, the Kuati senator passed vital information and military intelligence to Yuuzhan Vong spymasters with the intention of encouraging the invaders to spare Kuat and provide her with a position of power in their administration.
            A skilled politician, Shesh managed to secure herself the position of administrative senator for the Senate Select Committee for Refugees, whereupon she channeled millions of displaced persons to worlds she knew would be targeted by the Yuuzhan Vong, such as the planet Duro. When Warmaster Tsavong Lah, the military leader of the Yuuzhan Vong, came to spearhead the invasion, Shesh maintained personal contact with the fierce warrior, unaware that she was being used and was ultimately intended to be discarded. A vocal opponent of Master Luke Skywalker's Jedi Order, Shesh aided the warmaster in his vendetta against the Jedi by pushing for their exile from the New Republic and championing the betrayal of the Order to the invaders in return for peace.
            The full extent of the Kuati woman's collaboration with the Yuuzhan Vong went undiscovered and, although the suspicions of her colleague Leia Organa Solo led to Shesh's loss of her seat on the refugee committee, she remained prominent in the Senate, presenting herself as a rival to Bothan Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya. Warmaster Lah later promised Shesh the position of puppet Chief of State with the proviso that she arrange the assassination of Fey'lya. Shesh's attempt failed and she was soon thwarted in her efforts to divide the New Republic Senate by Luke Skywalker, who formed an alliance with Fey'lya and the New Republic military in opposition to her anti-Jedi policies.
            The Kuati politician was forced to turn to espionage and abduction to prove her worth to Tsavong Lah, becoming increasingly distanced from her life as a high profile senator. Under Lah's orders, Shesh targeted Han and Leia Organa Solo, as well as their nephew Ben Skywalker. A bungled attack on the Solo residence, however, resulted in the revelation of Shesh's identity as a Yuuzhan Vong spy to the New Republic and the Kuati politician was sent fleeing into Coruscant's underbelly. In a last gamble to appease the Yuuzhan Vong, Shesh attempted to kidnap Ben Skywalker while the warmaster's armada attacked and conquered Coruscant in 27 ABY.
            Shesh was foiled in her scheme shortly thereafter and was left with little choice but to present herself to the Yuuzhan Vong empty handed. Openly known as a traitor to the New Republic, Shesh was of no further use to Tsavong Lah and was sentenced to execution by the warmaster. Providing the warrior with advice in return for her continued survival, Shesh spent a short time acting as Lah's spymaster, directing Yuuzhan Vong agent Tam Elgrin to spy on a New Republic base on the planet Borleias before being dispatched to the ruined surface of Coruscant to hunt down Jedi alongside a team of Yuuzhan Vong warriors.
            The former senator spent the last days of her life clinging to survival, alternately pursued by a deranged Dark Jedi or monitored by Yuuzhan Vong warriors assigned to ensure her obedience to Tsavong Lah's directives. Traveling across Coruscant's despoiled cityscape in search for a means of escape, Shesh's chances were further complicated by the arrival of Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker, along with a New Republic insertion team. When she was finally outmaneuvered and confronted by her numerous enemies, Viqi Shesh chose to commit suicide, plummeting to her death in the shadows of Coruscanti buildings that she had helped to topple.
            Viqi Shesh was born into a wealthy shipbuilding family on the prosperous world of Kuat,[7] a planet famed for its shipyard industries.[8] Shesh's opulent lifestyle ensured that the Human woman became used to the trappings of luxury and her upbringing led her to believe that power was her birthright.[1][7] The Shesh family, in whose veins ran the blood of Kuati royalty,[3] had strong ties to Kuat Drive Yards. Their heavy involvement with the shipbuilding industry brought tribulation, however, when the head of Kuat Drive Yards, Kuat of Kuat, committed suicide in 4 ABY,[1] destroying 20% of the planet's orbital shipyards in the process.[9]
            During the subsequent reconstruction efforts, Shesh's family lost social and political status and turned to the New Republic, secretly forging ties with the new government,[1] which installed itself on Coruscant in 6.5 ABY. By the time the New Republic wrested Kuat and its shipyards from the Galactic Empire in 8.5 ABY,[2] the Shesh family's secret betrayal of Imperial interests reaped vast dividends. Deluged with offers from eager clients affiliated with the New Republic, the Shesh family became accustomed to contracts worth upwards of a billion credits. The young Viqi Shesh was able to find a job in Kuati corporate marketing and, despite her indifference toward the work, learned much about society and how beings could be manipulated by their fears and hopes. Ultimately, however, Shesh's apathy with her corporate post encouraged her to seek a career in the public sector. She desired power and influence and had the ambition and resources to attain both.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Viqi_Shesh</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemViqiShesh</string></dict>
        <key>Jylia Shale</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.94.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jylia Shale was a high ranking officer and legendary strategist in the Galactic Empire's army, holding the position of general. Several months after the Battle of Endor, Shale attended a secret summit on Akiva called by Admiral Rae Sloane. Shale held the opinion that the Empire would not be able to win and that they should surrender to the New Republic in order to survive. The New Republic attacked the Star Destroyers above Akiva and as a result, she was captured along with Yupe Tashu.
            During the reign of the Galactic Empire, General Jylia Shale was a skilled strategist and tactician in the Imperial Army. Following the Battle of Endor, she traveled to the planet Akiva on the Imperial Star Destroyer Ascent to attend an emergency summit called the Imperial Future Council to discuss the future of the Empire. Other delegates included Admiral Rae Sloane, the self-proclaimed Grand Moff Valco Pandion, the former Imperial Adviser Yupe Tashu, and the Imperial financier and slave trafficker Arsin Crassus. General Shale and her fellow delegates landed at the Satrap's Palace in the capital city Myrra where they were hosted by Satrap Isstra Dirus. She traveled in a Lambda-class shuttle and was accompanied by two of the Emperor's Royal Guard.[2]
            After landing, Shale and her fellow delegates were spotted by the Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari, who was working for the New Republic, the successor to the Rebel Alliance. Jas however was attacked by Sloane's shuttle and was captured by the Sullustan crime lord Surat Nuat. Shale attended a banquet where she suggested that the New Republic's propaganda was not completely false and that the Empire was lying to themselves. She also expressed concern about the safety of the emergency summit after learning that Sloane had captured the New Republic starfighter pilot Wedge Antilles.[2]
            When the Imperial Future Council learned that Imperial forces had shot down two New Republic A-wings, Shale disagreed with Grand Moff Pandion's plan to dispatch the Imperial Navy's last Super Star Destroyer Ravager to Akiva to reassert Imperial military power. Shale argued that the Empire was not ready to fight the rebellion and likened the Galactic Civil War to a game of chatta-ragul. Shale theorized that the New Republic Grand Admiral Ackbar would not send a military force to Akiva but would instead send a drone ship. In the light of the Imperial losses since Endor, Shale urged her comrades not to waste more Imperial resources and manpower. She and the majority of the delegates voted to move the Star Destroyers into hyperspace despite the protests of Crassus and Pandion.[2]
            As the meeting dragged on, Shale disagreed with Crassus' recommendation that they plunder the Imperial coffers in order to bribe the galactic populace. She feared that plundering the InterGalactic Banking Clan's coffers would plunge the galaxy into a recession. Shale was also skeptical of Crassus' idea that the Empire establish a truce with the New Republic. Shale argued that the New Republic was not in a mood for peace with the Empire and that they were more interested in trying Imperial leaders as war criminals. Shale also criticized the Emperor's Death Stars as a colossal waste of resources and slammed the Emperor for his arrogance. Shale's remarks unnerved the Imperial advisor Tashu.[2]
            Shale also disagreed with Pandion's view that the rebels were terrorist and criminals and argued that they were motivated by legitimate grievances towards the Empire including oppression, the enslavement of alien species, and the Death Stars. When Pandion responded that her remarks were worthy of death, Shale responded that the Empire had become executioners. Lacking a meaningful strategy, she suggested that the Imperials surrender to the New Republic. Shale and the others listened when Tashu recommended that the remnants of the Empire flee to the Unknown Regions and find the source of the dark side.[2]
            Later, Shale and Pandion argued about marshaling Imperial ships above Akiva. She advised against deploying Imperial ships there in order to avoid losing more ships to the New Republic. When Pandion attacked her for cowardice, she pointed out that Pandion had abandoned his men on a communications station on Malastare when the battle was turning against the Empire. Admiral Sloane then intervened and reminded the delegates that the purpose of their meeting was to discuss the future of the Empire rather than squabble.[2]
            After the New Republic pilot Norra Wexley and her motley rebel stand stirred up a popular uprising in Myrra, Shale and the other Imperials made preparations to flee the planet. Since their shuttles had been destroyed by Norra, Sloane decided to commandeer Crassus' pleasure craft Golden Harp for the Imperial Future Council. Shale and her fellow Imperials were joined by Norra and her associates Jas Emari and the former Imperial Security Bureau officer Sinjir Rath Velus, who had been captured while trying to breach the palace. Their flight back to the Imperial command ships coincided with a New Republic naval attack on Akiva.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jylia_Shale</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJyliaShale</string></dict>
        <key>Satele Shan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.95.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Satele Shan was a Human female who served as the Jedi Order's Grand Master during the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. The daughter of Jedi Knight Tasiele Shan, who was herself a descendant of the legendary Jedi Knights Revan and Bastila Shan, Satele was born on the planet Brentaal IV in the year 3699 BBY. Inheriting her family's Force-sensitivity, she was inducted into the Jedi Order and became the Padawan of Jedi Master Ngani Zho, though she later traveled to the Sith homeworld of Korriban to study under the Zabrak Battlemaster Kao Cen Darach. It was there that she witnessed the recapture of the planet by the Sith Empire in 3681 BBY, and she escaped to warn the Republic with the help of the smuggler Nico Okarr and a Republic trooper named Jace Malcom at the cost of Darach's life.
            Achieving the rank of Jedi Knight under the tutelage of Master Dar'Nala, Shan led her fellow Jedi and the forces of the Republic Military into battle in the Great Galactic War, becoming a well-known hero to the Republic. Shan also grew close with Malcom despite the Jedi Order's restrictions on attachments, and their bond drove her to rescue Malcom and his small band of Special Forces troopers on the Core World of Alderaan when the Empire invaded the world in 3667 BBY. Her arrival turned the tide of the Battle of Alderaan in the Republic's favor. After defeating the Sith Lord Darth Malgus in combat with the help of Malcom, she and Malcom began an affair that lasted for six months before Shan broke it off in fear of the darkness in the soldier's heart. However, she was pregnant with Malcom's child, and Shan eventually gave birth to her son, Theron, in secret with the help of Master Zho before giving the child up to the Jedi Order and returning to the battlefield.
            In 3653 BBY, Shan was selected to be part of the delegation that was to attend peace talks with the Sith Empire on Alderaan. However, the Empire used the conference as a distraction while it attacked the Republic's capital of Coruscant, holding the world hostage to force the Republic to accept the terms of the Treaty of Coruscant. As the galaxy settled into an uneasy Cold War, Shan foiled a conspiracy to sabotage the new peace perpetrated by Dar'Nala herself and afterward embarked on an odyssey inspired by the call of the Force across the galaxy. The journey led her to the Jedi Order's long-lost homeworld of Tython in the Deep Core, and for her rediscovery of the planet, Shan was appointed to the position of Grand Master and given leadership of the entire Order. In her new role, Shan guided the Order through a number of crises that arose during the Cold War also and trained her Kiffar Padawan, Shigar Konshi, to Knighthood.
            As the fragile calm of the Cold War began to collapse, Shan worked with the Republic Emergency Response Corps to protect the unsteady peace and the innocents of the galaxy, and she was alerted to a dangerous threat from the Sith Emperor by his former servant Lord Scourge when a daring mission that she had authorized to capture the Emperor ended in disaster. Learning that the Emperor intended to extinguish all life in the galaxy, Shan helped the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython foil the Emperor's plans and personally led an invasion fleet in an assault on the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas while the Knight confronted and defeated the Emperor. As the renewed war continued to spread across the galaxy, Shan worked with her former flame, Malcom, in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the Republic Military, and the two achieved victory over the prototype Imperial warship Ascendant Spear at Duro thanks to the efforts of their son, Theron. Shan also forged a temporary truce with the Empire's Darth Marr in order to combat the threat of the Order of Revan, and the two led their combined forces in defeating the returned Revan on the moon Yavin 4. After the Eternal Empire conquered the Republic and Sith Empire, Shan was disheartened by the casualties the Jedi Order suffered under her command and renounced her title, going into a meditative exile with the spirit of the Sith Darth Marr.
            Satele Shan was born in the year 3699 BBY to the Human Jedi Knight Tasiele Shan, who was the descendant of the legendary Jedi Revan and Bastila Shan. Born on Brentaal IV, Shan was recruited into the Jedi Order like her mother, though Tasiele was the subject of a political controversy not long after her daughter's birth—Shan's controversial belief that one could draw strength from attachment alarmed the Galactic Republic, which feared that she would fall to the dark side of the Force like her famous ancestor Revan. The Republic pressured the Order into exiling Tasiele to an uninhabited planet in the Outer Rim Territories. When the political controversy eventually died down, the Order attempted to retrieve the Jedi Knight, but Tasiele was nowhere to be found—the only thing the Order could locate in Tasiele's abandoned dwelling was a series of journals written to Satele, which it delivered to the missing Jedi's daughter.[1] Apprenticed to Jedi Master Ngani Zho, Shan studied the ways of the Force as a Padawan[5] until 3681 BBY, when she traveled to the Republic's space station in orbit of the Sith homeworld of Korriban to study under the Order's Battlemaster, Kao Cen Darach.[8] Under Darach's tutelage, Shan learned how to wield and fight with the blue double-bladed lightsaber that she constructed for herself. He also guided the Padawan through some of the Jedi Trials,[1] though her ascension to Knighthood was not completed by the end of that year. The reconstituted Sith Empire soon began attacking the edges of the Republic, instigating the Great Galactic War.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Satele_Shan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSateleShan</string></dict>
        <key>Falthina Sharest</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.96.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Falthina Sharest was a human female emigration officer in the Corellian Security Forces. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, CorSec became an extension of the Imperial forces on Corellia, and she served as Lead Transport Security Officer in Coronet Spaceport.
            Falthina Sharest had at least one sibling, a sister.[2] By 13 BBY,[3] Sharest worked in Coronet Spaceport booth at the planet Corellia. Her work consisted on opening security gates to travelers to let them depart from Corellia or visit it.[4] Sharest hated her job because, as her grandmother used to say, it was as dull as an old milk knife.[4] She dreamed to leave Corellia in order to visit other planets, only coming back to Corellia to visit her sister.[4]
            One day, two criminals known as Han and Qi'ra approached and offered to bribe her with a vial of coaxium in exchange for passage through the security gate. While Sharest mentioned that they could be arrested for just having the vial, Han replied that it would not do anyone good then. She agreed to allow them through, provided they handed the coaxium over prior to the gate being opened. Qi'ra did not agree to this, and instead suggested a simultaneous exchange. However, because the White Worms gang members were approaching, Han encouraged her to hand it over. Qi'ra gave up the coaxium, and Sharest opened the gate. However, as Han passed through, Qi'ra was grabbed by members of the White Worms gang led by the Grindalid thug Moloch.[4]
            Meanwhile, Sharest took the opportunity to issue a security alert; this action promptly broke her agreement to let the young couple pass quietly. Officer Sharest then locked down the gate which separated Han and Qi'ra. Despite Han's pleas for her to open the passage again, she ignored him and continued to alert the spaceport staff about an unauthorized traveler.[4]
            Falthina Sharest was a human female who stood 1.63 meters tall[5] and had brown eyes. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Sharest had dark hair.[4] A Lead Transport Security Officer in Coronet Spaceport, Sharest seized and sometimes accepted contraband from unlucky and foolish travelers if its value meant a big payday for her, such as when Han and Qi'ra brought her a vial of valuable coaxium,[5] given that she hated her job.[2]
            Sharest's personality changed depending in the circumstances. She showed concern when Han and Qi'ra bribed her with a vial of coaxium, as they could have been detained for having it. She opened the gates out of Corellia for them, but when Moloch and the White Worms began to drag Qi'ra to their den to make her pay for her treason, Sharest apathetically left the young woman to her fate and closed the door, reporting that Qi'ra was an unauthorized traveler and ignoring Han's pleas to reopen the gate.[4] Despite these negative traits, Sharest wasn't uncaring at all, as at least she loved her family, planning to depart Corellia to explore the galaxy but only coming back to visit her sister.[2]
            Falthina Sharest was portrayed by Anna Francolini in the 2018 Star Wars Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story[6] and was first identified in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.[1]
            In the first issue of the Marvel Comics' comic book adaptation of the film, Sharest's dialogue is shortened and she doesn't express concern for Han and Qi'ra nor does she report Qi'ra to the spaceport's authorities as an unauthorized traveler.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Falthina_Sharest</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemFalthinaSharest</string></dict>
        <key>Shara  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.97.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shara was a human female member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. She served as a rebel trooper that, along with a blaster rifle, packed a missile launcher while on missions.
            Shara was a human female who joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic[1] by the year 0 BBY.[2] She served as a rebel trooper that was known to carry a missile launcher along with her other gear while on missions. During the Galactic Civil War against the Galactic Empire, Shara may have undergone a variety of missions on the behalf of the Alliance centered on the planet Jedha, and may have also participated in the battle on the planet Scarif.[1]
            Shara was a light-skinned human with brown hair and eyes.[1]
            As a rebel trooper, Shara wore the uniform of a soldier, which included an eared-hat with goggles and a small radio-esque device. Along with her blaster rifle, Shara carried a missile launcher into battle that could deal extensive damage to her targets.[1]
            Shara was created for the online browser video game Star Wars: Boots on the Ground, and was one of four playable characters—alongside Cassian Andor, K-2SO, and Borvo—that the player could use at the start of the game. Shara could be selected as a member of the player's squad and be taken on missions.[1]
            Given the freedom that the player has in creating their squad, there is no certainty as to what missions and battles in the game, if any, Shara actually participated in.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shara_(rebel)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemShara</string></dict>
        <key>Helena Shan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.98.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Helena Shan was the mother of the Jedi Bastila Shan and the wife of a treasure hunter.
            When Bastila Shan was a child and her father wanted to take her searching for treasure, as he regularly did, it was Helena who prevented him, insisting that it was too dangerous. Bastila thought her mother urged her father to go on hunts. As a result, Bastila grew up resentful of her mother, and the two of them had an uneasy relationship. When Helena sent Bastila to join the Jedi Order to provide her with a better life than that of the daughter of treasure hunters, Bastila took that as a sign that her mother did not want her around.
            Over the following years, Helena and her husband continued their treasure hunting. Helena remembered her daughter with fondness, showing holograms of her to one of her husband's employees, a Twi'lek woman named Malare. At some point during this time, Helena developed a fatal disease. Her husband, in order to pay for treatments, desperately continued his search for treasure to raise the money. In the course of these hunts he traveled to Tatooine searching for krayt dragon pearls, and was killed by a canyon krayt dragon in the Eastern Dune Sea. When Helena spoke to Malare again, she was desperate to find her daughter.
            During the Jedi Civil War in 3956 BBY, as Bastila and Jedi Padawan Revan traveled to Tatooine during their journey to find a way to stop the Sith Invasion, Malare would cross paths with her and her companion, informing them that Helena was on Tatooine looking for Bastila. Helena's attitude had raised the ire of several patrons of the Anchorhead cantina, including the Duros Maana Demknot, who stormed out just as Bastila and the amnesiac Revan arrived, and was able to direct them to her. Bastila reluctantly met with Helena, but doubted that she was truly ill, and after a brief argument learned of her father's death. Helena asked Bastila to retrieve a holocron belonging to Bastila's father from the krayt dragon's lair. After slaying the dragon, the two Jedi retrieved it, but Bastila was reluctant to give it back to her mother. When she learned that Helena truly was dying and righted her misconceptions about her childhood, Bastila reconciled with Helena and gave her 500 credits to pay for treatment from a doctor on Coruscant. Before she left the Cantina, Helena asked Revan to protect and take care of Bastila. He told her that he would do his best.
            Strangely enough, Helena herself is wearing Jedi robes. This could either be a mistake on the part of BioWare, or reflective of the simple nature of some forms of Jedi robes from that period in time, and their similarity to simple desert robes. Her portrait is also a generic Human female seen in many parts of the game. With the robes she resembles many Jedi females at the ceremony on Lehon, albeit she has an older face.
            In the game, there is another alternative possibility where Bastila does not give the holocron of her father to Helena and keeps it for herself. Bastila is not convinced that her mother is ill, and therefore does not give her credits to find a doctor on Coruscant, with the confrontation between the two ending on bad terms.
            Helena Shan was voiced by Carolyn Seymour.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Helena_Shan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemHelenaShan</string></dict>
        <key>Shara Jenn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.99.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shara Jenn, codenamed Watcher Two and later Keeper, was an Intelligence Operative of the Sith Empire.
            Jenn was raised within an Imperial facility, and placed in a program designed to fine-tune her cognitive abilities. She was granted Watcher designation after being highly evaluated during initial operations. She handled liaisons between Cipher Nine and HQ, frequently contacting Nine in the field with information and mission details.
            In 3643 BBY, Shara aided Nine in tracking down and dismantling the Eagle terrorist network. Following the elimination of the terrorists' Alderaan financiers, Shara was able to locate the Eagle on Nal Hutta, enabling Nine to kill the terrorist. However, the crisis was not over, for they still had the issue of the terrorist's bio-mechanical superweapons, the Eradicators, to deal with. Shara joined in a closed meeting with Keeper and Nine to discuss the Eradicators. Nine had obtained one-half of the command codes but unless both halves are inputted to stop the Eradicators, they would fire indiscriminately over the Imperial worlds they were stationed over. Luckily, Intelligence, caught a break, determining that the Eagle's Imperial patron was hiding in the Artus system. Keeper provided Nine and Shara cloaking devices for their ships that would only last one hyperspace jump so they could board the dreadnaught where they could stop the Eradicators. Once onboard, Shara remained aboard her ship to monitor Nine's progress as the agent made it to the bridge, where they discovered that Darth Jadus was alive. Jadus was the true power behind the terrorists and had faked his death so he could escape the eyes of the Dark Council. Now he planned on using the Eradicators to target the strongholds of his rivals, after which he would dominate the Empire. With Jadus putting up a jamming field preventing Shara from calling for reinforcements, she suggested to Nine that they activate the Eradicators, distracting Jadus so that they could encase him in ray shields.
            In 3642 BBY, after Darth Jadus' defeat, and thanks to Cipher 9's contributions, Jenn was promoted to the position of the spymaster Keeper, whereas the latter became the new Minister of Intelligence. After the search for Darth Jadus was halted, because of the start of the Galactic War, Shara assigned Cipher Nine to take on the best agent the Republic's Intelligence had to offer, spymaster Ardun Kothe. From what her sources could tell, Kothe was granted autonomy by the Senate and Intelligence wants to know what he's up to, so she sends in Nine as a double agent. Unbeknownst to Shara, Kothe had somehow obtained Nine's brainwashing code, forcing the agent to do his bidding and leaving Nine unable to tell Shara about what's happened.
            Shara later contacted Nine after the agent's clash with Admiral Layek Davos and an unconfirmed blackout at HQ. Nine claimed that was it was to maintain their cover. Shara reiterates the agent's mission to find out what the SIS is up to and then eliminate Kothe. Later, Shara got in contact with the Cipher Agent again after receiving reports of an Imperial bombing run on Quesh. Nine, having secretly broken free of the brainwashing, reports that Kothe and his weapon, the Shadow Arsenal, had been eliminated. Shara then recalled Nine back to Dromund Kaas for a meeting with the Minister of Intelligence.
            Following the meeting with the Minister, Cipher Nine was sent to Isen IV investigating the appearance of Hunter, the only surviving member of Kothe's team. Nine's investigation had turned up that Hunter had used some sort of unknown technology to hijack the colony's machinery and turn them against the colonists, in an attempt to frame the Empire for the massacre. Shara began researching a number of unresolved Intelligence cases, determining that Hunter is working for a third party unaffiliated with Empire or Republic and had been manipulated events since before the Empire returned to the galaxy. She then brought up data on Operation Morning Crest, which included an audio recording of Hunter and his unidentified superior, detailing the ghost agent's infiltration of the SIS.
            Nine then decided to take on the task of uncovering this conspiracy. By the time the agent had returned to their ship, the Watchers had complied a lead on Belsavis. Along with Watcher Three, Shara explained that the conspiracy had created Megasecurity Ward 23, mostly likely to hide something. She instructed the agent to masquerade as a criminal and enlist a select number of inmates to assist in breaching Megasecurity.
            After Nine had acquired the services of SCORPIO, Shara then dispatched the agent to the Tytun Rings HoloNet archives, suspecting that the conspirators, identified as the Star Cabal, had constructed the archives to hide their communications. With the aid of the new Watchers, Nine managed to extract data fragments and brought them back to HQ to be reassembled. As they watched the holorecording of Hunter and his unidentified cohorts discussing a grand, yet risky, plan, a trap within the recording designed to overwhelm a genetically enhanced mind rendered Shara and the other enhanced Watchers comatose, effectively crippling Intelligence's operations and starting the downfall of the organization. However, this did not deterred Cipher Nine, who went to investigate another lead on Voss that Shara had found.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shara_Jenn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSharaJenn</string></dict>
        <key>Bastila Shan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.100.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bastila Shan was a Human female who served as a Jedi Padawan during the Jedi Civil War. Born on the planet Talravin to Helena Shan and a treasure hunter, her mother gave her up to the Jedi Order, believing that their lifestyle of travel and exertions was not suitable for her daughter. Shan was found to have an exceptional gift with a Force power known as battle meditation; which increased her allies' morale while demoralizing her enemies. Shan sided with the Jedi Council when the Jedi Knights Revan and Malak rebelled against the Council and joined the Galactic Republic in its war against the invading Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders.
            One year after the final battle of the Mandalorian Wars, Revan returned from the Unknown Regions as the new Dark Lord of the Sith, with Malak as his apprentice, at the head of a new Sith Empire. Two years into the Jedi Civil War, Shan was the leader of a Jedi strike team sent to capture Darth Revan and Darth Malak. When her team boarded Revan's vessel, they managed to corner the Dark Lord on the bridge. Before they could engage Revan in combat, Malak, who was separated from his Master during the battle, betrayed Revan by ordering the guns of his flagship Leviathan to fire on Revan's vessel in an attempt to destroy both the Jedi and Revan.
            However, Shan survived and managed to use the Force to stabilize Revan, who was near death. This act created a bond between the two and Shan brought the comatose Revan to the Jedi Council. Both the Council and Shan came up with a plan and temporarily erased Revan's memories, reprogramming Revan with an identity of a soldier loyal to the Republic. The Council hoped that Shan, through her bond with Revan, would be able to coerce Revan into revealing the location of the Rakatan space station called the Star Forge, which was now under the new Dark Lord Darth Malak's control.
            In the final year of the war, Shan's Republic warship Endar Spire was ambushed and attacked by Malak's fleet above the Outer Rim planet Taris. She managed to flee the ship aboard one of its escape pods, assisted by Republic commander Carth Onasi. Shortly after her pod reached the surface, Shan was captured by a swoop gang known as the Black Vulkars. After Revan and Onasi landed on Taris, they managed to track down and rescue Shan. She, Revan, and their companions teamed up with the Mandalorian Canderous Ordo, managing to steal both the launch codes necessary to escape Taris and the Exchange crime lord Davik Kang's light freighter Ebon Hawk, killing Davik and nearly doing the same to Calo Nord, who Revan, Bastila and one of their companions would later kill on Kashyyyk. Shan and her companions escaped during the Sith's bombardment of Taris, and headed to Dantooine, where a Jedi Enclave was located.
            After Shan met with the Dantooine Jedi Council, they began retraining Revan in the Jedi ways. After finding a Rakatan Star Map in the burial mounds near the Enclave, the Council tasked Shan, Revan, and their companions with finding the Star Forge. During their travels, Shan watched Revan closely to ensure that he did not fall to the dark side. Shan eventually fell in love with Revan, who, despite his past, was able to remain true to the Jedi Code. After Revan found a fourth Star Map—which was necessary to locate the Star Forge—Shan was captured by Malak and fell to the dark side after a week of torture at her new Sith Master's hands.
            However, Revan eventually confronted Shan aboard the Star Forge and she was redeemed from the darkness to which she had succumbed. To prove her reclaimed faith, Shan aided the Republic in the Battle of Rakata Prime through the means of her battle meditation. Revan then vanquished Malak, and the Republic fleet successfully destroyed the Star Forge, routing the Sith forces. Sometime after this, Shan and Revan married, and started a new life together. However, within the next two years, Revan left for the Unknown Regions, seeking to eliminate a hidden Sith threat that Revan had discovered during his time as the Dark Lord. He left all whom he cared for behind, including Shan due to her pregnancy, as he did not wish to put the life of their child at risk. She went on to survive the era of strife that followed the Jedi Civil War.
            Bastila Shan, daughter of Helena Shan and a hunter, was born on Talravin. Shan shared a loving and powerful relationship with her father. Despite this relationship, she was not on good terms with her mother, Helena, believing that her mother pushed her father into dangerous hunts so they could live in wealth.[3]
            As a child, Shan was discovered to be exceptionally gifted with the Force.[5] She did not wish to leave her father behind and join the Jedi Order, but her mother felt that the life she and her family led —one full of relentless travel and fruitless exertions— was not a good life for Shan. She believed that her daughter's life would be better with the Jedi and gave her to them. Shan was separated from her family and began her training, quickly proving to be an exceptional Jedi Sentinel.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bastila_Shan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBastilaShan</string></dict>

            Shaleena was born and raised in the Undercity, and had never seen the sky. As a child, she was enchanted with the tales of Rukil, but eventually became disillusioned with his beliefs in the Promised Land. She still respected him though, as she did Gendar. She tried to maintain a decent standard of behavior amongst her fellow villagers, and chided those who resorted to begging and mugging. She was friendly to strangers, longing to hear tales of the Upper City especially.[1]

        <key>Ta'a Chume</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.102.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ta'a Chume was the Queen Mother of the Hapes Consortium during the first part of the Galactic Civil War, the mother of Isolder, and the grandmother of Tenel Ka Djo. As the ruler of the Hapes Consortium, she was responsible for opening up the borders of the Hapes Cluster to the rest of the galaxy in 8 ABY.
            As a ruler concerned only with her position, Ta'a Chume had no qualms about killing people to protect herself and/or the monarchy, including going so far as to arrange the assassinations of her first born son, her younger son's fiancée, and her daughter-in-law. Despite being placed under house arrest for the murder of the latter, she had arranged an assassination attempt on her newborn great-granddaughter Allana in 36 ABY. In retaliation, Jacen Solo, Allana's father, used the Force to give her a brain hemorrhage that sent her into a coma.
            Ta'a Chume was the daughter of Ni'Korish, and had the company of several sisters while growing up.[3] Details of her early life are scarce, but it was known that Ni'Korish's hatred of the Jedi was a large influence on her.[3][2]
            Upon the death of her mother, Ta'a Chume became the Queen Mother, the absolute monarch of the Hapes Consortium. She took a consort, and they had two sons, Kalen and Isolder. Her consort died while their children were still young.[3]
            During her reign as the ruler of the Hapes Consortium, Ta'a Chume ruled with an iron fist and advocated a large military presence, mainly due to the fact that the Galactic Empire had made several attempts to invade the Hapes Cluster. Due to the large navy she had assembled to counter these intrusions, most of the attacks were repelled.[3]
            In 2 ABY, Ta'a Chume had decided that her older son Kalen lacked the necessary skills to be a leader to his people, so she had arranged for his kidnapping and murder by pirates near the Terephon system. This event prompted her younger son Isolder to go undercover as a privateer for two years to search for those responsible.[3][4]
            Impressed by Isolder's resolve, Ta'a Chume named him the new Chume'da. When Isolder became engaged to a Hapan noble named Elliar shortly afterward, Ta'a Chume was less than thrilled. Feeling that Elliar's pacifism would be the ruin of the Hapes Consortium, she arranged for Elliar's drowning death in one of Hapes' reflecting pools. It would not be until years later that Isolder would discover that his mother was behind both deaths.[3][4]
            In 8 ABY, Leia Organa visited Ta'a Chume on Hapes in a bid to forge a Hapan/New Republic alliance.[5] While Organa was discussing details with Ta'a Chume, Isolder spotted Organa from afar and fell in love with her. He went to Ta'a Chume to discuss permission for him to marry Organa, which she only granted to ensure his loyalty to her. In truth, she despised Organa's ideals and maintained the illusion of an alliance for Isolder's benefit.[3]
            When the Hapan fleet arrived at Coruscant in 8 ABY to confirm the alliance proposal, each of the Hapan worlds presented a gift to Organa, with the gift from Hapes itself being Isolder's marriage proposal. While mulling over the proposal, Organa was targeted by Hapan assassins working on Ta'a Chume's orders. The plot was foiled by Isolder, but before Ta'a Chume could arrange another attempt, Han Solo kidnapped Organa and took her to Dathomir in an effort to win her love. Because a Hapan honor tradition dictated that the Queen Mother do anything possible to protect her successor, Ta'a Chume put her network of spies to use to find Solo and have him executed.[3]
            When a lead was located, Ta'a Chume sent her spies to question Omogg, a Drackmarian warlord who was one of last people Solo had associated with. Determined to get the information one way or another, she had some of her other spies run a check on Omogg's navicomp before questioning her. Due to the huge bounty posted on Solo's head that she wanted to claim for herself, Omogg refused to give Ta'a Chume's spies any details, so in frustration they assaulted her. To gain the Drackmarian's trust, Ta'a Chume asked Omogg what punishment she should dole out to her errant underlings, and was told by Omogg to make them breathe methane. Ta'a Chume agreed, hoping to get information on Solo in return, but the Drackmarian refused, only agreeing to give the information to Luke Skywalker. Although slightly put off, she still had the information from the navicomp sweep she had her spies perform earlier, and used it to dispatch the Hapan fleet to Dathomir.[3]
            Intrigued by Skywalker, she invited him to dine with her and Isolder aboard Star Home. While dining, she tried her best to seduce him and told him a lie about a small Jedi academy that was set up on Reboam during the Great Jedi Purge. Skywalker sensed that she did not have his best interests at heart when divulging that detail, however, and he and Isolder departed Star Home for Dathomir.[3]
            Ta'a Chume and the Hapan fleet arrived at Dathomir during the Battle of Dathomir, and helped New Republic forces defeat Warlord Zsinj. Afterward, while on Dathomir for a victory celebration, Isolder announced his intention to make one of the local Witches of Dathomir, Teneniel Djo, his bride. Ta'a Chume was horrified that a Force-sensitive commoner from a backwater planet would succeed her, and objected to the union. However, Djo used the Force on her, assuring her that she was no pacifist and had no qualms about executing the Queen Mother if the situation warranted it. Ta'a Chume backed down and allowed the union, although there was no love lost between her and her new daughter-in-law.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ta%27a_Chume</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTa'aChume</string></dict>

Emess was younger than Vaner, who had been born in 3954 BBY, and Vaner's mother initially disapproved of their relationship on account of her age. By 3900 BBY, Emess had a son named Bress and a younger daughter named Reesa, both of whom were Force-sensitive, and her husband was running for Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. On the anniversary of Bastila's marriage to Revan, Emess and her children accompanied Vaner when he visited his mother, and Emess put her children to bed at the end of the day while Vaner spoke with Bastila.[1]

        <key>Thracia Cho Leem</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.105.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Thracia Cho Leem was a female Human Jedi Master serving in the Jedi Order in the waning years of the Galactic Republic. While not always agreeing with their choices, Master Leem maintained a good relationship with Jedi High Council member Mace Windu; one of her most prominent Padawans was the Fosh Jedi Vergere.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Thracia Cho Leem was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order; eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master. After achieving the rank of Knight, Leem undertook independent study as a Jedi Consular, becoming a renowned healer and well respected by many of her peers. A contemporary of Mace Windu, she was one of his few close friends who could make him smile heartily. Their friendship was maintained despite Leem's unorthodox lifestyle and her disregard for formality or finesse.[2]
            Indeed, Master Leem was somewhat of a rogue. Taking predominantly female Padawans, the diminutive woman roamed the galaxy, returning very rarely to the Coruscant Jedi Temple. In fact, Master Leem violated the Jedi Code's ban on attachments frequently, marrying several times and giving birth to sons and daughters on several worlds. Despite this, Leem never received censure from the High Council; the august body continued to allow her to teach apprentices and carry her lightsaber.[2]
            One of Master Leem's most prized Padawans was the Fosh Jedi Vergere. Having been with Vergere the moment she hatched, Leem took the avian as her apprentice and raised her to the rank of Knight. Therefore, when Vergere did not report back after departing for Zonama Sekot in 29 BBY, Master Leem petitioned the High Council to dispatch a rescue team to find her wayward apprentice. Assigning Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and his young Padawan Anakin Skywalker, the team searched for evidence of Vergere on the planet. When the two returned to Coruscant, they concluded that Vergere had been taken by beings known as the Far Outsiders and that she was beyond the Order's reach. Not long after, Master Leem left the Order without stating her reasons, this time for good. Maintaining contact with the Temple, Leem no longer served the Republic, but the Force.
            Though she left the Jedi Order as a Master, Thracia Cho Leem is not considered a member of the Lost Twenty.[3]
            The Power of the Jedi Sourcebook identifies her surname as "Cho Leem", while the newer source Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force has it simply as "Leem".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thracia_Cho_Leem</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemThraciaChoLeem</string></dict>
        <key>Chanath Cha</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.106.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Chanath Cha was a human female bounty hunter who operated during the Galactic Civil War.
            On Cabarria, Chanath Cha together with her mother Ramat and father Bhada had been paid to kill Darth Vader. Tricking Vader that a Jedi had been seen in a bar, the family sat ready to kill him when he entered. Using ion grenades, they neutralized all the weapons in the bar while Chanath tried to seize Vader's lightsaber with a tractor rifle. However, he used the Force to seize the lightsaber midair and, under the strain of the two opposing forces, the hilt shattered, leaving only the red kyber crystal. Realizing they stood no match against the Sith Lord they activated their shields and fled the bar.[2]
            All three got on a speeder bike and proceeded to escape. Vader followed them on his own speeder and when they tried to blast them, he easily deflected their bolts. They proved to be capable to keep away from him for a time until he crashed a massive vehicle in their path, causing their speeder to crash. Seizing Chanath in a Force choke, he requested they tell him who had ordered his death. They told him about an anonymous bounty with an exhorbitant price posted on the hunter net. Ramat, a talented slicer, offered to uncover their employer for him in exchange for their daughter's life. When they demanded that he release Chanath first, Vader refused and threatened to kill them all. However, the Cha's countered that, even in death, they would be together so he could not threaten them with such tactics. Grudgingly impressed, the Dark Lord demanded proof that Ramat could deliver her side of the deal, which she proved by tracking the signal of the bounty back to Coruscant. Chanath was released as agreed, at which point the bounty hunters made their daughter swear that she would seek no vengeance against the Dark Lord, a deal Vader chose to honor. To complete the deal, Ramat provided Vader with the information he had requested and gave him the source of the bounty on him: the highest levels of the Republic Executive Building on Coruscant.[2]
            Cha continued to work as a prestigious bounty hunter during the Galactic Civil War that occurred during the reign of the Galactic Empire. She had a past romantic history with Lobot with some tension between them due to Lobot's decision to work with Lando Calrissian.[1]
            Shortly after Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra was captured by the Rebel Alliance on Vrogas Vas, Cha was one of several bounty hunters hired by Darth Vader to return Aphra to him.[4]
            Sometime later, Cha was hired by an enemy of the crime boss Big String—who resided in a volcanic fortress on the Inner Rim world Amethia Prime—to destroy his fortress and apprehend String. Soon, Cha traveled to the ocean world and invaded the fortress, flying through its structure and destroying it using near-indestructible armor and rocket boots, until the entire complex went up in an explosive fireball. Then Cha focused on Big String, who was fleeing in a boat with three of his bodyguards.[3]
            Cha dove underwater and raced towards the craft, launching upward through it, destroying its engine and overturning it; quickly ending String's escape. Cha confronted String, who pleaded to know why Cha had destroyed the "empire" he had spent twenty cycles creating. After providing a name, Cha told the criminal that it was a contracted job. Cha then engaged the guards in hand-to-hand combat, quickly defeating them. Cha convinced String to drop his blaster, allowing Cha to hoist him up by his belt and took to the air using rocket boots to deliver the bounty.[3]
            However, once at cloud-level, Cha received a holographic comlink call from Emperor Palpatine. Cha apologized to String and dropped him; not wanting to ignore the call from this most important client. Palpatine appeared from the holoprojector and informed Cha that his yacht, the Imperialis, had been stolen from an Imperial shipyard in the Castell system, and he wanted Cha to recover it, because Palpatine had little faith in the military forces he had assigned to the task, stating that he needed a needle, and that Cha was the sharpest needle he had. The Emperor gave Cha a unique starship to aid in recovering the Imperialis, and told the bounty hunter that success would mean great reward—but if the yacht could not be recovered, Cha needed to destroy it, in order for the "personal items" it contained to not fall into the hands of others.[3]
            Cha immediately traveled to Imperial Facility 729-D, a classified Imperial space station that housed the vessel Palpatine promised Cha use of during the mission. She examined the exterior of the ship, noting it appeared unique in design. O-66, a droid sent by Palpatine to assist Cha, appeared and explained that the ship, the Scimitar, had been in use for an extended period of time by "special" owners. O-66 informed Cha that the technical readouts for the Scimitar were available, Cha, however, ordered O-66 to paraphrase the instructions. Once O-66 had done so, Cha removed O-66's head for protection; O-66 could no longer hold a weapon to attack Cha if that was the droid's programming. Cha then piloted the Star Courier into space, where O-66 explained that the Scimitar was configured to track the Imperialis's hyperdrive signature through space; a feat that Cha had believed impossible. However, the Imperialis's signature was very similar to that of a neutron star—which if the Scimitar tracked instead, would kill Cha when it emerged from hyperspace. Cha was unworried and entered hyperspace.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chanath_Cha</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemChanathCha</string></dict>
        <key>Mirax Terrik Horn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.107.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mirax Terrik Horn was the daughter of the smuggler Booster Terrik, wife of the Jedi Corran Horn, and mother of Valin and Jysella Horn.
            As their families were close, young Mirax often stayed with the Antilles family. She developed a friendship with their son Wedge, who nicknamed her "Myra" and whom she nicknamed "Veggies". When her father was finally apprehended by CorSec and sentenced to five years of hard labor on Kessel, the still underage Mirax took control of his smuggling operation. Under her guidance, the organization maintained its profitability despite turning almost completely legitimate. Wedge occasionally performed maintenance on her ship before he defected full time to the Rebellion.
            Several years later, Mirax turned to smuggling herself, operating her father's ship, Pulsar Skate. Mirax encountered Rogue Squadron a number of times, including on Mrlsst, where she aided the Rogues in bargaining for the Phantom Project. When the negotiations went sour, she escaped along with some of the other Rogues on Wes Janson's repulsorlift hoversled. Eventually, she and some of the others made their way to a base in the asteroid where the project was being held, only to discover it was a fake. The asteroid exploded, but Mirax and the Rogues escaped in the Skate.[5] She would later help Wedge again in his attempt to extract Sate Pestage from Ciutric IV, bringing the Skate and a load of R2 units in the Skate and serving as a decoy to allow the New Republic strike team to escape from the planet.[6]
            In 7 ABY, she came under attack by the Imperial ship, Black Asp, but was rescued by Rogue Squadron. In addition to her friend Wedge Antilles, the squadron also included Corran Horn—whose father Hal Horn had been responsible for arresting Mirax's father Booster Terrik. Needless to say, Mirax didn't enjoy being in debt to him, but her friendship with Wedge convinced her to aid the New Republic.
            Mirax's smuggling was essential in supplying bacta to the newly-liberated Coruscant, which was suffering from the Krytos virus. In this time, she was partnered with Horn, whom she eventually forgave and befriended. By the time of the Bacta War they had fallen in love, and just before the final battle of that conflict, she agreed when he asked to marry her. Shortly after the battle, they were married onboard the captured Super Star Destroyer Lusankya by Wedge Antilles in his authority as acting ship's captain. Shortly thereafter, a larger and more official ceremony was held on Coruscant.
            Following their wedding, Mirax began a shipping business, although she returned to smuggling during the Thrawn campaign to supply resistance cells and smuggle refugees on planets conquered by Grand Admiral Thrawn.
            Two years after Thrawn's death, she attempted to apprehend the rogue Moff Leonia Tavira, but was instead captured by her Invid pirates. She was imprisoned on the planet Suarbi, until her husband and Luke Skywalker could free her. In 13 ABY, she gave birth to a son, Valin, and later had a daughter, Jysella. By 19 ABY, she attended the wedding of Skywalker and Mara Jade; subsequently Mara and Mirax, both ex-smugglers, became good friends, and when Luke's duties kept him at the Jedi Praxeum for long periods, Mara crewed aboard the Pulsar Skate with her. On one trip, at some point prior to 25 ABY, they were charged with causing criminal damage after a run-in with rivals or enemies, though the exact circumstances are unknown, and both women were ultimately exonerated.
            Being married to a Jedi Knight, Mirax soon took an interest in the New Jedi Order. She often monitored requests for courier runs, and gave special priority to Jedi requests. This led her to transport Luke and Mara Skywalker, Anakin Solo, and Chalco to Vortex, in pursuit of the rogue Twi'lek Jedi Daeshara'cor. Later, during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Mirax was with Corran several times at Eclipse—including during the Yuuzhan Vong assault on the Eclipse Station Jedi base. Later the two were attacked by voxyn while hiding on Corellia.
            In 40 ABY, due to her husband's status as a Jedi, she was placed under house arrest by Thrackan Sal-Solo's government. Following the death of Sal-Solo, the house arrest was lifted. Mirax and Corran later aided the Solos and Wedge on Corellia after the three severed their ties with the Five Worlds. They took refuge on the Errant Venture, where Mirax finally acceded to years of her father's demands to learn the operations of the mobile smuggler's den - chiefly as she had very little else to do.
            In 43.5 ABY, two years after the end of the Second Galactic Civil War, Mirax and her family suffered a very personal tragedy. With the beginning of the Open Alliance Talks, Mirax's entire family was on Coruscant, a rare occasion, and she had arranged for the family to stay together during the conference. While making breakfast one morning, Mirax was horrified when she was attacked by her son Valin. Mirax escaped injury due to the arrival of Corran but was forced to shoot her deranged son with a stun bolt to prevent him from killing what he perceived as a false Corran. She later learned that Valin was afflicted with a mysterious ailment that caused him to see everyone around him as impostors, even his parents. Mirax could do nothing as Valin eventually became a fugitive and was later captured and imprisoned in carbonite. She would later assist members of Darkmeld during the Raid on the Armand Isard Correctional Facility.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mirax_Terrik_Horn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMiraxTerrikHorn</string></dict>

A rival of Darth Mekhis, Hadra presided over the Empire's capital world of Dromund Kaas in addition to the Sphere of Technology—one of the twelve Spheres of Influence that were each controlled by a member of the Council. Hadra gained her seat on the Dark Council after a Republic Strategic Information Service operation resulted in Mekhis's disappearance. When her forces discovered an ancient Sith shrine near Kaas City, she attempted to claim it as her territory, but Darth Arctis—the leader of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge—protested her claim and became embroiled in a conflict with Hadra. She used a purple double-bladed lightsaber in combat.
            During 3641 BBY, Hadra and fellow Dark Councilor Darth Acharon traveled to the contested planet of Corellia to reinforce Darth Decimus, head of the Sphere of Military Strategy, in the war effort there. Darth Hadra along with Acharon and Decimus were called via holo to an emergency Dark Council meeting by Darth Baras, who attempted to claim the position of Emperor's Voice and was then struck down by the Emperor's Wrath, then Hadra and the rest of the Dark Council pledged their loyalty to their Emperor's Wrath. During the Republic push on the Legislature Building, Hadra locked herself in the safe room with the Corellian Council. When a Republic Hero arrived to oppose her, she stated that the Council joined the Empire willingly and her death would not change that. After an intense fight, Hadra was defeated and killed.
            Darth Hadra was capable of Force lightning. Hadra used a purple double-bladed Sith lightsaber. She was also a superior combatant to Darth Mekhis.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Hadra</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDarthHadra</string></dict>

Her House was an ally of House Thul, and thus of the reconstituted Sith Empire.
            During the Cold War, Imperial Intelligence dispatched their rising-star agent, code-name Cipher Nine, to search for information regarding a financial backer of the terrorist leader known as "The Eagle", responsible for the assassination of Darth Jadus, a member of the Dark Council. The Baroness initially responded with hostility, barring the Agent from entering the estate. In time, however, the Cipher Agent was able to secure an audience with the Baron and Baroness, explaining the mission: to locate the Eagle's financial backer on Alderaan, former nobleman-turned-mediator Denri Ayl. After defeating Ayl in the estate of House Rist, Cipher Nine discovered that Ayl had been supported by Baroness Chay. In response, the Baroness locked down the Cortess estate, ordering the House guard to treat the Agent as a hostile.
            With the aid of Joiner emissary Vector Hyllus, Cipher Nine destroyed House Cortess' defenses and entered the throne room, confronting Chay with the evidence of her treachery. The Baron, outraged, ordered his guard captain Perovius to kill the Baroness.

        <key>Jysella Horn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.111.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jysella Horn, nicknamed Sella, was a female Human Jedi Knight in the New Jedi Order. As of 43.5 ABY, Jysella carried a blue-bladed lightsaber. She was the daughter of Corellian parents, Corran Horn and Mirax Terrik Horn, and the younger sister of Valin Horn. In 43.5 ABY, she was one of the first Jedi to succumb to a mysterious illness.
            Jysella was born around 16 ABY.[1] By 25 ABY, she was a student at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, and she had spent more of her young life being trained there than she had living with her parents.[source?]
            After the Yuuzhan Vong attack on Yavin, Jysella spent a number of months aboard her grandfather Booster Terrik's ship Errant Venture with her family, before being moved to the Shelter base in the Maw with the other Jedi children. At the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War, she was still grouped among the younglings, but she was one of the many Jedi who gathered in the Jedi conclave on Zonama Sekot.[source?]
            By 40 ABY, Jysella was a Jedi Knight on active duty. As tensions between Corellia and the Galactic Alliance developed into an interstellar crisis, Luke Skywalker tactfully assigned her to a mission far away from her homeworld, to avoid a conflict of loyalties when the Jedi were called on to serve as Alliance commandos and starfighter pilots in Operation Roundabout and subsequent missions.[3]
            In 43.5 ABY, Jysella was the third known Jedi to become ill with the mysterious Force psychosis that afflicted both her older brother Valin and Jedi Knight Seff Hellin. During an attempt to seek information on the illness with Master Cilghal, Jysella snapped and immediately saw the Master as an impostor. Unlike her brother, who experienced intense anger, she was motivated by fear. Jysella attempted to escape from the temple and then when evaluating the situation unintentionally flow walked into the future and saw her path of escape. This knowledge allowed her to know exactly where the secret security droids were hidden at the Temple's entrance, and she quickly disabled them.[1]
            Jysella continued to flee the Temple, Force hurling pedestrians out of the way and screaming in terror that those whom she knew best were not themselves. Two of her best friends, Bazel Warv and Yaqeel Saav'etu, who had also been Valin's best friends, were on the scene and quickly attempted to stop her once they realized she was afflicted. The two Jedi were unsuccessful and Jysella was apprehended by GA security. The entire scene was recorded by journalist Javis Tyrr. Chief of Staff Natasi Daala arrived soon after and addressed the crowd; explaining that Jysella was now under GA jurisdiction and would be frozen in carbonite alongside her older brother.[source?]
            When a group of Jedi executed a court-approved document to visit the carbonite-frozen Horn children, the group, along with the press, discovered the two Jedi displayed over an aquarium in the main office lobby of the Galactic Justice Center. While the Horns were still frozen, Daala continued to clamp down on the Jedi. Bazeel and Yaqeel became psychotic and were apprehended by the Solos and Jagged Fel. But before GAS could apprehend them, Jagged Fell and the Solos managed to whisk them away. Later three more sheltered knights Sothias Saar, Kunar Baan, and Turi Altamik became sick. And when Acting Grand master refused to hand over Sothias and Turi (Kunar was apprehended in the temple so Daala didn't know about him.) into Alliance custody, Daala sent a battalion of Mandalorian soldiers and vehicles to lock down the temple. A day later when the psychotic knights had recovered from the illness, thanks to indirect efforts of Luke Skywalker, Ben Skywalker, and a fleet of Sith, Daala publicly agreed to call off the siege, but refused to release Valin and Jysella until she was satisfied that the Jedi would hide nothing from her.
            Acting Grand master Kenth Hamner tried to keep the Jedi order from taking any action to release the kids because it would void his secret unsanctioned deal with Admiral Nek Bwua'tu. The entire Council was upset at Kenth, especially Corran Horn, the father of Valin and Jysella, at the Grand Master allowing his children to remain at Daala's mercy, accusing him of stalling. Later Daala hired a company of Mandalorians to 'put down' a crowd of pacifist Octusi servants on Blaudu Sextus, resulting in a merciless slaughter.
            After waiting impatiently for the chance to launch their StealthXs due to Grand Master Kenth Hamner attempting to buy time for Admiral Bwua'tu to wake up, they told him that they must launch now, before it was too late, he still rebuked them. Finally Han Solo forced him to reveal his deal with Bwaatu and the entire Council stripped him of his title and confined him to his quarters. Luke had Ben secretly ask the Temple for backup on the Moon of Pydyr to deal with Abeloth and the Lost Tribe. To that end the Jedi came up with a plan to both reinforce the Skywalkers, and rescue Jysella and Valin.
            Their grandfather Booster Terrick brought the Errant Venture into Coruscant's orbit to host a sabacc tournament,with dozens of political and social elites, including Chief of Staff Wynn Dorvan joining the fifty-million credit prize sabacc tournament, Booster began opening fire on the Coruscant's climate control system and diverted the Galactic Alliance Fleet's attention long enough to give the Jedi a chance to launch their StealthX strike team without a shot being fired. In the chaos Jaina, Leia, and Han Solo led another strike team consisting of Zekk, Terran Zel, and many of the recently recovered knights to break into the GA detention center and recover Horn siblings' carbonite pods. With the Jedi StealthX fleet gone, the Horns lost, and Imperial head of state Head of State Fel withdrawing from negotiations with the Galactic Alliance, GA Chief of State Daala had lost all of her leverage against the Jedi order and was publicly humiliated. Soon Corran and Mirax were present when Cilghal unfroze the kids from carbonite.[source?]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jysella_Horn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJysellaHorn</string></dict>

        <key>Amilyn Holdo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.114.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Amilyn Holdo was a human female from the planet Gatalenta. In her youth, Holdo served in the Apprentice Legislature of the Imperial Senate, where she became acquainted with Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. During her time in the Apprentice Legislature, Holdo became friends with Organa, who confided with her about involvement with the rebellion against the Galactic Empire.
            By the year 34 ABY, Holdo became a Vice Admiral in Organa's Resistance during its war with the First Order, and was given command of the cruiser Ninka. Taking overall command of the Resistance after the deaths of most of the commanders and Organa's incapacitation, Holdo devised a plan to save the remaining personnel by evacuating them on transports while she stayed behind on the command ship to draw attention away from them.
            When the transports came under fire, Holdo piloted the heavy cruiser Raddus into position and jumped to lightspeed through Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship, the Mega-class Star Destroyer Supremacy. Her sacrifice allowed the remaining transports to reach the planet Crait, where they subsequently escaped to fight another day.
            A human female, Amilyn Holdo was born on the planet Gatalenta during the early Imperial Era. In the year 3 BBY, Holdo joined the Apprentice Legislature, an Imperial organization on Coruscant for youth in politics. While in the Apprentice Legislature, Holdo met Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, daughter of Senator Bail Organa. Holdo and Princess Organa spent much time together during senatorial sessions and routine pathfinding training on various worlds such as Alderaan, Eriadu, and Felucia. While pathfinding on the planet Pamarthe, Holdo discovered Organa's involvement with the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Soon after, Holdo helped Organa find passage to the Paucris system in order to warn the fleet of an impending Imperial attack.[1]
            In 2 BBY, the rebellion became the Alliance to Restore the Republic,[6] Holdo joined the Rebellion at the start of the Galactic Civil War,[5] in which the Empire was toppled and replaced with a New Republic.[7] However, an Imperial remnant reorganized into the First Order,[8] so in 28 ABY,[9] Organa created the Resistance to oppose them.[8] By 34 ABY,[2] during the conflict between the two groups, Holdo joined the Resistance military and served as a Vice Admiral and commanding officer of the cruiser Ninka.[3]
            After the attack on Starkiller Base, she was posted on the Resistance ship Ninka. On D'Qar just before the First Order's arrival, she briefed the Resistance pilots from Cobalt and Crimson Squadron about the events of the annihilation of the Hosnian system as well as the subsequent destruction of Starkiller Base. She offered ammunition from her ship to help arm their squadrons. Having heard of Rose Tico's previous accomplishments with Cobalt Squadron, Holdo asked her to take a position on the Ninka as part of the maintenance team.[10]
            During an attack on the Raddus, the ship's commander Leia Organa was ejected from the bridge and left unconscious, the attack also killing the entire High Command stationed on the bridge. Following the chain of command, Commander Larma D'Acy delegated overall command of the Resistance to Holdo, who had transferred from her ship to the Raddus to take full command. After thanking D'Acy, Holdo addressed the situation by explaining that the 400 personnel on three ships comprised the very last of the Resistance, but they would survive. Holdo had the remaining ships continue full ahead to keep out of the First Order's range, but their fuel reserves dwindled and they lost their medical frigate Anodyne when it ran dry. Holdo received a communication from the Anodnye's captain informing her that the rest of its crew had escaped and were heading her way, but the transmission was lost as the First Order destroyed the defenseless frigate. Shortly after, Holdo's own ship, the Ninka, was destroyed as well.[3]
            Poe Dameron and Holdo were not on good terms, immediately butting heads over the issue of Dameron's recent demotion and apparent lack of any decisive action. Deeming him an impulsive and reckless "fly-boy," Holdo recognized that as a liability rather than an asset for the current situation and instead ordered him to stick to his post and follow her orders. Unfortunately, Holdo's lack of transparency with Dameron would have serious repercussions.
            When Tico and former First Order Stormtrooper Finn devised a plan to infiltrate the First Order's flagship, the Supremacy, Dameron went behind Holdo's back and sanctioned their mission, which ultimately failed and resulted in the First Order eventually learning of Holdo's plans. When Holdo ordered the crew of the Raddus to evacuate to the planet Crait via rescue transports, Dameron and some crew members held the Admiral and several senior officers at gunpoint and took control of the ship. Holdo escaped the mutiny, however, by kicking a steam pipe and stunning her antagonists while Organa, who had recovered, incapacitated Dameron and sent him to Crait with the rest of the crew. Although labeling Dameron a troublemaker, Holdo and Organa agreed that they liked him. Holdo refused to board a transport herself, however, and told Organa that someone had to stay on the Raddus to keep it going and said she would be honored to do it. Though Organa was extremely reluctant to take any more losses that day, especially another good friend, Holdo consoled her and bid her friend goodbye with the phrase, "May the Force be with you."[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Amilyn_Holdo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAmilynHoldo</string></dict>

        <key>Khaleen Hentz</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.117.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Khaleen Hentz was a Human female who was once a Separatist agent sent by Count Dooku to spy on Quinlan Vos as a mole in his spy network until she later turned to the Galactic Republic and became the wife of Vos and the mother of his child.
            Hentz used to work as a professional thief, who was good at her work, and spent time in prison at least once.
            During the Separatist Crisis, Dooku had her infiltrate the undercover spy ring Vos was establishing for Tholme in the guise of a prostitute. To gain Quinlan's confidence, she was to pretend to love him, but as she fell in love with him legitimately, she stopped working for Dooku and became Quinlan's agent.
            On the Wheel, shortly after the Battle of Geonosis, under direction of another of Dooku's agents, Tookarti, Hentz stole a data chip from the crime lord Zenex, containing the Confederacy of Independent Systems plans to attack Kamino. Zenex ordered the mercenary Grakko to find and kill her, but Grakko didn't succeed—Hentz killed him instead, by setting off one of his own thermal detonators. However, she soon ended up in a garbage pit—within it was a dianoga. She was barely saved by Vos and his former apprentice, Aayla Secura, posing as a mechanic named Jayzaa. She overheard their conversation about the disc and guessed that they were Jedi. In order to ensure that the Galactic Republic would be able to successfully defend Kamino, she was to give the data chip back to Zenex, under the watchful eye of Jedi Knights Vos and Aayla Secura. The plan appeared to be going well: Zenex promised he wouldn't kill her if she handed over the disc. Instead, he used his Falleen pheromones to make her point a blaster at her own head and kill herself. Vos intervened and saved Hentz's life, whereas Secura killed Zenex by impaling him on her lightsaber.
            Hentz and Vos eventually fell in love, despite the protestations of Vos' Padawan Aayla and the disapproval of Vos' former master Tholme. During Vos' arrest and defection in the aftermath of the Battle of Brentaal IV, Hentz took a speeder and helped him escape, knowing full well that she would do jail time again. Weeks later, Vos managed to infiltrate Dooku's inner circle, and Tholme released Hentz so she could serve as a go-between for Vos and himself.
            While Vos continued his role as a double agent, Hentz was with him. She traveled with him to Coruscant during his quest to find and destroy the person he thought was the second Sith. After Vos killed Senator Viento under the false impression that he was the second Sith, Hentz was to pick him up after he fled the building, but was stopped by Dooku's Dark Acolyte Tol Skorr.
            Hentz was soon forced to come with Vos to Viento's tomb, where he read his carbonite corpse. As part of Vos' further quest, Dexter Jettster put out the word that Hentz wanted to hire the Anzati bounty hunter Saljé Tasha for a job. When Vos met Tasha, he confronted the bounty hunter and managed to draw the memories he sought from her mind. When her Anzati proboscises uncurled as she tried to feed upon his mind, Hentz interfered and hit her hard with a metal pole. Deciding that Tasha served her purpose, she decided to kill the Anzat. Tasha, angry that she had barely tasted the richness of Quinlan's mind, vowed vengeance on her.
            Hentz traveled to Saleucami to set up Vos' meeting with Sora Bulq, whom he believed to be the second Sith. In a city cantina, she met Skorr and a few Anzati who were warned about her. Skorr told her to relay to Vos that he is allowed inside the base. He then called her a little bug and intimidated her by Force choking her. After having his little fun, Skorr told Hentz that Vos didn't love her—he used her. While gasping for breath, Hentz murmured behind his back that Vos loved her.
            Hentz then came back to the Republic base, trying to make "a toy" work until Quinlan came in and told her that it was a holocron. She told him the plan and then spent a night with him.
            Hentz was then captured by Skorr, who brought her to show Vos the truth of her mission. Hentz confessed that she was Dooku's double agent and pretended to love him but then fell in love with him for real. She pleaded with her love to look at her to see the truth. Despite urgings from Dooku and Bulq to kill her in order to complete his transition to the dark side, Vos cupped Hentz's face in his hands, kissed her and then ignited his lightsaber to free her of her cuffs. But with Dark Jedi and Anzati surrounding them, escape seemed impossible, until Tholme showed up. While the Jedi battled against their dark counterparts, Hentz killed every Anzati that tried to take her "soup". But when Quinlan fought against Sora Bulq and was getting closer to the dark side, Secura and Tholme joined to save him; Hentz thought that he was dying. When Vos killed Bulq, they managed to escape the base when the Republic began bombardment. Soon, Vos learned another secret Hentz was hiding—she was pregnant with his child. He decided that when the war was over, he would leave the Jedi Order to be with her. He told her to take the Skorp-Ion to a safe place in the galaxy.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Khaleen_Hentz</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKhaleenHentz</string></dict>

            The eccentric, Force-sensitive, old woman Halla lived on Mimban where she was popular with the mining community. The Temple of Pomojema was known to hold the legendary Kaiburr crystal, which she much sought; she spent seven years searching, often asking natives in return for alcoholic beverages.
            Claiming to be a master of the Force, she struck a deal with Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa for them to help her find the crystal; if they did, Halla would help them get off the planet Mimban on which they were stranded. She soon had to rescue Luke and Leia from a prison cell by using the Force to guide a food tray over to open the cell, and she later joined Luke and Leia to speed through the swampy lands of Mimban in a stolen craft, only to be encountered by a fearsome wandrella.
            Halla escaped, and found Luke and Leia in a Thrella well. She instructed them to make their way through a tunnel in the well to meet up with her on the other side. Halla made her way to the opposite end of the tunnel, went down in it, but was then captured by the Coway. She was tied up and forced to watch Luke battle a Coway. When Luke won, Halla was released.
            She feasted with the Coway, but soon Luke sensed the Dark Lord's approach. The Coway and the Imperials fought a fierce underground battle until the Coway won, and Halla traveled with Luke and Leia to find the crystal at the temple. There she took it and gave it to Luke, who, after defeating Darth Vader and healing Leia's wounds, gave it back to her. She then left Mimban with Luke and Leia to join the Rebel Alliance, though not before admitting to Luke that rather than being a master of the Force, she was really a faker and a charlatan, capable of doing "parlor tricks" but little more.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Halla</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemHalla</string></dict>

            Jabitha was the granddaughter of the planet's first Magister, Leor Hal. She survived the attack by the Far Outsiders—the name the Sekotans gave the Yuuzhan Vong—but her father was killed. However, Sekot made a mental image of her father, so that everyone believed that he was still alive.
            In 29 BBY, she briefly befriended Anakin Skywalker, who named his ship after her. After the Second Battle of Zonama Sekot, Jabitha was on the planet when it disappeared into hyperspace towards the Unknown Regions.
            Some time later she herself became Magister. When Luke Skywalker and his team arrived on Zonama Sekot seeking help in defeating the Yuuzhan Vong, Jabitha was hesitant to act, but welcomed them out of memory of Anakin. Finally convinced that their intentions were good, she was instrumental in helping Sekot decide to join the New Jedi Order in attempting to peacefully resolve the Yuuzhan Vong War.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jabitha_Hal</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJabithaHal</string></dict>
        <key>Anora Fair</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.124.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Anora Fair was a human female who worked as a journalist shortly after the rise of the Galactic Empire. Anora was a close friend of the Zygerrian film maker Hask Taff. In 18 BBY, the two helped expose the Antar Atrocity, a violent Imperial purge that indiscriminately slaughtered numerous civilians on Antar 4 including Republic loyalists. Their relentless coverage and criticism of the Empire made them targets of the Imperial Security Bureau.
            The former Republic Intelligence officer Berch Teller spirited Anora and Hask into hiding. The two subsequently joined Teller's rebel cell, which sought vengeance against Moff Wilhuff Tarkin for his role in engineering the Antar Atrocity. After stealing Tarkin's personal starship Carrion Spike, the insurgents launched a brief insurgency against the Empire. Following the Battle near the Gulf of Tatooine, Anora and most of Teller's followers were captured, interrogated, and executed by the Empire.
            Anora Fair was a Core Worlds–based journalist who lived during the Clone Wars and the Imperial Era. A vocal critic of the Galactic Empire, Fair was known for her probing interviews with Imperial officials and her editorials criticizing Imperial policies and the Emperor Palpatine. During the Antar Atrocity of 18 BBY, Fair reported extensively on Imperial atrocities. Her reports were supplemented by holographic reenactments of arrests and executions, produced and directed by her Zygerrian colleague Hask Taff. Their primary source was Berch Teller, a disaffected Republic Intelligence officer who was outraged by the indiscriminate slaughter of Gotal and Koorivar loyalists he had trained during the Antar Atrocity.[1]
            Due to their coverage of the Antar Atrocity, the Imperial Security Bureau targeted Anora and Hask for assassination. However, the two managed to escape into hiding with the help of Teller, who formed a rebel cell dedicated to resisting the Empire. Teller's rebel cell consisted of many survivors and witnesses of the Antar Atrocity who bore a special hatred for Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the architect of the Antar Atrocity. Teller's cell was secretly aided by the Imperial Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit, a rival of Tarkin and Director of the Naval Intelligence Agency. Rancit used his high-level intelligence and underworld connections to supply the dissidents with Clone Wars-era weapons, starships, communications equipment, and intelligence.[1]
            In 14 BBY, following the failed attack on Sentinel Base, Anora along with Hask, Teller, the Gotal pilot Salikk, the Koorivar operations specialist Cala, and the Mon Calamari engineer Dr. Artoz took part in a mission to steal Moff Tarkin's stealth corvette Carrion Spike. Teller intended to use Tarkin's starship to stage attacks on Imperial targets across the galaxy. To inspire rebellion, Anora and Task were tasked with producing holovids of the attacks that would be broadcast on HoloNet, mimicking the Separatist Shadowfeed broadcasts of the Clone Wars.[1]
            The insurgents were aided by Rancit, who planted a communications cache on the planet Murkhana. While Tarkin and Darth Vader visited the planet to investigate, the insurgents stormed and stole the Carrion Spike. Despite luring Sergeant Crest and most of the guards away, the insurgents still had to fight and kill the ship's captain, comms officer, and two stormtroopers. During the skirmish, Anora collided with Hask, causing her friend to shoot her blaster, damaging the airlock.[1]
            After stealing the Carrion Spike, the insurgents fled into space. While traveling through the Murkhana system, Anora asked Artoz which of the controls emptied the toilets. She and Hask then argued over who was to blame for the damaged airlock until Teller intervened. When Anora asked if all of the Emperor's Moffs had advanced starships, Teller responded that Tarkin was the only known Moff to be afforded such a privilege. Hask also corroborated Teller's account that Tarkin had been designing ships for his homeworld of Eriadu's Outland Regions Security Force when he was nineteen years old [1]
            Anora also asked Teller why Tarkin named his ship the Carrion Spike but the former intelligence officer admitted his ignorance on the matter. When Hask referred to Darth Vader by his adoptive name, Anora dismissed Vader as a machine and a terrorist. She also told Teller that he took a real risk by having Vader and Tarkin walk right into a "sliding door ambush." Teller said they had to make the scenario ring true and that the Imperials getting themselves blown up would not have affected their plans in any way.[1]
            The rebels were soon pursued by the Parsec Predator, the personal starship of the Sugi crime lord Faazah. Hask and Anora quickly deduced that they were being pursued by Tarkin and Lord Vader, who had commandeered the Parsec Predator. Under Teller's direction, the rebels took a hyperspace jump to the Fial system. However, Vader was able to track them down using meditation sphere aboard the Carrion Spike. The rebels then made a second jump to the Galidraan system.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anora_Fair</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAnoraFair</string></dict>

        <key>Arliz Hadrassian</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.126.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Arliz Hadrassian was a female human who served in the Galactic Empire prior to its defeat at the Battle of Jakku. Initially a TIE fighter pilot flying for the Imperial Starfleet, she later became an officer of the Imperial Security Bureau and helped chase down spicerunners around Kessel and Kerev Doi. Her elder brother also served the Empire as a member of Emperor Palpatine's Royal Guard.
            Following the Empire's defeat at Jakku and the establishment of the New Republic, Hadrassian became a small-time businesswoman and the leader of the Amaxine warriors. Twenty-four years after the Battle of Endor, she assisted Carise Sindian in her conspiracy to help the First Order by orchestrating the Napkin Bombing of the Galactic Senate and assassinating Senator Tai-Lin Garr, quickly committing suicide afterwards.
            During the Age of the Empire, Arliz Hadrassian along with several members of her family and friends served in the Imperial Navy. She served as a TIE fighter pilot before becoming an Imperial Security Bureau officer. Hadrassian spent a significant portion of her career chasing down spice smugglers around Kessel and Kerev Doi. She also had an elder brother who served in the Emperor's Royal Guard around the time of the Battle of Endor. This brother had fallen ill prior to the battle and was not on the second Death Star when it was destroyed. Following Emperor Palpatine's death, Hadrassian's brother continued serving the Empire and perished during the Battle of Jakku. Hadrassian later acquired her brother's Royal Guard helmet as a memento.[2]
            Following the Galactic Concordance, Hadrassian became a small-time businesswoman on the Outer Rim world of Daxam IV. She also became the leader of a paramilitary faction called the Amaxine warriors that had ties to an Imperial remnant called the First Order and the Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di's cartel. The Amaxines wore black jumpsuits, trained with Force pikes, and had several starfighter squadrons. About twenty four years after the Battle of Endor, the Amaxines numbered several thousand and were well-equipped enough to pose a threat to the New Republic, the successor government that had been created by the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[2]
            Under the leadership of Hadrassian, the Amaxines supplied both funds and pilots to Rinnrivin's cartel. While the Amaxines on the surface appeared to be the financiers and partners of Rinnrivin's operations, they were actually a front for the First Order; which used Rinnrivin's cartel's smuggling and gambling operations to generate funds to rebuild the old Imperial fleet. Rinnrivin channeled his revenue back to the First Order through the auspices of several shadow corporations and Centrist sources like Senator Lady Carise Sindian. While Hadrassian saw the Amaxines as the vanguard of the First Order, her collaborator Lady Carise viewed them as a distraction that would justify the First Order's attempts to "restore order" to the galaxy.[2]
            In 28 ABY,[1] Rinnrivin's criminal activities in the Gaulus sector began to take a toll on the economy of Ryloth. Following a petition to the New Republic Galactic Senate by Ryloth's Emissary Yendor, the Populist Senator Leia Organa and her Centrist colleague Ransolm Casterfo agreed to investigate Rinnrivin's cartel. Around the time of the investigation, Arliz visited the casino hub of Bastatha with a group of companions. She crossed paths with Leia's team and took the opportunity to observe the former rebel leader and New Republic senator. Despite her best attempts to stay unnoticed, Leia noticed her.[2]
            Later, Leia's pilots Greer Sonnel and Joph Seastriker visited Pamarthe and learned that Rinnrivin was hiring Amaxines pilots from Daxam IV. With the approval of Lady Carise, Hadrassian staged a "distraction" to delay the investigation. While Carise had envisioned a scandal or accident, the fanatical Hadrassian went further and used a Twi'lek individual to plant a bomb in the Senatorial conference building. However, Leia discovered a message warning of the bomb and managed to order an evacuation of the building, saving many lives. The so-called Napkin Bombing strained relations between Hadrassian and Lady Carise, who came to regard the former as a liability to the First Order.[2]
            Following the Napkin Bombing, Arliz Hadrassian, using the pseudonym Crimson Blade, arranged to sell the helmet of her Imperial Royal Guard brother to an offworld buyer. This buyer turned out to be Senator Casterfo, who used the transaction as an opportunity to visit and investigate Daxam IV. With the approval of Senator Organa, Casterfo traveled with Greer to rendezvous with Crimson Sword. Hadrassian arranged to meet her buyer at a run-down teahouse. Upon entering the teahouse, Casterfo immediately recognized Hadrassian as the woman that had been watching the senatorial delegation on Bastatha.[2]
            After exchanging greetings, Casterfo asked Hadrassian how she obtained the Imperial helmet. While the previous sellers he had encountered had usually obtained their Imperial artifacts as trophies of war, Hadrassian related the story of her brother's service as an Imperial Royal Guard. Assuming the Centrist senator to be an Imperial sympathizer, Hadrassian told Casterfo that he was the right customer she had been looking for. After Casterfo asked about her time in the Imperial Navy, Hadrassian spent the next two hours regaling the young senator with stories from her work as a TIE fighter pilot and later an ISB officer.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Arliz_Hadrassian</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemArlizHadrassian</string></dict>
        <key>Inyri Forge</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.127.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Inyri Forge was a Human female from Kessel. The younger sister of former Rogue Lujayne Forge, Inyri joined Rogue Squadron shortly after the conquest of Coruscant.
            Inyri was born on Kessel to Kassar and Myda Forge. Kassar was a teacher who volunteered to go to Kessel under a Galactic Republic program to educate inmates on how to re-enter society upon release. Her mother was one of the inmate students who fell in love with him and decided to stay with him on Kessel.
            Inyri had multiple brothers and sisters (including Lujayne), all of whom were still alive and living on Kessel in 6.5 ABY.
            While planning the Coruscant battle, officials decided to free some high profile prisoners in order to cause chaos in the heart of the Galactic Empire. One of those prisoners was Zekka Thyne, of the Black Sun organization. Along with Zekka came Inyri, his "glitterstim cutter" and lover. Inyri, being born on Kessel, and not sent there, was not a criminal, but she was insistent on staying with Zekka, even when the squadron offered to aid her.
            However, things changed as the undercover mission on Coruscant progressed. Inyri began to rethink her loyalty towards Zekka, especially after an incident when they came under fire, and he ran to save himself while Rogue member Gavin Darklighter came to her aid.
            Finally, things came to a head when Zekka attempted to kill Corran Horn, whom he blamed for putting him on Kessel in the first place. Inyri shot and killed Zekka before he could go through with it. Having proven herself, Inyri joined the Rogues for the Coruscant battle, and was inducted formally into the squadron in the celebration afterwards.
            Inyri had been a steady member of Rogue Squadron ever since. She was a member of Requiem Squadron where she was disguised as Inyon Fass. She had bright red hair and was the sister of Teekon Fass.
            Later she achieved the rank of Major during the Caamas Document Crisis, and continued to serve with the squadron well into the Yuuzhan Vong War, fighting in the Battle of Dantooine and the Battle of Kalarba.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Inyri_Forge</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemInyriForge</string></dict>

        <key>Lujayne Forge</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.129.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lujayne Forge was a Human female from Kessel who served as a pilot for Rogue Squadron for the New Republic Defense Force. She was killed in her sleep by Imperial stormtroopers during a surprise attack on Talasea, making her the first pilot casualty in the newly reformed elite squadron.
            Lujayne was born on Kessel to Kassar and Myda Forge. Kassar was a teacher who volunteered to go to Kessel under a Galactic Republic program to educate inmates on how to re-enter society upon release. Her mother was one of the inmate students who fell in love with him and decided to stay with him on Kessel.
            Lujayne had multiple brothers and sisters (including Inyri), all of whom were still alive and living on Kessel in 6.5 ABY. She always told her family that she wanted to become a hero so that she could prove that something good could come out of Kessel, a goal Commander Wedge Antilles and Corran Horn said she achieved during her time on Rogue Squadron.[1]
            She learned a number of trade skills from her father's lessons, including landspeeder repair. Her expertise in repairing and maintaining T-47 airspeeders proved particularly helpful during her time with Rogue Squadron.[2]
            Lujayne was self-conscious and fiercely defensive of others associating her and her family with the reputation of prisoners and smugglers normally associated with the prison world of Kessel. When Corran Horn, a fellow Rogue agent and former Corellian Security Force officer, specifically targeted her ship during a training simulation, she confronted Horn about whether it was due to her Kessel background.[2]
            Horn later cited this encounter as having a major impact on his thinking, helping him to avoid making prejudgments against people based on their backgrounds, particularly when he eventually met Inyri.[1]
            Lujayne was chosen by Wedge Antilles as one of the inaugural pilots when he reformed Rogue Squadron in 6.5 ABY. Her call sign was Rogue Eleven. She flew in the squadron's Three Flight, which was led by Lieutenant Corran Horn.
            Her roommate and wingmate was Andoorni Hui, which proved challenging for Lujayne at first as she had seldom interacted with Rodians in the past and did not understand Rodese.
            Although she was a talented enough pilot to make the squadron, her scores were among the lowest of her fellow pilots, and she herself admitted that she was not up to the same level as fellow pilots Corran Horn and Bror Jace. She was visibly relieved when Gavin Darklighter, who secured no kills during a dogfight against Imperial TIEs at Hensara, was jokingly named "worst pilot in the squadron" instead of herself.
            Wedge told superiors that Lujayne was not the squadron's greatest pilot, but was a "fighter" and a wise pilot who was "not one to take chances."[2]
            Corran considered Lujayne the heart of the unit, always looking after the physical and emotional well being of her fellow Rogues. Gavin, the youngest pilot on the inaugural squadron, became particularly attached to Lujayne, and she took him under her wing and helped him improve his astronavigation skills.
            She also helped Corran Horn repair the engine of his X-wing starfighter and encouraged Corran, who was initially standoffish with his fellow pilots and reluctant to work with teammates, to interact with and integrate himself among the other Rogue Squadron members.
            Lujayne Forge was killed in her sleep during a covert assault by a stormtrooper platoon against a Rogue Squadron training base on Talasea. Although six sentries were killed and Corran Horn, Gavin Darklighter and Andoorni Hui were seriously injured during the surprise attack, Forge was the only Rogue Squadron pilot to be killed.
            Her death took a particularly heavy toll on Rogue Squadron, both because of the way she watched out for her pilots, and due to the ignominious fashion she was killed, murdered in cold blood rather than falling in combat. As Wedge predicted, her death was particularly difficult for Gavin Darklighter, because of the fact that Forge was teaching Darklighter astronavigation skills, thus they had a closer connection as a teacher and student.
            A large memorial held for Lujayne and the six fallen sentries was attended by Wedge, Rogue Squadron, Admiral Ackbar, General Horton Salm and his Defender Wing, and the crew and medical personnel of the Nebulon-B frigate Reprieve. Andoorni Hui, despite extensive injuries, was allowed to be released from her bacta tank and attend the memorial on a hover chair.
            Lujayne's sister, Inyri Forge, later joined Rogue Squadron to honor Lujayne after proving herself in the conquest of Coruscant.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lujayne_Forge</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLujayneForge</string></dict>
        <key>Forn Dodonna</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.130.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Forn Dodonna was an admiral in the Republic Navy during the Jedi Civil War. She was one of the most senior of naval personnel during the war. Towards the end of the war, Dodonna was signaled by Carth Onasi, who informed her of the Star Forge, a massive factory-space station that was being used by the Sith. Dodonna led the assault on the Star Forge, with the help of Jedi Master Vandar Tokare. Helped by the battle meditation of Padawan Bastila Shan, Dodonna broke through the Sith blockade of the Star Forge and ordered her ships to destroy the space station's main stabilizer. She later awarded the crew of the Ebon Hawk, including Carth, for their help during the battle.
            As an admiral serving with the Republic Navy, Admiral Dodonna led Republic forces against the Sith Empire during the Jedi Civil War from her flagship. Towards the end of the war, Admiral Dodonna was contacted by another naval officer, Carth Onasi, informing her of the location of a massive orbital factory called the Star Forge, an ancient relic of the Infinite Empire. The Star Forge was being used to churn out all the starships and war droids that powered the Sith fleet. Dodonna realized that this was the opportunity she desperately needed to put an end to the war. Gathering a fleet together, Admiral Dodonna set out for the Star Forge system. En route, Admiral Dodonna's fleet was reunited with many survivors of the Sith attack on the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. Led by Jedi Master Vandar Tokare, the group joined the fleet in its endeavor to destroy the Star Forge.[1]
            Upon arriving in the system, Admiral Dodonna's fleet was confronted with a sizeable defense fleet, which guarded the Star Forge itself. Dodonna was contacted by Carth Onasi once more, from the Ebon Hawk, whose crew deactivated a massive interdictor field being generated from the nearby planet Lehon, which would have otherwise destroyed the fleet. Admiral Dodonna was suffering heavy losses in space and suggested a retreat, but Carth insisted that the Republic probably wouldn't get another chance to strike at the Star Forge again. Dodonna conceded, and the Ebon Hawk's crew, at the advice of Master Vandar, resolved to lead a Jedi strike team onto the Star Forge, to find and kill Darth Malak, the leader of the Sith Empire.[1]
            Meanwhile, Dodonna was facing troubles of her own. Her entire fleet was faced with an impenetrable defensive line, preventing her from ordering a bombardment of the Star Forge. Carth attributed this to Bastila Shan, a fallen Jedi who was very adept at using battle meditation, a Force ability that allowed her to inspire allied troops and demoralize enemies, influencing an entire battle. Bastila's battle meditation was allowing the Sith to quickly counter every strategy Admiral Dodonna devised. Nevertheless, Admiral Dodonna pressed on.[1]
            Conditions soon changed after Bastila stopped using her battle meditation against the Republic fleet. Soon Dodonna's relentless press against the Sith ranks finally punctured a breach in the fleet's formation, splitting it into two groups. Admiral Dodonna quickly exploited this development, sending Red Squadron in with Green Squadron to widen the gap. She then ordered her capital ships to reinforce their positions.[1]
            Once in range, Admiral Dodonna's fleet commenced a concentrated assault on the Star Forge. Realizing that the Star Forge was too well reinforced to be destroyed directly by the fleet, Dodonna proposed a precision strike against the Star Forge's main orbital stabilizers. With these out of commission, the Star Forge would fall out of orbit and crash into the star below. This strategy was quickly implemented. After Admiral Dodonna's capital ships destroyed the stabilizers, she ordered the fleet to pull back away from the Star Forge, unwilling to risk any of her ships being destroyed during the Star Forge's descent.
            The Star Forge was finished, colliding with a solar flare which caused the Star Forge to incinerate from within. With the Star Forge destroyed and Malak dead, the Sith fleet was thrown into disarray, allowing the Republic to sweep through Sith space and recover their losses.[1]
            Returning to Lehon, the fleet celebrated their victory. Dodonna herself awarded the crew of the Ebon Hawk with the Cross of Glory, the Republic's most prestigious medal, on the steps of the Temple of the Ancients (the very place that the crew had disabled the disruptor field generator at), thus commemorating them for their invaluable support during the battle; even the crew's droids were given medals.[1]
            The remainder of the war was short; the Dark Jedi and Sith Lords on the Sith homeworld of Korriban quickly tore each other apart as each attempted to seize the title of Dark Lord of the Sith, a title held by Malak until his death, in a quick yet brutal civil war. This was the final blow to the Sith war effort, and the Jedi Civil War was over, though the Republic still had to recover from the destruction caused by the war. It can be speculated that Dodonna had Carth promoted to admiral during this time. Admiral Onasi would play an important role during the Dark Wars.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Forn_Dodonna</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemFornDodonna</string></dict>

            Flannis was a reporter for Colonial News Nets and traveled the Colonies, interviewing socialites, entertainment starlets and Imperial officers. She was known to produce some of the raciest stories for Colonial News Net. She was also an operative for the Alliance to Restore the Republic and would meet with Alliance agents to give them information about Rebel and Imperial activity in the Colonies. Despite working for the same organization she was not aware that Pertaal Shenvehr was also a Rebel operative.
            Flannis was an attractive Human female. She was shrewd and would have superficial conversations until she was certain that she was speaking to an agent of the Alliance. She had blond hair and dressed in expensive and fashionable clothing. Flannis secretly felt bitter towards the upper classes and worked against the Empire so that she could embarrass the Imperial elites.[1]
            Flannis was a skilled reporter and was well versed in handling a variety of social situations. She was also talented at undercover work and was able to sneak or bluff her way past security in order to get a scoop.[1]
            Flannis dressed in the latest and most expensive fashions. She wore a matching purse that concealed her reporter's datapad and a hold-out blaster she kept for protection. She had access to a 100,000 credit expense account from Colonial News.[1]

Along with their third crewmember, Jorj Car'das, Ferasi and Qennto were captured by Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo of Chiss Expansionary Defense Force when their hyperdrive malfunctioned during a smuggling run and they got lost in the Unknown Regions. During their captivity, which lasted for about three months, Ferasi and Car'das became friends with the commander, and Ferasi even saved Thrawn's life and had a crush on him. When the Chiss commander had studied his guest/prisoners enough, he allowed them to return to the Galactic Republic. Together with Qennto, Ferasi returned home on the Bargain Hunter while Car'das chose to accept an offer from Kinman Doriana—another Human who had been captured by Thrawn—to travel with him.
            Maris Ferasi was born on Corellia during the last decades of Galactic Republic. She was idealistic and believed the galactic government to be corrupted. To protest against the corruption, Ferasi hooked up with small-time smuggler Dubrak Qennto, a fellow Corellian. During her time on board Qennto's ship Bargain Hunter, Ferasi became accustomed to Qennto's temperament. Around 27 BBY Ferasi and Qennto were joined by third member of the crew, Jorj Car'das, who acted as a navigator.[1]
            When the group was transporting furs and hidden firegems to a Hutt gangster named Drixo, Progga—Drixo's rival—ambushed the Bargain Hunter. To escape the Hutt, the smuggling group made a risky jump into hyperspace, but their hyperdrive engine was damaged, stranding them far into the Unknown Regions of the galaxy. Progga had followed their jump and moved to attack them again, but instead both ships fell under attack from a local patrol. Bargain Hunter was captured in a shock net, which disabled the ship's electronic systems, while Progga's ship was destroyed. The leader of the patrol, Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force, captured Ferasi and her two companions, taking them and their ship to his base in Crustai system.[1]
            During her stay at the base, Ferasi became fascinated by the Chiss commander, which caused friction between her and Qennto. Together with Car'das, Ferasi attended language lessons with Thrawn—the two Humans teaching basic to the commander, who taught them Chiss language Cheunh and local trade-language Minnisiat, in return.[1]
            Maris asked to accompany Thrawn and Car'das when they went to investigate the Vagaari attack. Thrawn decided to accommodate her, and she and Car'das accompanied him on the Springhawk. Maris supported Thrawn even when he attempted capture of one of the Vagaari's Gravity-well projectors; a dangerous task. At one point during the battle Thrawn called for a close-up on the hull of one of the opposing warships and discovered that in each of the Zero-g plastic bubbles a slave was held. When Maris saw this she ordered Thrawn to find a way to destroy the warships without hurting the slaves, and then got mad at him when he said he could not. She soon forgot about it, however, when there appeared a sudden flash of light and subsequent disintegration of part of the canopy. When the dust cleared, she saw Thrawn laying on the floor, wounded, with a tear in his Vacc suit. She and Car'das rushed to him and tried to fix the rip with a Sealant patch, but it would not stick to the material. Maris went chest-to-chest with Thrawn to stop the air from leaking out of his suit with her hands clasped behind his back. She stayed this way until two Chiss came with a bigger patch and transported him to a medical room. One of them declared that she had saved Thrawn's life, and Thrawn himself expressed his gratitude to her when he was better.
            When they returned to base, they discovered Qennto's aggressive behavior had gotten him thrown in the brig. She convinced them to release him, but Qennto knew about Maris's 'esteem' for Thrawn and became so hostile that both he and Mavis were assigned escorts whenever they tried to leave their room.
            When Maris and Dubrak Qennto returned to Republic space after the destruction of Outbound Flight, they managed to pay back their debt to Drixo and continue their smuggling activities.
            Ferasi, along with Jorj Car'das, would later be known to the Chiss as The Visitors due to their teaching Basic to the Chiss while they were guests/captives of Commander Thrawn.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Maris_Ferasi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMarisFerasi</string></dict>
        <key>Arla Fett</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.134.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Arla Fett was the older sister of the bounty hunter and Mandalore Jango Fett, and the only daughter of their Journeyman Protector father. She was also the long-lost "aunt" of Boba Fett.
            Born on the planet of Concord Dawn, Arla spent her youth living on the Fett homestead with her parents and brother, Jango, who was to later be the father of Boba Fett. In 58 BBY, when she was 14,[1] the Mandalorian Civil War—fought between the True Mandalorians, under Jaster Mereel, and the splinter group known as the Death Watch, under Tor Vizsla—spread to Concord Dawn. When the Death Watch began hunting down members of the True Mandalorians that escaped from a lost battle, Arla's father offered Mereel and his men refuge on their farm. The Death Watch tracked them to the homestead and killed her father as her brother Jango was fleeing. When they turned their attention on Jango, Arla witnessed their mother shoot and kill one of the Death Watch members with a blaster rifle, only to be killed herself. While Jango fled and would be later be rescued by the Mandalorians, Vizsla ordered there be no witnesses and Arla was to be "taken care of".[2]
            Thus, Arla was believed to have been killed on Concord Dawn along with her parents. Seemingly unknown to anyone else, was the fact that she was spared by the members of the Death Watch, and was held hostage by them. They viewed her as a prize, and branded their logo onto her back. After a while as their prisoner, Arla joined the Death Watch cause as an assassin, and only left them when she got arrested for a shooting 10 years before the end of the Clone Wars. While in custody, Arla was deemed mentally unstable and was ordered to be held in the Valorum Center—a mental institution on Coruscant—for many years.[1][3]
            In 19 BBY, three years after Jango's death on at the Battle of Geonosis, the former Jedi-turned-Mandalorian, Bardan Jusik, visited the center looking for Separatist scientist, Dr. Ovolot Qail Uthan. At the time of his first visit, Jusik had walked passed Arla's cell, hearing words that resembled the Mandalorian language.[3] Later, during the Separatist invasion of Coruscant, Kal Skirata and Jusik returned to the center to free Uthan from her cell and upon doing so, Bardan again heard words that resembled Mando'a. The ex-Jedi acted on impulse and decided to free the prisoner, and when the group was picked up by Walon Vau afterward by a LAAT/i gunship, Jusik revealed her to be Arla Fett, Jango's lost and supposedly dead sister. Arla would go to Mandalore along with Jusik and the rest of the Skirata's rogue band when they fled Coruscant following the issue of Order 66, taking up residence in an old storage room at their bastion home of Kyrimorut.[3]
            At Kyrimorut, attempts were made to regulate Arla's medication from the regimen given at Valorum Center, but the dosages were insufficient and Arla attacked Jusik without any provocation. After hearing Arla's story and her insistence that she forget everything, Jusik offered to use the Force to wipe her memory of the traumatic events in exchange for intel on the Death Watch.[1]
            Arla Fett, after her capture by the Death Watch, was resentful of her captors, but grew to care for them. Instead of attempting to escape them, she joined their cause as an assassin. Through Death Watch intel, she found out that her younger brother Jango had survived, but made no move to reunite with him. During her arrest and incarceration at the Valorum Center, she was heavily sedated in an effort to prevent her from killing herself over the guilt she felt in her willing participation in a group that killed her family. After she was rescued by Bardan Jusik and brought back to Mandalore, her medication was changed, and while she was more lucid, her memories and the guilt came flooding back, and she ended up launching an unprovoked attack at Jusik while wandering around the compound. Later on, in a moment of clarity, Arla begged Jusik to kill her in an attempt to put her out of her misery, but he refused. Instead, the pair agreed to a compromise that involved Jusik erasing her memories in exchange for intel on the Death Watch.[1]
            Arla spoke the language of Concord Dawn, which is similar to Mando'a.[3] By her own admission, Arla was a "good shot" with a blaster, which helped her in her career as a Death Watch assassin.[1]
            Arla Fett first appeared in the comic Jango Fett: Open Seasons, but as an unnamed sister in a flashback. Most of her backstory, including her name, was fleshed out by Karen Traviss in the novels Order 66: A Republic Commando Novel and Imperial Commando: 501st.
            The character of Arla Fett suffered from an in-universe version of Stockholm syndrome, a mental illness where a captive comes to care for, and even love, her captors.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Arla_Fett</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemArlaFett</string></dict>
        <key>Sharina Fizark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.135.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sharina Nal Fizark was a Human female whom Revan met in Anchorhead on Tatooine in the year 3956 BBY. [1]
            Sharina was married to a man named Ward Fizark, who was a former miner and soldier. During a hunting trip, he acquired a bone plate of a wraid which was worth five hundred credits at the time. Ward told Sharina to keep it and went off for another hunt, but disappeared. Guards of a Sandcrawler found his body stripped of everything. She believed that the Gamorreans Gurke, Narkal and Ugzak were behind his death as they laughed at her about Ward's death.[1]
            Because her family had spent everything on Ward's gear, she was desperate for money after his death. She went to the streets trying to sell her wraid skull plate so that she and her children could buy passage off world. She could not sell it to the Ithorian Fazza Utral because she lacked a hunter's license.[1]
            At some point during the Jedi Civil War, she met the amnesiac Revan. They discussed the wraid plate and her husband's death, and the former Dark Lord purchased the plate from her and gave her an additional two hundred credits.[1]
            The gift of additional two hundred credits to Sharina described above is optional (the player still can buy the plate for only five hundred credits without the additional offer), however this decision rewards light side points. If Juhani, Bastila Shan, Carth Onasi, Zaalbar, or Mission Vao are in the player's party at that time, they will make a comment on the Jedi ethics. Canderous Ordo and HK-47 do comment on the Jedi's decision, but do so in a negative manner.[1]
            Alternatively, the player could convince Sharina to hand over the wraid plate so that it could be sold to Fazza. The outcome can still depend on the player's decision, even the canonical one.[1]
            A non-canonical dark side option is to persuade Sharina to sell for half price. This offers dark side points, as it involves personal profit. Another dark-sided option is to take the plate from her by threats or via Force persuasion.[2]
            The player was originally supposed to be able to meet up with Sharina on Dantooine if they helped her on Tatooine, but this feature was cut from the game.

            Early in the war, she accompanied a research team to Niriktavi Bay on Taratos IV, despite the misgivings of her mother, Mata Fhernan. While there, the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded the planet, and murdered most of her colleagues and took her captive. She was given to Lok Durd, who forced her to create a bioweapon that would turn organic matter to mush. She later met the two Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Skywalker promised to free her and to save her loved ones that the Confederacy kept under constant surveillance. Durd found out about the arrangement and threatened her nephews, finally convincing Fhernan to give the two Jedi up to Durd. Although the Jedi, informed by Skywalker and Kenobi of Fhernan and her family, managed to rescue all but one of her friends and family, Fhernan remained unaware of their safety and continued to work for Durd, eventually resulting in a terrorist attack on Chandrila using her weaponry.
            Fhernan immediately regretted allowing herself to be controlled by her loved ones, constantly thinking about how many mothers and fathers had been lost on Chandrila to innocent civilians. In the midst of this, the Jedi had sent reinforcements to Skywalker and Kenobi, and Jedi Master Taria Damsin was sent to rescue Fhernan and destroy Durd's compound. Once it was discovered that there would be complications in both setting off the explosives and escaping, Fhernan volunteered to stay behind and set them off herself in an attempt to right all of her wrongs. Damsin agreed, and once she had cleared the area, Fhernan detonated the bombs, killing herself and destroying all of Durd's base.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bant%27ena_Fhernan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBant'enaFhernan</string></dict>

            A Force-sensitive Human, Rori Fenn was trained in the ways of the Force by the Je'daii Order on the planet Tython, one of nine planets in the Tython system which made up the Settled Worlds. As a Journeyer, Fenn had a romantic relationship with fellow Journeyer Hawk Ryo; the pair ended the relationship after they ascended to the rank of Je'daii Ranger.[3] During her life as a Ranger, Fenn carried a single Force-imbued blade as a defense against the wilds of Tython.[2]
            In 25,793 BBY, the Xesh, a Force Hound of the Infinite Empire crashed the Rakatan ship called the Devourer near the Rift on Tython. The surge of deaths associated with the crash alerted all Je'daii to the foreign presence on the world, as well as stirring a Force storm that would rage across the entire planet. Fenn immediately went to the Temple of Balance, Akar Kesh to consult with Temple Master Ketu regarding the anomalies spreading across the world. Dispatched by Master Ketu to the crash site in Pteron gliders, Fenn accompanied fellow Ranger Hawk Ryo and Temple Master Quan-Jang to the Rift in search of survivors. Despite being attacked briefly by a pair of saarl, the Je'daii arrived safely at the site where they were able to transmit a vid-feed back to Temple Master Kora Ryo at the Temple of Knowledge, Kaleth.[2]
            Discovering the broken hilts of three Je'daii Journeyers' swords, Fenn and Ryo paired up on the back of a bipedal mount and delved deep into the Rift in search of their wayward Je'daii while Master Quan-Jang surveyed the area on the back of a mutated rancor-dragon named Butch.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rori_Fenn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRoriFenn</string></dict>

In 10 BBY, Fenris spent time on the planet Vandor where she ran a scam that involved exporting Vandor ice and selling it as valuable R'alla mineral water. After the smuggler Han Solo made the Kessel Run in only 12 parsecs, Fenris claimed he had done it by flying between two black holes in the Maw Cluster. She declared that she would find the route and claim it for her own, but then began avoiding the topic when anyone brought it up.
            Astrid Fenris was a smuggler from Yir Tangee who spent time on the icey planet Vandor during the reign of the Galactic Empire. While there, she ran a scam in which she exported relatively worthless Vandor ice and then sold it to gullible customers as expensive R'alla mineral water, which they believed had rejuvenating properties.[1]
            In the year 10 BBY,[3] Fenris was present in the drinking establishment known as the Lodge in the settlement of Fort Ypso on Vandor and was stood speaking to another human when the smuggler Han Solo and the Crimson Dawn lieutenant Qi'ra passed them while discussing a sabacc game Solo had just lost.[2]
            Solo and his colleagues later made the Kessel Run in a record twelve parsecs on the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon, causing much debate amongst spacers who knew the route, including Fenris. She was incorrectly dubious of the route Solo claimed to have used and wrote a note in a book kept by Midnight—a barkeeper at the Lodge—claiming she would prove he had taken a different route.[4]
            Her theory was that Solo had flown the freighter between two black holes in the Maw Cluster, and therefore the credit for the run should go to the gambler Lando Calrissian, who owned the ship at the time and so had been responsible for any modifications that allowed it to survive the pull of the black holes. After she declared her intent to find Solo's route and claim it for her own, patrons began asking her is she had tested her theory yet each time she visited the Lodge. As Fenris was unable to determine which of the two many black holes in the Maw Solo had supposedly used, she began avoiding the topic and would quickly become interested in any other subject when asked about it.[4]
            Fenris inisited that her Vandor ice scam was only a short-term scheme which she needed to carry out in order to pay off several debts.[1] She had fair skin, brown eyes and white hair,[2] which she wore in a Mandalorian-style bob haircut.[1]
            Fenris piloted a modified YT-2400 freighter known as the Silver Howl. While on Vandor she wore a brown synth-hide capelet with concealed pockets over a tan shirt and a pair of black pants. She also wore a belt with a holster in which she carried a Ophidiax-350 heavy blaster pistol.[1]
            Astrid Fenris first appeared in the 2018 Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story[2] and was first identified in the accompanying reference guide Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Astrid_Fenris</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAstridFenris</string></dict>

            At some point, the Iktotchi Imperial Knight Eshkar Niin attempted to kill her on the rooftop of a city building in the presence of his apprentice Antares Draco. Although the Empress did manage to defend herself with a lightsaber for some time, she was slain by the treacherous knight. Draco then attacked Niin with the intention of killing him. Although Draco seemingly did so, Niin in fact faked defeat and death to escape. He would later become Darth Havok of Darth Krayt's One Sith.
            Elliah's death also put a major strain on the Empire's relations with the Hapes Consortium. The Hapans saw her death as Roan Fel's fault, since Niin was his knight.
            While it's not implicitly established in the Legacy comics, the fact that Hapans publicly took offense to her death seems to suggest a connection to the Hapes Consortium, or even to the Hapan Royal House considering the political repercussions. A similar ambiguity is that although she wielded an Imperial Knight lightsaber against Niin, it has been left unstated whether or not she was an Imperial Knight herself, or even Force-sensitive.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Elliah_Fel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemElliahFel</string></dict>

Fenris' personal starfighter was the Red Ace.
            Freya Fenris was a skilled racing pilot,[3] and by 34 ABY,[source?] her skills had earned her a place among the Ace Squadron of the Colossus platform on the ocean planet Castilon,[3] flying her ship, the Red Ace.[4]
            As one of the Aces, she both raced and helped defend the platform from attack. When pirates led by Kragan Gorr attacked the station, she led fellow Aces Torra Doza, Hype Fazon and Bo Keevil in fighting off the pirates. They fought well, despite being outnumbered. When the pirates retreated, Fenris attributed the victory to the Aces' skill, although Doza had doubts, suspecting another factor. Unbeknownst to both women, Doza was correct, as Kazuda Xiono, a Resistance spy recently sent to the Colossus, had covertly aided the pilots by broadcasting feedback over the pirates' communications channel.[5]
            Some time later, she led Keevil and Griff Halloran in escorting in a fuel freighter while the Colossus was under a power outage. Such missions were another standard part of the Aces' duties.[6]

        <key>Toryn Farr</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.141.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Toryn Farr was a Human female who served as a chief communications officer in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. In 3 ABY, she was stationed in Echo Base on the planet Hoth.
            Toryn Farr and her sister Samoc were raised on the planet of Chandrila within a family that was loyal to Mon Mothma. Opposed to the Galactic Empire, Farr's family enlisted the help of Chandrilan authorities and staged a transport crash, in which a number of children were supposedly killed, including the Farr sisters. The girls were taken offworld and they joined the Rebellion. Farr's sister, Samoc, became a skilled pilot and the two were stationed in Echo Base.[1] As Chief Controller of Echo Command, Farr's primary duties included monitoring space surrounding Hoth and relaying orders to troops and vessels in the field.
            During the Battle of Hoth, she commanded the base's ion cannon when to fire on Imperial ships in orbit. Most notably, she gave the command which disabled the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Tyrant, allowing the first GR-75 medium transport, the Quantum Storm, to escape through the blockade, which served as the opening shots of the engagement.
            Toryn was among the last Rebels to abandon Echo Base, leaving her station only after Princess Leia Organa ordered the final evacuation. After broadcasting the evacuation code signal to the surviving soldiers and pilots still engaging the Imperial assault force, she was the final person to leave the command center. Toryn escaped on the last transport to leave Hoth, the Bright Hope.
            Prior to boarding the transport, Toryn was stunned to see a large number of badly wounded soldiers still lying on the flight deck before the ship. Among the wounded was her sister, Samoc Farr, a talented snowspeeder pilot. Knowing her sister had been shot down led her to the realization of how truly horrific the battle outside had been.
            Toryn was instrumental in buying the wounded just enough time to board the transport before invading snowtroopers descended on the hangar. However, the time it took to load all the wounded onto the ship would prove to be the undoing of the Bright Hope, as it was quickly disabled during its blockade run before being able to make the jump to hyperspace.
            Crippled and drifting through space with little hope of escape, Toryn assumed command of the survivors and implemented a plan to save as many Rebel lives as possible. Three escape pods holding eighteen of the most valuable personnel to the Rebel cause were launched back to Hoth, in the hopes they might survive.
            Before the Imperials were able to capture the survivors of the Bright Hope, the ship was boarded by the bounty hunters Zuckuss and 4-LOM. They masqueraded as rescuers, when they were actually responsible for firing on the Bright Hope and preventing its escape. The truth behind their facade was to take the Rebels and use them as bait to capture Han Solo, and later, turn him in to Darth Vader.
            Following a brief melee, Toryn convinced the bounty hunters to take all ninety remaining Rebels on board and deliver them to the Rebel underground on Darlyn Boda. Before evacuating the ship, she dutifully erased all computer records on board, preventing vital information from falling into Imperial hands, including the names of many personnel who served at Echo Base.
            After spending a month on Darlyn Boda following her escape from Hoth, Toryn finally rejoined the Rebel fleet at the secret rendezvous point. For her brave efforts in assuming command to rescue the survivors of the Bright Hope, she was promoted to the rank of Commander in a ceremony led by General Carlist Rieekan aboard the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Redemption.
            She was also given command of a group of Alliance Special Forces, with her first mission being to rescue the eighteen members of the Bright Hope who were jettisoned back to Hoth.
            Toryn Farr was played by Brigitte Kahn. A woman who looks similar in appearance to Farr is featured in A New Beginning, but there was no indication that this particular controller was the same character.
            Farr introduced the Raid Battles during the limited-time Operation Hoth Defensive Event in the 2013 card game app Star Wars: Force Collection. She was assigned Jobin's line.

As Empress, Fel embarked on an ambitious communications infrastructure project, called the G51 communications array network, to link the Outer Rim Territories with the rest of the galaxy, and initiated a campaign to hunt down war criminals. Fel also had to contend with the threat of the insurgent One Sith and the rogue Sith Darth Wredd, who wanted to restore the Rule of Two. In 139 ABY, she led the Imperial Knights to victory over the One Sith during the Battle of the Floating World.
            Marasiah Fel was the daughter of Roan Fel, the third Emperor of the Fel Empire. Some Moffs made no secret of their doubts about a woman being in line to take the throne, but like her father, Princess Marasiah was trained as an Imperial Knight, although she had not received a formal knighting when Darth Krayt and Grand Admiral Morlish Veed began their machinations to seize control of the Empire. By the time of the Attack on Emperor Fel in 130 ABY, Marasiah was already secreted away on Bastion. Marasiah acted as an emissary between her father and Imperial systems, often infiltrating planets in secret in order to determine the loyalty of the officers governing there. Due to her work, Fel became fluent in several languages including Basic, Bocce, High Galactic and Huttese.[6]
            In 137 ABY, Sia, her bodyguard Imperial Knight Elke Vetter and her guide Astraal Vao were attacked while at the Imperial Mission on Socorro by Darth Talon, acting as Hand for Darth Krayt. Beating Vetter in one-on-one lightsaber combat, Talon tortured the Imperial Knight before finally killing her with Force lightning. Princess Marasiah felt the death of her instructor and friend through the Force and was torn between seeking revenge for Elke's death and escaping to continue and banned with her mission. Sia was personally troubled that one of her mentors had laid down her life for her. She did not realize that she was of little importance to the One Sith, who merely saw her as a way to find her father.[4]
            The path of Sia and Astraal's escape led them to the Mynock and Cade Skywalker. She demanded immediate passage and promised to reimburse them in return for their services. But the bounty hunter wanted credits up front, so Sia "ordered" him but it didn't work as he was once a Jedi. But at the sight of the Sith, Cade initiated emergency take-off procedures and blasted off Socorro. The two women hoped to make a rendezvous with Astraal's brother Shado on Vendaxa, but the self-serving Cade had other ideas, specifically the bounty on Marasiah and her father's heads, planning on delivering her to her father and then sell their hideaway to the Sith.[7]
            Arriving on Vendaxa, Sia and the crew of the Mynock were attacked by an acklay. The timely arrival of Shado Vao and Wolf Sazen stopped the animal, and Sia made arrangements to travel with the two Jedi. And she already guessed that the pirates knew her identity. She was willing to give them creds for transfer into their accounts—once she and the Jedi have left Vendexa and them. But a sudden attack by Darth Talon prevented them from escaping, and Marasiah confronted the Sith before she could kill Wolf Sazen. Her attempt at revenge for the murder of her master, Elke Vetter, was short-lived, as Talon Force pushed her away easily. Cade Skywalker intervened, throwing Talon into the forest with the Force, and led the party to the Mynock, but the ship had been sabotaged by Talon prior to her attack, stranding them on Vendaxa.[8]
            While waiting for repairs on the Mynock, it was revealed to her that Cade was a Skywalker. She approached him about the subject and told him how she wished she could just disappear from her destiny too. But she also told him that she would not run away from her responsibilities.[8] When Imperial Knights arrived they were shot down, but survived the crash. Marasiah joined the other knights in the fight along with Cade. Marasiah condemned Antares Draco during their fight with the Sith for coming, knowing that her father would never send a rescue mission. When Draco confessed his love for her she told him, "I know."[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Marasiah_Fel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMarasiahFel</string></dict>
        <key>Fanry</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.144.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Fanry was a human female princess and the Queen of Pijal during the era of the Galactic Republic.[1] Born around 54 BBY,[2] Fanry was fourteen years old by the time of her succession to the royal throne. After her coronation, Fanry planned to lead a revolt against Czerka Arms, opposing the corporation's influence in the Pijal system. She also intended to act without the support of the Jedi Order or the Republic, convinced the latter was compromised by Czerka Corporation's wealth and influence. As queen, she believed it was her responsibility to free her planet.[1]
            But while attempting to destroy the Czerka Corporation cruiser Leverage, Fanry refused to help the slaves on board the starship. As a result, her servant Cady and the crew of the royal flagship Righteous rebelled against the queen. The queen's revolution was unsuccessful, consequently leading to Fanry's abdication of the throne. The crown therefore passed to her cousin Lamia, who signed a treaty abolishing slavery in the Pijali's home system and ending the Pijali monarchy.[1]
            Fanry first appeared in the canon novel Master &amp; Apprentice, which was written by Claudia Gray and published in 2019.[1] Gray imagined Fanry as being portrayed by actress Sadie Sink.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fanry</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemFanry</string></dict>

        <key>Fy-Tor-Ana</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.147.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Fy-Tor-Ana was a female Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order as an instructor at the Coruscant Jedi Temple during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. After the start of the Great Jedi Purge and establishment of the New Order, Solace was the name she gave herself when she hid underneath the bedrock of Coruscant. Believed to be a location, Solace was discovered by former Jedi Ferus Olin to be the Jedi Master.
            A Human Force-sensitive[4], Fy-Tor-Ana was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, ascending to the rank of Jedi Master after crafting a green-bladed lightsaber and completing the Trials of Knighthood. While a respected Jedi she was known as reclusive, rarely interacting with her fellow instructors and refusing to take a Padawan for herself. Renowned for her split-second reflexes, her grace, and her agility, Master Ana was appointed as an instructor at the Coruscant Jedi Temple by the Jedi High Council. Teaching the technique known as the Art of Movement to Jedi Initiates at the Temple academy, Master Ana's classes occupied the obstacle course. During her time as an instructor, Master Ana instructed countless Initiates, including a young Obi-Wan Kenobi.[5]
            A survivor of the Clone Wars, a bloody conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Master Ana was forced into hiding when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army of the Republic, effectively disbanding the Jedi Order. Fleeing the slaughter of the Great Jedi Purge, Master Ana took shelter on the Jedi-world Ilum with fellow Master Garen Muln. Hiding amongst the frozen wastelands' Crystal Caves, Ana was not able to remain ignorant of the state of the Republic for long and soon departed Ilum alone for Coruscant. When Ana did not return, Master Muln feared that she was dead. Muln relayed his information on Fy-Tor-Ana's plans to former Jedi Ferus Olin who had visited Ilum in search of survivors; Olin then left for Coruscant to find the missing Jedi.[3]
            In fact, Master Ana had made it to Coruscant and, finding the Jedi Temple in ruins, was forced underground. Delving deep into the crust of the ecumenopolis, Master Ana assumed control of a settlement established above an expansive subterranean ocean. Taking the name of Solace, Master Ana's existence became mythical, leaving the Jedi behind her and striving to assist those fleeing persecution by the Galactic Empire. When Ferus Olin arrived on Coruscant, he heard rumors that Ana was held in the bowels of the Temple. Finding the Temple occupied by stormtroopers but vacant of all Jedi, he followed rumors down to the crust and began seeking what he believed to be a settlement known as Solace. A guide met him at the mouth of the subterranean passage and led Olin down to the hidden city, only then revealing her identity as the former Jedi Master.[3]
            Rather derisive when Olin attempted to get her to return to the Temple, Ana was finally convinced when Olin explained that Imperial Inquisitor Malorum had planted a spy in her midst. Agreeing to help Olin and his associate Trever Flume infiltrate the Jedi Temple and eliminate Malorum's chances of locating them, she led them into the Temple's heart only to find themselves trapped by Imperials. When they were ambushed, Ana was forced to abandon Olin while escorting the young Flume back out of the Temple, returning to her settlement in the midst of an attack. With her new world burning, she was able to rally survivors and flee to the surface.[3] Master Ana and Flume, joined by the Bothan Oryon and former reporter Keets Freely journeyed to Dexter Jettster's hideout and asked him for help finding Olin. They located him on a ship with his friend Clive Flax, escaping the prison world of Dontamo. They followed Malorum to the planet of Naboo and were aided by Boss Rugor Nass and the Gungans in their attempt to take back Naboo.[6]
            Later, when Olin had to help Emperor Palpatine on the planet Samaria, Master Ana went to Bellassa to rescue Roan Lands and Dona Telamark, two of Olin's friends, from execution. She went with Oryon and Flume and got help from The Eleven, and was able to succeed. They went to Samaria to help Olin save Astri Oddo and her son Lune from stormtroopers. They all escaped except Olin, who stayed on the planet, knowing that Palpatine would have more things for him to do. In their down time, the Jedi and their crew of misfits based themselves on a hidden asteroid near to Bellassa, preparing it for Olin's dream to locate Jedi survivors there.[7]
            When the asteroid was finally discovered by the Empire, Masters Ana and Muln assured that the young Lune Divinian made it off before the Imperials unleashed the fury of their secret superweapon, destroying the asteroid and the Jedi. Before her death, Master Ana was at peace with the Force and her allies, proud to die as a Jedi amongst friends.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fy-Tor-Ana</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemFyTorAna</string></dict>

        <key>Phasma</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.150.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Phasma was a human female stormtrooper captain of the First Order. Phasma grew up as a member of the Scyre clan on the nuclear-ravaged world of Parnassos. She was a formidable warrior who became the clan's military leader. Seeking passage offworld, Phasma helped the First Order General Brendol Hux find his ship in the process betraying her own brother Keldo and clan. After being rescued, Phasma joined the First Order, abandoning her former life on Parnassos.
            Over the years, Phasma rose through the ranks of the First Order and became in charge of their stormtrooper training program. She conspired with Brendol's son General  Armitage Hux to assassinate her former benefactor. Phasma also survived an assassination attempt by Brendol's former protege Cardinal, who sought revenge for Brendol's death. Having consolidated her position within the First Order, Phasma became part of an unofficial triumvirate consisting of General Hux and the dark enforcer Kylo Ren.
            As a senior officer, Phasma commanded First Order forces in their struggle against the Resistance. Under orders from the Supreme Leader of the First Order, Snoke, the triumvirate searched for a galaxy map that would lead to the last of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker, on the planet Jakku. Phasma participated in a massacre at Tuanul village, an atrocity which led the stormtrooper FN-2187 to defect to the Resistance.
            Following the Hosnian Cataclysm, Phasma was ambushed by FN-2187, now with the Resistance as Finn, who had infiltrated Starkiller Base with the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca. Surviving the Battle of Starkiller Base, Phasma framed Lieutenant Sol Rivas for the base's destruction and led a mission to hunt down the fugitive in order to conceal her own malfeasance. During the pursuit of the Resistance fleet, Phasma fought with Finn aboard the First Order flagship Supremacy, which had been devastated by a hyperspace ramming attack. However, Phasma was bested by her former soldier and fell to her death into the flames that were consuming the stricken ship.
            Prior to joining the Scyre clan, Phasma and her older brother Keldo were part of a small and weak family that resided directly around the Nautilus on the desolate planet Parnassos. Phasma and Keldo grew up having to defend the families territory from raid from the Scyre and the Claw. One day Phasma orchestrated the deaths of her clan including her father and mother in order to ensure both herself and Keldo survived while still being able to live in the Nautilus.[1]
            In order to do this, she stabbed Keldo in the foot with a knife and pushed him into a cave, thus disabling him, claiming that the family was under attack and that she had saved his life. Following the battle, the Scyre leader Egil gave Phasma and Keldo the choice of joining his tribe. In order to survive, Phasma and Keldo pledged their allegiances to the Scyre by painting themselves with oracle salve prepared by Siv and her mother Vala from the remains of their parents. In truth, Keldo and Phasma knew that the latter had conspired with the Scrye to murder their own family.[1]
            Due to Parnassos' harsh environment and lack of technological advancements, Phasma spent her days wearing protective gear and scavenging crashed starships for weapons and supplies. By the age of sixteen, Phasma was considered an accomplished warrior. She also became the leader of the Scyre clan's warriors and believed herself to be the strongest warrior on Parnassos. Her followers included Torben, Carr, Siv, and Gosta.[1]
            When she was sixteen, a young upstart named Porr fatally wounded the Scrye leader Egil and claimed leadership of the clan. He also demanded that Siv bring the detraxor to extract nutrients from the dying Egil. Porr was opposed by Keldo who condemned him for attacking their leader without challenging him to combat. When Porr defied Keldo, Phasma supported her brother.[1]
            Porr offered to make Phasma his deputy if she submitted to him. However, Phasma and her loyal warriors refused to accept Porr's leadership. Phasma and Porr fought for leadership of the Scrye, with Phasma wielding a spear and Porr a long dagger. Eventually, Phasma managed to knock Porr to the ground. Before Phasma could finish him off, Keldo sliced the tendons of Porr's ankles, permanently hobbling him.[1]
            Keldo forced Porr to submit to him and his sister Phasma. Porr accepted defeat and Phasma ordered Siv to use the detraxors on the fallen Egil. Together, Phasma and Keldo became co-leaders of the Scrye. While the crippled Keldo served as the clan's political leader, Phasma served as their military leader.[1]
            Two years later, the Scyre clan had a five year old child named Frey, the daughter of Ylva. Frey helped scavenge for frogs, urchins, and eggs for the clan. Phasma also taught Frey how to fight and crafted a child-sized ax out of stone and driftwood. Due to the high infant mortality rate, children were prized by the people of Parnassos. Frey drew the attention of the Claws, who were led by the Dug Balder.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Phasma</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemPhasma</string></dict>
        <key>Norra Wexley</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.151.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Norra Wexley (née Susser) was a female rebel pilot from the planet Akiva who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and New Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Endor, she returned to Akiva to reunite with her estranged teenage son Temmin Wexley but was drawn into a mission to rescue the captured New Republic pilot Wedge Antilles. Joining forces with Temmin, his B1 battle droid "Mister Bones", the bounty hunter Jas Emari, and the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, Norra and her makeshift rebel band sparked an uprising against the Empire on Akiva, disrupted the Imperial Future Council, and helped rescue Wedge Antilles. While attempting to apprehend the Imperial Admiral Rae Sloane, her TIE fighter was hit by burning debris from Sloane's shuttle. After recovering from her injuries, Norra, her son, and their companions joined the New Republic soldier Jom Barell in hunting down Imperial war criminals.
            Later, Norra and her team undertook a mission at the request of Princess Leia Organa to rescue her husband Han Solo, who had gotten lost while trying to liberate the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. During a raid on Ashmead's Lock, Norra and her team managed to free a hundred rebel prisoners including her husband Brentin. Norra and Temmin's reunion with Brentin was soured after he and the other Ashmead's Lock prisoners were used by the Empire to attack the New Republic leadership. Following the Attack on Chandrila Norra and her team embarked on a hunt for Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, whom they believed was responsible for the attack.
            Norra's pursuit brought her to the barren Inner Rim world of Jakku. After escaping Imperial captivity, she along with Jas and Mister Bones continued their hunt for Sloane. Amidst the cataclysmic Battle of Jakku, Norra caught up with her old adversary Sloane and her estranged husband Brentin. Norra put aside her hostility towards Sloane and Brentin in order to join forces to stop Gallius Rax's plot to destroy Jakku along with the Imperial and New Republic forces. During the battle, Norra managed to reconcile with her husband before his death at the hands of Rax. Following the end of the Galactic Civil War, Norra followed her son Temmin to the New Republic's new flight academy on Hosnian Prime, to become an instructor.
            Norra Wexley was from the planet of Akiva and lived in the capital of Myrra. She was married to Brentin Lore Wexley, who worked with the Rebel Alliance before the Rebel Alliance even formally existed. During the Age of the Empire, Norra and Brentin raised a son named Temmin. When Brentin was arrested and taken away by a group of stormtroopers[1] to be imprisoned at Ashmead's Lock on Kashyyyk,[2] she was left to raise Temmin on her own. Missing her husband, she left her twelve year old son in the care of her older sister Esmelle and joined the Rebel Alliance. She always held out hope that her journeys would help her find her husband again.[1]
            Initially, her role in the Rebel Alliance was as a simple freighter pilot, ferrying people, cargo, or messages across the galaxy. However, before the Battle of Endor, Commander Wedge Antilles spoke to her, requesting that she fly with them in the battle because they desperately needed her piloting skills. She reluctantly accepted, and flew a BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber in the battle as Gold Nine of Gold Squadron. Led by Lando Calrissian, she flew into the second Death Star, drawing the attention of many TIE fighters away from the Millennium Falcon but expecting to die in the process. Although she took a lot of fire and lost her astromech droid, she survived the battle. She received a medal for her service that day, although she was haunted by those memories for a long time afterwards.[1]
            Following the Battle of Endor, Norra returned to her homeworld of Akiva with the goal of reuniting with her son Temmin, whom she had not seen for the past three years, and taking him offworld. Since Akiva was still under Imperial occupation, she hitched a ride aboard the smuggler Owerto Naiucho's freighter Moth. On the way, the Moth was attacked by several TIE fighters. Following a brief dogfight, Norra took control of the ship and managed to evade the fighters and land near Akar Road on the outskirts of Myrra, where her home was located. After escaping the Imperials, Norra acknowledged that she was indeed a rebel pilot and convinced Owerto to fly her and her son offworld.[1]
            Norra's first stop was to visit her sister Esmelle and her wife Shirene. There, she learnt that Temmin was no longer staying with his aunts and had moved back to their former family home. Upon returning to her home, Norra discovered that Temmin had become a junk dealer and had turned their family home into a junk shop. Despite briefly embracing, Norra found that her fifteen year old son still resented her for leaving him behind to find Brentin and join the Rebellion. Due to his line of work, Temmin had frequent contact with underworld elements. He had just "incapacitated" three criminals who had been sent by the Sullustan crime lord Surat Nuat to punish her son for stealing supplies from a wrecked transport. In addition, Temmin had constructed a modified B1 battle droid named "Mister Bones" that served as his companion and bodyguard.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Norra_Wexley</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemNorraWexley</string></dict>

However, before this could come to pass, she and her Master were sent to fight on Jabiim. Sirrus was killed shortly after they were deployed, and she became one of the orphaned Jedi Commanders who comprised the Padawan Pack.
            On the forty-third day of the battle, the battle had finally reached Separatist commander Alto Stratus's stronghold. As the battle raged, the Padawans fell one by one, sometimes together. Aubrie was the last Jedi to stay alive. Taking up the lightsaber of her fallen comrade Vaabesh, she confronted Alto Stratus face-to-face. Wounded from an earlier hit, Stratus had to defend himself from a grounded position. As Aubrie moved in for the kill, Stratus hit her square in the chest with a blaster at point-blank range. As she fell forward, her lightsabers plunged into Stratus' chest, killing him as well.

        <key>Jaesa Willsaam</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.154.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jaesa Willsaam was a Human female Jedi Padawan who studied under the tutelage of Jedi Master Nomen Karr and later the apprentice of the Empire's Wrath, who convinced her to abandon the Jedi Order and join the Sith during the Cold War.
            Jaesa Willsaam was born on Alderaan to Gregor and Parvin Willsaam, and spent her early life as a handmaiden to Gesselle Organa of House Organa. Her family was not wealthy, and her parents had hoped to increase their family's lot when it was decided that she would marry an Organa noble. Fate interceded when her Force-sensitivity manifested itself. Recognizing the tremendous opportunity for their child, her parents allowed her to be taken for training by the Jedi.
            For an unknown length of time, Willsaam was trained in the ways of the Force by Jedi Master Yonlach on Tatooine. During one of her trials, she faced the sand demon unarmed and walked out unscathed.
            But soon Nomen Karr recognized that Willsaam had a unique Force ability, the ability to see and effortlessly determine the true nature of other sentients. In her, Karr saw an opportunity root out and dismantle the intelligence network of his longtime Sith rival, Darth Baras. At her master's behest, Willsaam was able to identify some of Baras' operatives on Balmorra and Nar Shaddaa.
            Her existence and talent–though not her identity–were uncovered by Baras on Dromund Kaas, by torturing the information out of a captured agent of the Republic. Baras quickly assigned his most promising new apprentice to seek out and destroy individuals from Willsaam's past, hoping to draw her out of anonymity.
            After two of the spies she had uncovered were silenced by the Sith apprentice, Willsaam began more and more to feel the approach of the dark side. The Sith soon began tracking down people she was close to. The apprentice first sought out Master Yonlach on Tatooine. Willsaam's old master managed to warn her via their Force bond that the Sith were attempting to draw her out of hiding before he met a painful death. And when Willsaam finally felt her own parents' deaths on Alderaan, she decided to take matters into her own hands. She contacted the Empire's Wrath to arrange a one-on-one meeting without her Master's knowledge.[2]
            Master Karr quickly discovered Willsaam's plan and, after judging it foolish and forbidding her to go through with it, sent Jedi Knights Zylixx and Ulldin to eliminate the Sith threat. The two Knights would prove to be no match for the Sith, and were easily defeated.[2] Karr was finally determined to end the threat to Willsaam's life, and arranged for a duel to the death with Darth Baras on Nal Hutta to resolve their conflict.
            In order both to protect himself and to put Karr off-balance, Baras sent his mighty apprentice to the duel in his stead. As Jedi Master and Sith apprentice clashed, the Sith tricked the old Jedi into falling to the dark side in order to further taunt Willsaam.
            When her Jedi Master was defeated, Willsaam finally emerged from hiding, sensing that he was being tortured and saw her Master in his twisted state. At first, she considered the possibility that Karr had been hiding this all along, but then accused the Warrior of corrupting her Master. The Warrior encouraged her to use her power on Karr to see the truth. Willsaam complied and despite seeing dark traits within Karr, she refused to believe it. The Warrior continued to taunt her into releasing her anger and battled the Padawan, easily able to defeat the young Jedi. Defeated, Willsaam became convinced that Karr's teachings about the light side being stronger than the dark side were nothing but a lie. Karr reminded her that she hasn't completed her training and promises that when she fully communed with the light side of the Force, no Sith could be her match. Nonetheless, Jaesa acknowledged the Warrior's power and was accepted as a Sith apprentice. Her first act was to strike down her former master with her own hands. Though Karr pleaded her not to let the Sith turn her into a murderer, Willsaam coldly retorted that the Jedi hypocritically do likewise to justify their actions, and decapitated Karr.
            Willsaam joined the Sith Warrior as a newly-anointed Sith apprentice when they departed from Nal Hutta. The Warrior was granted the rank of Sith Lord for success in hunting her down, and she became a willing agent of the Empire.
            Their adventures would take them across the galaxy, as they sought to undermine both the Republic and the Jedi, and worked tirelessly to re-ignite open war between the Republic and the Sith Empire. She demonstrated devotion to her Master, vowing never to follow the Sith traditions involving killing the Master. When her Master was chosen as the Emperor's Wrath, Jaesa became excited, knowing that this would place them closer to the Sith Emperor and ultimate power, believing that the Wrath could lead the Empire to glory. Ultimately, Jaesa vowed to stay by her Master's side to help mold future apprentices.
            Eventually, Jaesa became aware that many Sith were leaning towards the light side. With her master's leave, Jaesa used her free time find Sith who followed some aspects of the light side. Eventually, she learned of Lord Cendence, who was tasked by the Dark Council in eliminating light side Sith. However, Jaesa became concerned over Cendence's high kill list. Upon gaining an audience, she quickly realized that Cendence simply killed whomever he wished; very few of his targets were light side Sith. Cendence recognized that Jaesa's power would validate his work. He attempted to convince her to betray her Master but she simply laughed in his face and killed him. Caliqu, the Dark Council's emissary and Cendence's superior, was present at the time and granted Jaesa Cendence's mandate.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jaesa_Willsaam</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJaesaWillsaam</string></dict>
        <key>Beru Whitesun Lars</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.155.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Beru Whitesun Lars, the wife of Owen Lars, was a Tatooinian woman who raised Luke Skywalker after the fall of the Galactic Republic. Coming from a long line of moisture farmers, Beru Whitesun grew up near Mos Eisley on Tatooine. On a trip to Anchorhead, she met Owen Lars, the son of another moisture farmer, Cliegg Lars. Beru and Owen fell in love, and Beru later became part of the Lars family.
            Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Owen's stepmother, Shmi Skywalker Lars, was kidnapped by Tusken Raiders, an event that brought Shmi's son, Anakin Skywalker, and his soon-to-be-wife, Padmé Amidala, to the Lars homestead. Three years later, when the galactic conflict came to a close, Beru and Owen became the guardians of their new baby nephew, Luke Skywalker, after his father turned to the dark side of the Force and became Darth Vader.
            The Larses raised Skywalker like a son. Beru would often defend Skywalker's interests against Owen, who was overprotective of him out of fear that he would follow in Anakin's footsteps. Though Owen refused numerous times to let Skywalker go when he wished to leave home to attend the Imperial Academy with his friend Biggs Darklighter, Beru convinced her husband to let Skywalker go after staying on for only one more season. After a year had passed, Beru tried to convince Owen that it was time to let Skywalker move on, but they never had time to reach an agreement. The two were killed by Imperial stormtroopers, by order of Darth Vader, who were searching for a droid carrying the stolen Death Star plans.
            Growing up near the spaceport city of Mos Eisley on the planet of Tatooine,[5][6] Beru Whitesun was a female Human[1] born in 47 BBY.[2] Her siblings, Dama and Haro, and she came from a family that had been in the moisture farming businesses for three generations.[6][7][8] The Whitesuns had a reputation among the farming families for being particularly well-adapted to Tatooine's rough climate.[9]
            Not long before the onset of the Clone Wars, Whitesun met a young man in Anchorhead named Owen Lars. Lars, also a moisture farmer, lived on a farm with his father, Cliegg Lars, and stepmother, Shmi Skywalker Lars. Whitesun developed a romantic relationship with Owen, and also grew close to his family. Her sister, Dama, would accompany her on visits to the Lars farm, although she would often leave for Anchorhead to visit a beau of her own.[6] While Owen and Whitesun had not yet announced that they were getting married, Shmi could tell that it would only be a matter of time before they would wed. She knew that Whitesun's strong work ethic and easy-going nature would make her a good wife for a moisture farmer. Likewise, Cliegg found a strong verbal sparring partner in Whitesun; she held her own in playfully arguing with "old Cliegg."[4]
            Whitesun was staying with the Larses for a few days when a group of Tusken Raiders and their banthas began approaching the perimeter of the farm.[6] While Cliegg and Owen tried to convince the women that there was nothing to worry about, Beru and Shmi saw through their lies and demanded to hear the truth. The family then prepared for the oncoming attack. When Shmi was kidnapped by the Tuskens, Cliegg and Owen recruited other local farmers to help them go after the Sand People. Many men were killed, and Cliegg lost his right leg, but Shmi was never recovered. Two weeks after she was taken, Whitesun and the Larses tearfully accepted that Shmi was gone.[4]
            A month passed since Shmi's kidnapping. Whitesun was surprised when she finally got the chance to meet Anakin Skywalker, the son Shmi so often spoke of, when the Senator Padmé Amidala and he arrived on Tatooine to see his mother. While Cliegg explained what had happened, Whitesun prepared food and drinks for the guests. She was at Cliegg's when Skywalker set out to find Shmi, and she was the first to spot him on his return from the Tusken camp. When he arrived, she stood next to Owen and sadly watched as Anakin carried his mother's lifeless body into their house. She later helped Amidala prepare a meal for the distraught Skywalker; she asked Amidala what it was like on her homeworld, Naboo, but confessed that she preferred Tatooine and didn't like to travel.[4]
            Beru and the others held a funeral for Shmi, and buried her body on the western edge of the sand berm near the house.[6] Skywalker and Amidala departed Tatooine, taking C-3PO, a droid who had been with the Larses as long as Shmi, along with them.[10] Shortly thereafter, Kitster Banai, a childhood friend of Skywalker's, came to the farm hoping to see his friend. Instead, Beru shared with him the story of the recent events.[6]
            Three years went by, over which time Whitesun and Owen had married, and Cliegg had died and left the farm to them.[6][11] Mere days after the Clone Wars came to an end and Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, the Larses spoke to the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.[12] Kenobi asked them to become the guardians of their nephew, Luke Skywalker, simply telling them that Skywalker's parents were dead, and not giving any details as to how.[12] Although Owen was initially reluctant, the pair agreed after Beru convinced her husband to adopt the boy.[13] Despite the Larses raising the child, Kenobi would live nearby on Tatooine to keep an eye on Skywalker.[14] The Larses told their neighbors that they had given him the name "Skywalker" to honor Owen's late stepmother.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Beru_Whitesun_Lars/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBeruWhitesunLars</string></dict>
        <key>Maketh Tua</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.156.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Minister Maketh Tua was a human female that hailed from the planet Lothal, and was a graduate of the Imperial Academy.
            In the absence of Governor Arihnda Pryce, the Imperial Governor of Lothal, Tua was tasked with overseeing Lothal's industries, making certain they all operated at peak efficiency for the Empire. However, after a string of failures to put down a growing rebellion on her homeworld, Lothal was visited by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, the Imperial Governor of the entire Outer Rim. He berated her and the other Imperial leaders for their failures, even executing Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko and Taskmaster Myles Grint for their incompetence, and took control of the situation himself.
            However, Tarkin's efforts ultimately resulted in the rebels destroying his own flagship, the Sovereign, and the death of the Grand Inquisitor. In retribution, Tarkin ordered Tua to locate the rebels. Despite doubling patrols, setting up security checkpoints, and establishing curfews, she was unable to discover the whereabouts of the cell. In response, the Emperor dispatched his chief enforcer, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, to deal with the situation. Having failed the Grand Moff, she was summoned to meet with him in person the next day to atone for her failure.
            Fearing for her life, she managed to contact the cell and arrange for passage off of Lothal, in exchange for a list of rebel sympathizers provided on Lothal and its neighboring systems, and information regarding the Empire's true mission on Lothal, provided by Kiro Celsius. Vader, however, suspected she would run, and decided to use her to draw out the rebels and lead them to the larger rebellion. Kallus, an agent of the Imperial Security Bureau programmed a spy droid to shadow the minister, and then personally escorted her to her shuttle for her meeting. However, the cell attacked the shuttle that day, and a rebel ordered Tua to board the ship, telling her that they would be right behind her. As she entered the trooper compartment, the vehicle exploded, killing the minister.
            Hailing from Lothal,[5] a backwater planet located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories,[6] Maketh Tua attended the highly touted Imperial Academy in her youth, hoping to escape the limited existence of her homeworld in favor of a grander, more rewarding life. She proved to be a fast learner[5] and became a level-five Academy student.[7] After completing her studies and graduating, she promptly joined the Galactic Empire.[5]
            During the last two months of Governor Ryder Azadi's administration, Maketh Tua served as an assistant minister in his administration. Following Azadi's dismissal and arrest on charges of treason, Tua continued to serve her successor Governor Arihnda Pryce, who ruled Lothal in the name of Emperor Sheev Palpatine. Under Pryce, Tua was appointed as the minister in charge of Lothal's industrial production. A year after Pryce was appointed Governor of Lothal, Tua greeted Governor Pryce when she returned to her homeworld.[8]
            After exchanging pleasantries, Pryce questioned Tua about the 20 percent decline in refinery output over the past four mines. Tua informed her that the mines were being exhausted. She also reported that they were having trouble recruiting miners since Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko had successfully recruited many young people into the Lothal Academy. Pryce ordered her to recruit foreign miners. Upon learning that the doonium vein at Pryce Mining had been exhausted, Pryce ordered Tua to shut down her former family company immediately. At Pryce's request, Tua arranged a meeting with Senator Domus Renking.[8]
            A few months later, Tua met with Governor Pryce to discuss the bidding war between Lothal and Kintoni to host landing and maintenance facilities for the Imperial Navy. While Pryce was content with the current Imperial Navy presence on Lothal, Pryce reiterated that she wanted their homeworld to be the center of Imperial power and industry in this part of the Outer Rim. Pryce then placed Tua in charge of Lothal while she traveled to Coruscant to attend to the bidding war between Lothal and Kintoni; which Lothal ultimately won due to Pryce's political savvy.[8]
            As a minister of Lothal, Tua played a key role in the planet's affiliation with the Empire. One of her initial actions as minister was bringing new government-sponsored housing to Lothal. Those homes were reasonably affordable, and helped the growing population.[9] Later, she attended the going-away party of Dhara Leonis, who had been accepted to the Academy for Young Imperials on Lothal, during which the two spoke.[10]
            During her time as minister, Maketh traveled to the planet Garel aboard the Star Commuter 2000 shuttle ST-45, accompanied by Amda Wabo, a representative of the nearby world of Ando, and two droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO. She had been tasked with picking up some T-7 ion disruptor rifles, which, following their involvement with the attack on Lasan, had been banned throughout the galaxy by the Imperial Senate.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Maketh_Tua</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMakethTua</string></dict>

        <key>Trios</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.160.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Trios was a human female princess who became the Queen of Shu-Torun during the reign of the Galactic Empire. A scion of the royal family, she was the youngest child of the King of Shu-Torun. In the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin, Trios and her elder siblings, Prince Monthan and Princess Hollian, participated in their father's plan to assassinate the Sith Lord Darth Vader during his tour of the royal palace. Vader responded by killing the rebellious king, as well as Monthan and Hollian. Trios' life, however, was spared and, with the deaths of her father and siblings, the crown passed to her. She would rule the planet and its people, but only as a vassal of the Empire.
            Queen Trios' accession to the throne of Shu-Torun was soon followed by the outbreak of a civil war between the new queen's supporters and rebellious members of the nobility. Darth Vader was sent to Shu-Torun once more, this time to enforce Trios' authority and to ensure that the volcanic, resource-rich planet remained under Imperial control. Although Trios was initially disturbed by the Sith's tactics, particularly his decision to destroy one of the delving citadels, she requested that Duke Rubix's citadel become their next target in response to his attack on the royal family's ancestral retreat.
            Trios and Vader were separated while en route to Rubix's citadel. Nevertheless, she oversaw the assault on the fortress and refused to withdraw as the possibility of defeat grew more apparent. After executing her chamberlain, Jooli, for trying to countermand her orders, the queen rallied her loyalist troops and managed to hold out until Vader arrived to turn the tide in their favor. The combined forces of the Shu-Torun Loyalist/Imperial Delving Fleet ultimately secured the decisive victory, bringing an end to the war and the insurrection of the ore-dukes. Following the execution of Rubix, Trios assured Vader that she would eliminate the other rebel dukes for attempting to overthrow her. The Sith Lord departed from Shu-Torun, but not before assigning a stormtrooper captain to serve as the queen's military advisor.
            Princess Trios was born as the third and youngest child of the king of the planet Shu-Torun, a mining world in the Mid Rim. She had two elder siblings, her brother Prince Monthan, who as the eldest child stood to inherit their father's crown upon his death, and her sister Princess Hollian, who would inherit the role of celebrant warlord of the planet's War-Faith. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the planet supplied the Imperials with ore for their many building projects, but when the ore-dukes of Shu-Torun became resistant to the Empire's tithes, the king chose to turn against the Empire.[1]
            When the royal family learned that the Sith Lord Darth Vader was visiting Shu-Torun in order to ensure that the planet's ore quotas were going to be met, the king devised a plan to kill the Imperial representative. Believing he had a surfeit of children, the king decided that Trios would be the one to greet Vader and lead him into a trap set in the royal palace, with a backup plan where she would lead him to die with her in the tunnels within the castle. Trios obeyed her father's commands, and was waiting for Vader with two guards when he landed on one of the palace's landing platforms in his TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. The Sith was displeased that the king himself was not present, but Trios blamed her father's absence on his age and began leading Vader toward the palace's abyssal rooms below the planet's surface, where a ball was being held to showcase Shu-Torun's culture. En route, she offered to have servants take a small package that her guest was carrying, but he refused, stating that he must personally deliver the gift to the ruler of Shu-Torun.[1]
            Upon entering the subterranean hall where the ball was being held, Trios gave the command for those present to begin with the stately Shu-Torun counter-bore waltz. When Vader complained that the dancing was unnecessary, she explained that such practices were an important part of Shu-Torun's culture and were needed to keep the ore-dukes in line. As she and Vader moved across the room, they were stopped by Duke Rubix, who demanded that the Sith Lord dance with his daughter Bixene. Trios advised the duke against pushing the matter, but when he persisted in his demands, Vader used the Force to lift Rubix into the air and whirl him around before dropping him. As Vader questioned if anyone else wished for such a "dance", the king's plan moved into action as a tunneling vessel broke through the hall's ceiling, causing the guests to scatter.[1]
            Pretending to act as rebels opposing both the Empire and the royal family, a number of assassins working for the king exited the craft and attacked Vader. The Sith however, was able to dodge their attacks and then reflect them back at the troops using his lightsaber, killing all of his opponents. With the first part of the plan to kill Vader having failed, Trios dutifully began enacting the second phase, and claiming that the traitors would be watching the lifts, led Vader into the palace's tunnels. As the pair supposedly moved toward the king, Vader complimented Trios, and was still impressed with her when the doors of the tunnel they were in sealed and molten lava began pouring in from the ceiling. He then drew his lightsaber and began cutting a hole through the tunnel's wall, knocking Trios unconscious with a strike to the head when she tried to convince him that there was no escape for either of them.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Trios</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTrios</string></dict>

        <key>Timar Daragon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.162.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Timar Daragon was a female Human starship operator during the years leading up to the Great Hyperspace War. The wife of fellow pilot Hok Daragon, Daragon was the mother of Gav and Jori Daragon, and worked as a supply runner during the Unification Wars of the Koros system with Hok in their ship, the Shadow Runner. In 5000 BBY, the Daragons took a mission to the planet Kirrek during a battle to run supplies to Empress Teta's besieged forces on the world. However, the Shadow Runner was destroyed by pirate forces, killing both Hok and Timar Daragon on impact. After their deaths, the Daragons' other ship, the Starbreaker 12, was bequeathed to Gav and Jori, who later became hyperspace explorers.
            Timar Daragon, a Human female, was married to Hok Daragon. Together, they had two children, Gav and Jori Daragon. In 5000 BBY, during the First Unification Wars in the Koros system, the political leader known as Empress Teta attempted to unify the seven worlds of the system. During this time, the Daragons worked as supply runners to Teta's forces in their ship, the Shadow Runner. Teta's forces managed to unify six of the Koros system's seven worlds into one union. The only planet in the system yet to be unified with the others was Kirrek, where a man named Llaban had put together an army of rebels and pirates. Teta's forces were surprised by the ferocity of Llaban's army, and found themselves besieged in a citadel. The Daragons then went to Aarrba the Hutt, who ran a service dock in the Koros system capital of Cinnagar, to get the Shadow Runner spaceworthy so as to bring relief supplies to the soldiers on Kirrek. The Daragons were grateful for Aarrba's services, and in exchange, the Hutt decided to keep the Daragons' other ship, the Starbreaker 12, as a collateral until they returned. Although Gav and Jori asked their parents if they could assist them on their mission, both Timar and Hok believed that their upcoming mission was too dangerous, so Gav and Jori were forced to stay behind.[1]
            Meanwhile, the battle on Kirrek continued, with the Tetan forces receiving aid from two Jedi in Teta's service, Jedi Master Memit Nadill and the Draethos scholar Odan-Urr. On Odan-Urr's suggestion, the two made use of an exotic Force power known as battle meditation, which allowed the Jedi to demoralize the pirate forces and lift the spirits of the Tetan fighters. Desperate, the pirates began to fire on the weakest incoming targets, hoping to eliminate as many as they could before they were defeated. The Shadow Runner reached Kirrek soon after this order was given, and the ship was promptly set upon by the pirate gun turrets. The Daragons decided to fly in low and fast so as to drop their cargo and get out of the war zone as quickly as possible, but the Shadow Runner's evasive action was hindered by the cargo's weight. Caught in a crossfire, the Shadow Runner was destroyed, and both of the Daragons were killed. The Tetan forces ultimately won the battle, and Teta succeeded in unifying the whole of the Koros system. After the Daragons' death, Aarrba gave Gav and Jori the Starbreaker 12, and the two vowed to honor their parents by exploring the galaxy.[1] This proved to be a pivotal moment in galactic history, as Gav and Jori eventually took a blind hyperspace jump and discovered the Sith, sparking the Great Hyperspace War.[2]
            Timar Daragon was a daring individual, accepting a very dangerous mission to Kirrek while knowing full well of the risks, but quickly panicked when attacked by the pirates. Daragon cared greatly for her children and was mindful of their safety, refusing to allow them to accompany her and Hok to Kirrek on the grounds that it was too dangerous. Both she and Hok were considered skilled pilots by their children.[1]
            Timar Daragon made her first and only appearance in Tales of the Jedi: The Golden Age of the Sith 0: Conquest and Unification. In 2008, she and her husband Hok received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timar_Daragon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTimarDaragon</string></dict>
        <key>Rose Tico</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.163.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rose Tico was a female human who served in the Resistance as a maintenance worker during their conflict with the First Order, whom Tico had hated since she was a child. Tico's older sister, Paige, was a gunner in the Resistance.
            Rose Tico and her older sister Paige grew up on Hays Minor, a impoverished mining colony in the Otomok system. The First Order forced her people to mine their planet's resources to feed their war machine, then shelled them to test the results. Having lost everything they had to the First Order, Rose and her sister joined the Resistance to avenge their homeworld.[1]
            After being transfered to the Resistance cruiser Raddus, Rose spent a long time reading through how it worked. Another mechanic named Lazslo mocked her by saying she never did any hard work, just sat there and read. Paige then told her to go to sleep, but Rose continued, stating that she had to keep reading as some commands were even in Calamarian. When First Order ships appeared and Poe Dameron was trapped outside the ship with the hangar door being unable to open, Rose helped him by figuring out the problem and opening the door. Everyone thanked her and in the end, all the reading paid off.[6]
            Rose Tico and her sister were both active fighters in General Leia Organa's Resistance. Her older sister Paige was a gunner on the Resistance bomber Cobalt Hammer, which served as part of Cobalt Squadron.[1] While Rose was a mechanic, both siblings were very close; they each wore matching pendants around their necks at all times. Paige died in the Battle of D'Qar, which greatly upset Rose, who was aboard the Raddus during the evacuation.[4]
            She was stationed in the Raddus' escape-pod bay to prevent any deserters from escaping during the ensuing battle between the First Order and Resistance fleets.[4]
            Finn, in an attempt to warn Rey of the critical danger that the Resistance now faced, attempted to leave the Raddus and make contact with her by stealing one of the escape pods.[4]
            When Rose caught Finn trying to escape she was initially flustered at meeting a "Resistance hero," not realizing his intent to leave. When she did finally notice his packed bag, she stunned him with an electro-shock prod, put him on a cart and attempted to drag him to the brig, believing him to be one of many attempting to desert in light of the overwhelming odds the Resistance was facing.
            When Finn came to, he tried to convince her that he was not merely a deserter but was trying to warn his friend of the direness of the Resistance's situation, pointing out the fact that the Raddus would be tracked by the First Order through hyperspace, chasing them down until they ran out of fuel and were destroyed.[4]
            Rose realized that the First Order must be using a tracking device aboard the Supremacy. With Rose's knowledge of mechanics and Finn's knowledge of First Order ships, the two devised a plan to shut down the tracking device and allow the Raddus to escape into hyperspace. They informed Dameron of their plan to infiltrate the Supremacy, although they did not know how to decrypt the ship's computer codes to be able to gain access to the ship itself. Dameron called Maz Kanata, who referred them to a "master codebreaker" that they would be able to find on Cantonica.[4]
            Without permission from acting commander Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, Finn, Rose, and BB-8 took a ship and traveled to the casino city of Canto Bight. While Finn marveled at the superficial beauty of the city, Rose understood the darkness hiding underneath. She pointed out that many of these rich people and gamblers had come into their fortunes by selling weapons and goods to the First Order, or otherwise had profited from war and the suffering of others. She also pointed out to him the blatant abuse of the fathiers and their child caretakers, expressing a desire to shatter their hollow and selfish town.[4]
            Rose and Finn continued to search for the "master codebreaker," and thought they had identified him by the pin he wore on his lapel, but they were arrested by the Canto Bight Police for parking their ship on a private beach.[4]
            While in prison, they met a mysterious figure who claimed to be able to get them onto the Supremacy undetected. Rose and Finn politely declined. The man shrugged it off and proceeded to open the door of their cell with a lockpick.[4]
            Now free, Finn and Rose escaped through the sewer system of the city, emerging in the fathier stables. There, Rose secured the allegiance of the young slave Temiri Blagg by showing him her Resistance ring, which she then gave to him before they released the animals and the herd stampeded through the city, leaving a wave of destruction in their wake.[4]

        <key>Darra Thel-Tanis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.167.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darra Thel-Tanis, also known as Darra Haariden,[4] was a female Human Jedi Padawan of Master Soara Antana in the waning years of the Republic Classic era. In 27 BBY, she and her master joined fellow Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi with his Padawan Anakin Skywalker (who was her same age), Siri Tachi with Ferus Olin, and Ry-Gaul with Tru Veld on a mission to the planet Radnor, where some deadly toxins were accidentally released into the atmosphere, resulting in a bioplague. The Jedi were briefed and tasked by the Jedi Council to aid the evacuation of the surviving Radnorans from the Twin Cities Tacto and Aubendo.[3]
            A Human female, Thel-Tanis was taken to the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant due to her being Force-sensitive. There, she was to be trained to become a Jedi Knight. Around 27 BBY, she was taken as an apprentice by the Jedi Master Soara Antana, who was famous for her skill with a lightsaber.[3]
            With her Master, Darra accompanied Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi on missions to worlds such as Radnor (her first mission) and Haariden. On the mission to Haariden, Thel-Tanis was badly injured, after being shot in the thigh with a blaster. During her recovery she developed a friendship with Skywalker.[5] At some point before 24 BBY, Thel-Tanis was sent together with Skywalker on a mission to Norah, where she was wounded again.[6]
            Soara Antana gently unwound the ribbon in Darra's Padawan braid as she wept over her beloved apprentice. Darra's death deeply saddened her fellow Padawans. Olin blamed himself for her death and left the Jedi Order after this mission because of guilt, but not before strengthening the bonds of his friendship with fellow Padawan Tru Veld.[7]
            Darra Thel-Tanis was described as a slender girl with lively, rust-colored eyes and hair that is described both as auburn and as a combination of bright copper and gold. While she impressed others as being kind and polite, she was also very cheerful, of quick and sarcastic wit, and "crackled" with a positive energy that could almost be felt when she was near. She furthermore possessed "a cool grace" that Anakin Skywalker admired, and she was especially skilled at not favoring one hand over the other, when Jedi were required, as per their lightsaber training, to switch their Jedi weapons from the right hand to the left.[3]
            Darra's lightsaber fighting style―graceful, fluid, in constant motion, perfectly planned and executed, seemingly effortless―was testament to her superb training by Jedi Master Soara Antana. Darra's concentration and combat discipline were unparalleled.[3] She also developed her talent for communications, such as the ability to "jam" varied and complex signals—a sensitive gift at which she became an expert.[5]
            Darra, always a vivid presence among the apprentices, seems to have undergone a change, however, following her experience on Haariden, when she was wounded in battle. Thereafter, a new maturity and a hardened sense of purpose marked her actions and demeanor. She seemed to Anakin Skywalker to carry a sense of gravity along with her trademark humor. The incident on Haariden had brought death so close, she told Anakin, that she'd made friends with it—a remark that was meant to have been a joke, but a joke that was weighted with a seriousness that Skywalker had trouble accepting. Anakin wanted the old, wise-cracking Darra back, whose jokes were simply jokes, not keys to her own sorrows. Indeed, even Anakin's Master noted while journeying to their final mission together on Korriban, that the accustomed exuberance that had danced in Darra's unusual, rust-colored eyes would often shift to a shadowy sadness.[7]
            Darra was fond of having a piece of bright fabric, or ribbon, woven through her Padawan braid.[3][7]
            Darra Thel-Tanis was created by the author Jude Watson and first appeared in her young readers novel, Jedi Quest: The Way of the Apprentice. She remained a major character in the series and was killed in the final installment, Jedi Quest: The Final Showdown.[5][6]
            Darra's alternate surname 'Haariden' appears to be a writing error, perhaps slipping through in final edits from earlier working drafts, as the name appears only once in the Jedi Quest novels (whereas 'Thel-Tanis' appears repeatedly), but also in conjunction with a mention in the very next sentences of the character being wounded on a mission―the same mission in which her friend Anakin Skywalker says was the last time that he'd seen Darra for any significant duration of time before working with her on Coruscant to foil a joint heist-assassination attempt by Omega and Zan Arbor. As a surname for Darra, the name is given no in-story explanation or rationale. The fact that readers last engaged with Thel-Tanis on a mission with Skywalker to the planet also called 'Haariden', where she was also wounded (a key incident involving Skywalker that proved an important character-development point in both that earlier story and a subsequent tale[5][7]) also points to the surname 'Haariden' being an early designation in Jude Watson's development of the wide story-arc that became her eleven-book Jedi Quest series. In the three sentences that appear together in Jedi Quest: The False Peace―which mention Darra's alternate surname, her wound, and her mission―the planet where that mission with Anakin took place is named 'Norah,' perhaps also an early discarded name, for, as with the alternate surname, it nowhere thereafter appears as a planet-name in the corpus of Star Wars Legends. It appears that Watson simply renamed Darra 'Thel-Tanis', swapping her original surname 'Haariden' with the planet where she was ultimately wounded on her mission with Skywalker―with later book drafts of the continuing storyline simply escaping the name changes, the original designations slipping their way into print.[6] The last volume in the Jedi Quest series, The Final Showdown―sequel to The False Peace―poignantly references only Thel-Tanis' wound that she received on her mission to Haariden, with no mention of the supposed intervening planet, mission, wound or alternate surname.[7] Nor does Watson, even in her capstone Last of the Jedi series, ever again mention the alternate nomenclature specific to Darra's character.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darra_Thel-Tanis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDarraThelTanis</string></dict>
        <key>Letta Turmond</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.168.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Letta Turmond was a Human female who lived in the final years of the Galactic Republic during the galaxy-spanning Clone Wars.[2] She was married to the Abyssin Jackar Bowmani.
            During the Clone Wars, Letta Turmond was the wife of Jackar Bowmani, an Abyssin who worked for the Jedi Order as a munitions expert. Around 20 BBY, Turmond started to become unimpressed with the Jedi, considering them to have become soldiers and weapons. Conspiring with a mysterious Jedi, she fed her own husband nano-droids in his food.[3][4] The explosive nano-droids transformed Bowmani into a walking bomb which effectively exploded in a hangar of the Jedi Temple. The explosion caused the deaths of six Jedi, and many Temple workers and clones, and injured many more.
            While the Jedi were investigating the attack, Turmond was protesting against the war at the entrance to the Jedi Temple. Identifying her husband in a hologram that Anakin Skywalker was showing to Cin Drallig, Turmond was brought into the Temple for questioning. Expressing concern about her husband, Letta found out that the Jedi suspected him of bombing the Temple. She denied that her husband could have been involved in the bombing and was released by the Jedi.
            However, after a deeper investigation into the bombing by Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, they discovered that Bowmani had been blown up by nano-droids in his bloodstream. Skywalker and Tano proceeded to Turmond's house to see if they could find any traces of the nano-droids. None were found on Turmond, but they were present in the food, so Skywalker and Tano decided to take Turmond back to the Temple for more questioning.
            Once outside her residence, she attempted to escape the Jedi, knocking Tano over and jumping on a passing vehicle. Hopping from vehicle to vehicle, she was pursued by Tano and Skywalker. After becoming trapped by the two Jedi in an alley and under increased suspicion due to a slip of her tongue, Turmond admitted to feeding the nano-droids to Bowmani.[3]
            She was taken into custody by the Jedi, but was later moved to a Republic military base. From prison, Turmond requested to see Tano, refusing to talk to anyone else. She explained to Tano, that it was a Jedi, dissatisfied with the war, who had given her the idea to feed Bowmani the nano-droids. This Jedi wanted to make a statement to the Republic that the Jedi should not be leading the military effort. Turmond feared that she was in danger from this Jedi and only agreed to tell Tano their name if Tano protected her. However, before she could reveal the Jedi's name, she was Force-choked by Barriss Offee. Tano attempted to save Turmond, but was unsuccessful and Turmond was killed.
            Clone Commander Fox, who had seen the exchange on the security footage and believed Tano was choking the prisoner, arrived at the scene after Turmond was killed and arrested Tano for the murder.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Letta_Turmond/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLettaTurmond</string></dict>
        <key>Siri Tachi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.169.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Siri Tachi was a female Human Jedi Master, apprentice of Adi Gallia and Master to Ferus Olin. She was a talented pilot who participated in the First Battle of Geonosis, fighting alongside Master Gallia guarding the Galactic Republic transports in space above the planet.
            She was one of Obi-Wan Kenobi's closest friends, and at one point they were romantically involved. During the Clone Wars, she met an early death on Azure while on a mission with Kenobi.
            Though two years younger than Obi-Wan Kenobi, Tachi was just as powerful in her skills with a lightsaber and the Force. As a preteen, she had a very tomboyish attitude, even while considered attractive by her male peers. As with Kenobi, Tachi had a rivalry with fellow Jedi trainee Bruck Chun.[5]
            The first time Tachi spoke to Kenobi, she had already learned of his temporary leave from the Jedi Order to help the adolescents on Melida/Daan to halt the civil war on the planet, and was angry with him, calling him an embarrassment to all potential Padawans (this was before she was chosen as a Padawan herself). Later on, however, she helped him trace Bruck Chun's connection in Xanatos' infiltration of the Jedi Temple.[5]
            A few months following the Xanatos incident, Jedi Master Adi Gallia chose Tachi to be her Padawan learner. The two accompanied Kenobi and his Master Qui-Gon Jinn on several missions to planets such as Kegan,[6] Simpla-12, and Sorrus. With Adi Gallia, Tachi helped Kenobi rescue Jinn from the Force-obsessed scientist Jenna Zan Arbor. Later, Kenobi saved her from the bounty hunter Ona Nobis. Before this mission, Tachi was a headstrong and impatient Padawan, having difficulty understanding when to refrain from a fight, but learning from Kenobi's example, she became more patient and prudent.[8]
            It was not until a few years into their friendship that Tachi and Kenobi discovered their new feelings for each other. Along with their Masters, the two were again sent on a mission together: this time to save a boy, Talesan Fry, from bounty hunters on the planet Cirrus. After crashing on the planet Quadrant Seven, the Masters sent the Padawans to hide in the nearby caves in order to protect Fry. During the time they spent in the caves, Tachi and Kenobi's bickering briefly allowed them to express their feelings for each other, but they decided to put their focus on the mission. At one point in the mission, the Padawans and Fry were on board a ship rigged to blow up if it exited hyperspace.[3]
            It was during this time of potential death that Tachi and Kenobi truly recognized their feelings, and after finding a way to land the ship safely, they confirmed that they were in love. They agreed to discuss their situation more in depth after the mission was over. After putting Fry into safe hands (following the death of his parents at the hands of the bounty hunter Magus), the two agreed to abandon their love, after a talk with Jinn and Yoda about the consequences of Jinn's love for the late Jedi Master Tahl. Tachi and Kenobi vowed never to speak of their love again. However, this decision led to the gradual drifting of their friendship.[3]
            Shortly after the Invasion of Naboo, Tachi and Adi Gallia had a major disagreement, which led to Gallia dismissing her informally as Padawan, and Tachi leaving the Jedi Order. She joined the slave trader Krayn and renamed herself Zora. Tachi remained a part of his operations as his right-hand person when she briefly encountered Kenobi and his new apprentice, Anakin Skywalker. Kenobi, like most other Jedi, had believed that Tachi was a traitor.[9]
            However, after the encounter with Zora and lashing out at her, he later searched his feelings and realized the truth that Tachi would never actually betray the Jedi. This was confirmed by the Jedi High Council, revealing that Tachi's "disagreement" with Adi Gallia and her "dismissal" from the Jedi Order were all part of an intricate plan set up by the Council to overthrow Krayn's slave operations. Soon after this revelation, Skywalker, who was captured earlier and made a slave, inadvertently disclosed the true identity of "Zora", and Krayn imprisoned her with Skywalker. Working together, the two Jedi convinced the slaves to organize a revolt. With Kenobi's help from the outside, they succeeded in destroying Krayn's operations, ending with Skywalker killing the slaver. Her undercover mission finished, Tachi was welcomed back to the Jedi Order.[9] In 28 BBY, Tachi recorded a statement to the Jedi Council defending Skywalker's actions, reminding the Council that they had sanctioned Kenobi and Skywalker's mission and their encounter had been no accident. Tachi noted that Skywalker acted with impatience during his first mission, but that more than anyone he was responsible for liberating the slaves on Nar Shaddaa. She also pondered if Skywalker had been motivated by revenge to kill Krayn, then attested that had she been in Skywalker's position, Krayn would have died by her lightsaber. With that, she was of the belief that Krayn's death was decided not by Skywalker, but by the will of the Force.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Siri_Tachi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSiriTachi</string></dict>

        <key>Bria Tharen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.171.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bria Tharen was a Human female and a commander in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the early Galactic Civil War. Born to a wealthy family on Corellia, Tharen intended to study archaeology and pursue a career as a museum curator. When she was seventeen, however, Tharen experienced the Exultation performed by a t'landa Til missionary at a religious revival. Drawn in by the Exultation's effects, Tharen sold all her jewelry and booked passage to Ylesia, where she dedicated her life to the religion's service. Tharen spent a year on Ylesia before her religion was exposed as a front for a Hutt spice/slaving operation by a young Corellian pilot named Han Solo. Solo helped Tharen to escape from Ylesia and the two fell in love. However, Tharen struggled to cope without the Exultation and decided to leave Solo to confront her addiction.
            Tharen found a new purpose in life that helped her to eventually overcome her addiction. Joining the fledgling resistance movement on Corellia, Tharen devoted herself to fighting against the Galactic Empire and bringing an end to slavery. Tharen worked on several undercover assignments and helped make contact with rebels on other worlds. After the founding of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Tharen was given command of Red Hand Squadron. She began planning a raid on Ylesia to end the slavery operation, recruiting a number of smuggler pilots to act as guides, including Han Solo, with the promise of a share of the Ylesian spice. Tharen and Solo briefly resumed their relationship, but when the Rebels betrayed the smugglers at the Battle of Ylesia, taking all of the spice, Tharen and Solo parted once more. Shortly after, Tharen led Red Hand Squadron on a mission to Toprawa to help retrieve the plans for the first Death Star. Though they were successful in transmitting the plans to a Rebel courier ship, her unit was surrounded by Imperial forces, and Tharen committed suicide rather than face capture and interrogation.
            A Human female,[1] Bria Tharen was born around 28 BBY[2] to a wealthy family from the southern continent of Corellia.[6] Her name was made up by her father, Renn Tharen, from the first syllables of her grandmothers' names, Brusela and Iaphagena.[4] She grew up on her family's estate, living with Renn, her mother Sera, and her older brother Pavik. As a young girl, Tharen enjoyed studying history, finding herself particularly fascinated by stories of the Jedi Knights, the birth of the Galactic Republic and the recent Clone Wars. She wanted to be a museum curator and spent a couple of summers working on an archaeological dig, learning to preserve ancient treasures. When she finished her undergraduate schooling at the age of seventeen, Tharen was due to study archaeology with an emphasis on ancient art[6] at the University of Coruscant.[1]
            While Renn Tharen encouraged Bria's desire to have a career, Sera was more concerned in finding her a wealthy suitor and pushed her towards a relationship with Dael Levare, a young man from one of the wealthiest families on Corellia who Bria had known since they were at school together. The two began dating and were close to becoming engaged when Tharen discovered that Levare had been unfaithful and broke off their relationship. Her mother was furious with Tharen for ruining her plans for the expected wedding and instructed her daughter to apologize to Levare and take him back. Tharen refused and, upset and angry, attended a revival being held by a t'landa Til missionary from Ylesia. The service ended with a few seconds of Exultation, a process which produced a powerful feeling of rapture in Tharen and which she believed to be a religious experience. Feeling that there was little left for her on Corellia, Tharen sold all her jewelry to buy passage to Ylesia.[6]
            Unknown to Tharen, her newfound religion was an elaborate scam orchestrated by the Hutt Besadii clan to acquire workers for their glitterstim spice processing operation. Arriving on Ylesia as a pilgrim, Tharen was forced to give up all her possessions, including her name, and became known only as Pilgrim 921. She was assigned to a communal dormitory in Colony One, the first of three colonies inhabited by Ylesia's pilgrims, and spent her days working in the processing plants, measuring and trimming the fibrous strands of raw glitterstim to ensure consistent doses of the spice for export. Glitterstim, which gave its users a temporary telepathic ability, was highly reactive to light; as a result, Tharen had to perform her work in complete darkness, only able to see through infrared goggles. Every night, Tharen would attend devotions, during which t'landa Til priests performed the Exultation, to which Tharen developed an addiction. Tharen spent almost a year working on Ylesia, during which time her poor diet caused her to become excessively thin and extended time working in darkness left her skin with a pale complexion. The dangerous work also left her with numerous scars on her fingers, wrists and forearms from the sharp threads of glitterstim, and she developed a fungal infection due to the planet's warm, moist atmosphere.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bria_Tharen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBriaTharen</string></dict>

        <key>Talia  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.174.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Talia was a female Human who served as the Queen of the planet Onderon during the years prior to and following the Jedi Civil War.
            Talia was a direct descendant of the Dark Lord Freedon Nadd. However, the death of her grandparents broke the sway of the dark side over their descendants, as evidenced by her being one of the Republic's and the Jedi's staunchest allies in the Post-Jedi Civil War era.
            Before the Mandalorian Wars, Talia made an alliance with the Republic, eventually gaining Republic citizenship for Onderon. This would later cause much suffering and conflict for her people.
            When the Mandalorians invaded the Republic, Onderon was one of the first Republic worlds to fall to them. Talia's position during this time is unclear, but her cousin, General Vaklu, led the resistance to the Mandalorians. Near the end of the war, Revan and his forces liberated Onderon, though credit for this went mainly to Vaklu in the eyes of the Onderonian people.
            When Revan led his corrupt forces in the Jedi Civil War, he left Onderon almost untouched. But the Republic still needed soldiers and supplies from Onderon during this time.
            After the Jedi Civil War, the dark days of the Dark Wars began. During the next five years, the Republic began the Telosian Restoration Project, a project to see if the Republic could heal the worlds that had been ravaged in both wars. Because Onderon was one of the few worlds in the Republic that was still intact, materials and wildlife were constantly exported to Telos IV.
            Talia, as a staunch supporter of the Republic, agreed to supply the Republic with the materials it needed. Vaklu, however, saw a chance to rise to ultimate power on Onderon by taking Talia out of the picture. He began to preach about how the Republic had brought war to Onderon, how it had taken so much and now was not able to give anything back. This won him many followers and soon, Vaklu was able to openly challenge Talia's ideas in the government. Soon, he had the military blockade the planet on the grounds that he was searching for "Republic treachery", when in reality he was trying to prevent Republic aid from reaching Talia.
            Talia's main counsel during this time was the Jedi Warrior Master Kavar, who also served as one of her strategists.
            Soon, Meetra Surik, known as the Jedi Exile came to Onderon searching for Kavar. Vaklu, who had been warned about her by his secret allies, ordered Colonel Tobin to destroy the Exile's ship. Surik escaped with her ship damaged to the moon of Dxun. There, she met the remnant of the Mandalorians rebuilding on the moon. After allying with them, she managed to land on Onderon.
            When Surik was able to meet with Kavar, Tobin attempted to kill both of them, but both managed to escape. Soon after, Vaklu met with the council of lords and stated that Talia was guilty of treason. He launched a full-scale assault on Talia's royal palace. While the majority of the military remained loyal to Talia, Vaklu had Nihilus' soldiers for reinforcements. Furthermore, the Sith used the dark side to control a number of Onderon's beasts to fight for them. It seemed that Talia was doomed.
            But Surik returned to Onderon using a Basilisk war droid. By the time Surik had reached the throne room, Vaklu's forces had breached it and Vaklu was personally dueling Talia. Talia proved to be the more skillful duelist, and Vaklu desperately ordered his men to shoot her. Surik intervened, however, and defeated Vaklu. TCaptured and at Talia's mercy, Vaklu declared that Talia's reign would not be easy, as her attachment to the Republic would destroy Onderon. He then taunted her by saying he would be free within a week by his supporters. But to Vaklu's horror, Talia intended to execute Vaklu on the spot. It was then that Surik pointed out that if Vaklu was executed, it would make him a martyr to his supporters;[1] the captive General was nonetheless sentenced to death and executed by firing squad.[2] The queen then began the process of winning back the support of her people.
            Based on Darth Traya's prediction, Talia had a long and successful reign, bringing prosperity to her beloved people and leaving behind their antagonism with the Republic for helping them win the war. Consequentially, much of Onderon's identity would be replaced culturally by that of the Republic's, as many Core Worlds did before it.
            She was voiced by Seeta Indrani.
            The fact that Oron Kira and Galia are her parents is in question, though it is the most logical explanation seeing as there isn't much proof that they were her grandparents and the fact of the timeline, since Galia and Oron were probably married in 4002 BBY or sometime shortly thereafter, it is just possible that Galia gave birth to her sometime later in life. One fact disputing this is the existence of Vaklu, as thus far, Galia is not known to have any siblings.
            Talia's accent sounds like a southeast-Asian accent, like those in or near India.
            If you fail to convince Talia, she will ultimately kill Vaklu for his treason. The player can also claim the decision is Talia's to make. She will then have Vaklu killed. This option does not shift the Exile to the dark side and gains influence with Kreia and even Mandalore if he is with Surik, despite the latter's respect for Vaklu.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Talia_(Onderon)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTalia</string></dict>

        <key>Meetra Surik</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.177.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile after the Mandalorian Wars, was a female Human Jedi Master. As a Padawan, she chose to disobey the orders of the Jedi High Council and aid the Galactic Republic in its war against the invading Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. Rising to the rank of Jedi Knight during the conflict, she served with distinction under the command of her fellow Crusaders Revan and Malak and was eventually commissioned as a General in the Republic Military. Surik played a vital role in defeating the Mandalorians during the latter stages of the conflict, but as a direct result of her controversial actions during the cataclysmic final battle, she effectively cut her connection to the Force. Afterwards, out of all those who went to war, she was the only Jedi to avoid the call of the dark side and return to the Jedi Council to be judged for her crimes. After being exiled from the Jedi Order, she wandered the periphery of known space for nearly a decade before returning to the Republic during the Dark Wars, at the height of the First Jedi Purge.
            Caught up in the schemes of various mysterious factions, she was swiftly drawn into the ongoing conflict and became instrumental in engineering the defeat of the Sith Triumvirate, ruled by Darth Nihilus, Darth Sion and Darth Traya. With her connection to the Force restored, Surik emerged victorious from her campaign against the Sith Lords, and immediately began a search for the long absent Jedi Revan. She eventually found Revan imprisoned on Dromund Kaas, the capital world of a Sith Empire, believed to have been destroyed over a thousand years prior. Surik joined Revan in his mission to kill the Sith Emperor, who had been plotting an invasion of the Republic for centuries. She, Revan and Lord Scourge joined forces in their common cause and attacked the Emperor. However, Scourge seemingly betrayed his Jedi allies and stabbed Surik from behind, killing her instantly. Her death helped Revan in delaying the Emperor and his plans.
            Surik did not become one with the Force at the time of her death; instead, her spirit stayed with Revan and helped him to endure the horrors of his imprisonment in stasis. In the following years after her physical demise, the Jedi that she trained during her travels proved essential to the process of rebuilding the Jedi Order, in the wake of its near annihilation due to the machinations of the Sith. When the Sith Emperor finally unleashed his army against the Republic three centuries later, Surik's spirit instructed Jedi Master Oteg to dispatch a team to free Revan from his prison on Taral V. After urging Revan to fulfill his objective and destroy the Emperor, Surik disappeared and presumably became one with the Force.
            As a child, Surik[2] was initially found and separated from her parents by the Jedi Order.[7] Like many pre-Jedi younglings of her day, Surik started her training as a Padawan at the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. She was taken as an informal Padawan by the Jedi Knight Kavar. After Kavar left to fight the Mandalorians in the early skirmishes, she trained under many Masters, including Vima Sunrider,[3] daughter of the famed Nomi Sunrider.[11] Master Sunrider would often caution the young Surik to be mindful of her powers, especially her aptitude for severing one's connection to the Force.[3]
            When the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders launched an invasion of the Galactic Republic, Surik had overwhelming compassion for the lives lost in the Outer Rim. Inspired by her former Master Kavar, who had fought in the early skirmishes, she soon joined the ongoing battle,[3] and became part of the Jedi Knight Revan's faction of Jedi after being personally recruited by Malak himself.[12] She left a prospective Padawan, Mical, without a Master.[7]
            Surik served as one of Revan's most trusted generals during the Mandalorian Wars.[2] She would prove her skills in battle and her knowledge of warfare in many of the war's bloodiest battles and campaigns, including the second battle of Onderon's jungle moon Dxun.[7] She also attained the rank of Jedi Knight during the war, but no knowledge is known as to how this happened.[13]
            Overseeing the final battle at the Sith planet Malachor V, she gave the order to activate the Mass Shadow Generator when it was clear that the bulk of the Republic's forces, led by Revan, would not arrive in time to engage the Mandalorian armada. She watched silently from the bridge of her command ship as the generator crushed both the Republic and Mandalorian forces caught in its destructive wake. The ensuing death and destruction, particularly that of the comrades she had led and befriended during the war caused such a substantial wound in the Force that the shock would have killed Surik had she not unconsciously, and instinctively, severed her own connection. Thereafter she was deafened to the Force's call; incapable of sensing it through the interference caused by the Force echoes of the suffering that she had inflicted and been forced to witness.[14] The only Jedi under Revan able to turn away from the dark side after Malachor V, she was also the only Jedi to willingly return to the Jedi Temple on the Galactic Capital Coruscant and face trial for her actions—and also to defend them.[7] Malak originally wanted Revan to use his assassin droid HK-47 to eliminate Surik, but Revan, who referred to her as a Jedi "who was already dead," wanted her to face the Council and show them the hypocrisy of their teachings, and so let her leave.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Meetra_Surik</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMeetraSurik</string></dict>
        <key>Lusica Stynnix</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.178.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lusica Stynnix was a human female junior officer who held the rank of Lieutenant in the First Order Navy during the galactic war between the First Order and the Resistance. A product of the First Order's militarism, Stynnix was raised since birth to become an officer in the military. By 34 ABY, she served in the operations division aboard Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship—the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy.
            Lusica Stynnix[1] lived approximately three decades after the Galactic Civil War.[2] By then the First Order had emerged from the galaxy's Unknown Regions as the Galactic Empire's successor in all but name.[3] In addition to Imperial veterans, the First Order military was composed by a new generation of officers and soldiers that sought to reclaim the Empire's legacy by destroying the New Republic. Stynnix, who was a product of the First Order's training program, was serving as a junior officer in the First Order Navy[1] by 34 ABY[2]—the year that marked the end of the cold war and the start of the First Order's galactic war against the Resistance.[4] Attached to the operations division, Stynnix held the rank of Lieutenant in the Navy[1] and was serving aboard Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship, the Supremacy during the First Order's attack on the Resistance fleet.[5]
            Lusica Stynnix was part of a generation of young military officers molded since birth in the First Order's image. Unlike the Empire's youth brigades, which were largely symbolic pledges of patriotism, the First Order's youth were put into actual military service. As a result, Stynnix developed a natural competitive streak that drove her to excel in her duties—a trait commonly found in her fellow junior officers.[1]
            Stynnix was a human female who had dark hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. By the time of the war, she was considered a sub-adult due to her young age.[1]
            As an officer in the First Order Navy, Stynnix wore a dark First Order military uniform which included a cap, black leather gloves, and two code cylinders attached to her tunic. The First Order insignia was emblazoned on Stynnix's cap; her left arm sleeve bore a rank sash that commemorated Admiral Clyss Power of the Imperial Navy. Stynnix also carried a status datapad during her service in the operations division aboard the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy.[1]
            Lusica Stynnix, portrayed by an unknown actress, first appeared in the 2017 sequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.[5] She was first identified in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lusica_Stynnix</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLusicaStynnix</string></dict>
        <key>Hidden Bek lookout</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.179.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>This female Human member of the Hidden Beks swoop gang guarded the entryway to the Beks' base of operations.
            She guarded the door of the Beks' base during the Bek–Vulkar gang war, even after the Sith Empire conquered Taris during the Jedi Civil War. When the amnesiac former Dark Lord of the Sith Revan along with Carth Onasi attempted to visit the Hidden Beks' base while searching for Jedi Knight Bastila Shan, she at first barred them passage. After Revan suggested that he help the Beks in their war, the guard admitted the pair, advising them to watch out for Zaerdra, the bodyguard of Bek leader Gadon Thek, and to not make any wrong moves.
            After Bastila was rescued at the Tarisian Season Opener, the guard warned Revan that the Black Vulkars would be looking for him so they could avenge the death of their leader, Brejik.[1]
            As a result of the gang war, she became suspicious of most strangers, and immediately thought that Revan was a Vulkar spy when he approached her, wishing to see Thek. However, she relented when Revan offered to lend his support to the Beks' cause.[1]
            The Bek lookout was first introduced in the computer and video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. If the player attempts to enter the base disguised as a Sith trooper, she will not let them in. Being a Hidden Bek, she will also help the player fight any Vulkars that come across in her line of sight.
            If the player chooses to take the dark side path throughout the game, they will accept the offer from Kandon Ark to switch allegiance to the Black Vulkars. Before the player can enter the Tarisian Season Opener for the Vulkars, the dark-side player must then kill Thek. After leaving the Bek base, the lookout will then attack the player.
            Dummied content in the game reveals that she has a line where she recognizes the player as the winner of the swoop race, and if they raced for the Vulkars, she would declare intent of revenge and then attack; obviously, this is inaccessible in the base game, as she will attack immediately upon leaving the base.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hidden_Bek_lookout</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemHiddenBeklookout</string></dict>

She was kidnapped and long raised by the Mandalorians on Dantooine, and knew only an odd version of Mando'a, the Mandalorian language, and Galactic Basic Standard. She finally managed to escape them, and hid in the cargo bay of the Ebon Hawk, which had landed at the Jedi Enclave.
            While at the Enclave, Revan met Lur Arka Sulas, who was searching for the girl on behalf of her parents. Revan found the little stowaway and mastered enough of her strange language to persuade her to go home with Lur.
            The quest of Sasha includes understanding Sasha's strange version of the Mandalorian language and using it to communicate with her. The dialect that Revan learns from Sasha is unrelated to the one created by Karen Traviss. There is a glitch involving Sasha in KOTOR which allows the player to get unlimited dark side points. The player must simply tell Sasha to leave, then talk to her before she does and again tell her to leave. This gives the player more dark side points than would normally be given without exploiting this glitch.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sasha_ot_Sulem</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSashaotSulem</string></dict>

Her tactics in enforcing the will of the Emperor, Sheev Palpatine, were seen as brutal by citizens on Castell, earning her a deadly reputation.
            Ssaria was a female human who served in the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. She rose to the rank of Moff and ruled as Governor of Castell and its surrounding sector. She brutally enforced the will of the Emperor, Sheev Palpatine, and her tactics garnered her a reputation amongst the people of Castell. Some citizens took to calling her such nicknames as "the Fiend of Castell" and "the Burning Moff."[1]
            At some point after the Battle of Yavin, Ssaria had an intimate relationship with Lando Calrissian. In her residence on Castell with Calrissian one day, he began admiring a small trinket, prompting her to inquire what he found so fascinating about it. Calrissian confessed he had planned to steal it, as a means of repaying his debts. Ssaria pulled out a blaster pistol on him, as Calrissian continued on about how he couldn't steal it, knowing Ssaria would have troopers searching for him and that word of her lover's betrayal would get out. Calrissian convinced her to allow him to leave with the trinket, which he returned to Papa Toren shortly afterwards in an effort to repay his debt.[1]
            Ssaria was loyal to the Emperor and his rule over the galaxy, viewing herself as a tool to be wielded in order to carry out his will. Though her tactics were seen as brutal by people on Castell, she did not care about the reputation she gained as a result.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ssaria</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSsaria</string></dict>
        <key>Sana Starros</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.183.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sana Starros was a human female who lived during the time of the Galactic Civil War. She claimed to be married to Han Solo, though he denied it, and regardless they were not on good terms in the time after the Battle of Yavin. She traveled across the galaxy in search of Han, from Tatooine to the Monsua Nebula, in order to confront him. She was also captain of the Volt Cobra.
            Sana Starros was a human female[2] who was born on the Smugglers moon Nar Shaddaa and grew up in Wormstew Town.[1] She claimed to have married the smuggler Han Solo, though he denied she was his wife. The marriage was part of her and Solo's scam in order to pull off a robbery. However, Solo made off with her cut of the robbery.[6] At some point, she came to believe that lying was the only thing that Solo was good for, while Solo saw her as someone dangerous to him, and tried to avoid her.[2]
            Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, when Solo joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic,[7] Sana set out to find him.[2]
            Sana's search for Solo led her to the desert world of Tatooine, where Solo and his ship, the Millennium Falcon, had been shortly before the Battle of Yavin. Starros put out the word that she was looking for someone, that person being Solo, and that she was offering a reward to whoever could help her find her supposed husband. A group of armed Rodians confronted Starros in the spaceport settlement of Mos Eisley, demanding to be given the reward money despite not being willing to help her on her mission. Starros used voice-activated smart-targeting scatterblasters from Nar Shaddaa that she had hidden under the table she was sitting at to shoot all four of the Rodians in the knees, and she threatened to shoot them in their faces if they did not provide her with information about Solo's whereabouts. The lead Rodian relented and told Starros that Solo had left Tatooine after killing Greedo, a fellow Rodian.[8]
            Soon thereafter, Starros picked up Solos location and followed him into the Moddell sector in the Outer Rim Territories. Solo, who was accompanied by Princess Leia Organa aboard the Invictus, a stolen Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, fled from pursuing TIE/ln space superiority starfighters towards a planet in the Monsua Nebula, where the TIE fighters would not pursue due to dangerous electrical storms in the atmosphere.[9] Sana arrived at the nebula and flew past the TIE fighters, the pilots of which were unwilling to pursue her or the Invictus onto the surface of the planet. Starros landed her ship near where Solo was located, and the smuggler was displeased to see her. Organa asked who she was, and she introduced herself as Solo's wife—though he denied it—and demanded to know who the princess was.[2]
            During a brief exchange, in which Starros slapped Solo for tasting like the Corellian wine that Organa had splashed in his face earlier, she revealed that the planet they were on was once a favored rendezvous point for the couple. Organa, announcing that this whole affair was none of her business, attempted to leave but after Solo called out for her to stay, Starros realized the princess' importance, citing the large bounty on her head. It was at this point that the Imperials, who had sent an Imperial-class Star Destroyer into the nebula, caught up with the fugitives. Several TIE fighters and TIE/sa bombers began a bombardment of the surface, dropping proton bombs through the electrical storms below. Realizing an opportunity, Starros ordered her associate Cobra to fire on the stolen shuttle, destroying Solo and Organa's only means of escape. She then announced her intention to turn Organa over to the Imperials and bring Solo back with her. She attempted to make contact with the Star Destroyer in orbit but was interrupted when Organa kicked Solo into her and drew a weapon of her own. However, it was too late as the TIEs were already descending on their position.[10]
            After the TIE fighters landed, the pilots got out of their craft and attempted to apprehend Organa, but she opened fire and killed two of the pilots. Solo convinced Starros not to collect Organa's bounty by explaining that he was part of the Rebel Alliance as well, and that he would likely be executed or imprisoned as well. Solo shot the last remaining TIE pilot, and the trio boarded the Volt Cobra. More TIEs appeared re-engaging the Volt Cobra, and jammed its transmissions.[11] The Volt Cobra came under attack by a Star Destroyer. Starros piloted the Volt Cobra and plotted a course before entering hyperspace.[12]
            After losing the Imperials, Starros told Solo that their marriage did happen on Stenness. Starros was told by Organa to set a course for Nar Shaddaa to rescue Luke Skywalker. Starros, not wanting to join the rebellion, refused until Organa offered to pay her for her help. However all Starros wanted was her husband, to which Organa agreed. Starros set a course of Nar Shaddaa.[12] Upon the Volt Cobra's arrival on Nar Shaddaa,[13] Starros went with Solo and Organa. Along with Chewbacca, Starros helped them infiltrate the Palace of Grakkus the Hutt. However, when they got to the Palace's arena, all their blasters did not work and Starros was buried under rock. She was freed by Organa and revealed that she was not actually Solo's wife. Starros told her of the robbery in which she and Solo pretended to be married. Starros agreed to just be paid as long as Solo was not killed before that time. Starros later left Nar Shaddaa aboard the Volt Cobra alongside the Millennium Falcon.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sana_Starros</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSanaStarros</string></dict>
        <key>Olee Starstone</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.184.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Olee Starstone was a female Human Padawan who was trained by the Jedi librarian Jocasta Nu and later Jedi Master Bol Chatak during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. She bore a blue lightsaber and was physically fit, but her best skills were as a researcher and historian, like her original Master.
            Olee Starstone was accepted into the Jedi Order and grew up in the Jedi Temple, where she was selected as a Padawan of the Chief Librarian, Jocasta Nu. Starstone hoped to one day succeed Nu in her position amongst the Jedi Archives. Shortly before the First Battle of Geonosis, in 22 BBY, in an attempt to broaden her horizons, Starstone went on a mission to Eriadu. It was there that she first met Master Bol Chatak.
            In 21 BBY, at the behest of the Jedi Council, Starstone was reassigned to Chatak, becoming her Padawan. The Council felt that athletic, skilled young Jedi were needed more on the battlefield of the Clone Wars than at the Jedi Temple.
            Two years later, in 19 BBY, Starstone and Chatak were among six Jedi who traveled to Murkhana, one of the many Outer Rim Sieges. They were joined with Jedi Master Roan Shryne, who having previously lost his former Master and two Padawans during the war, had become disillusioned and bitter, while also losing much of his connection with the Force. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Republic High Command had decided that the policy of "winning the hearts and minds of the Separatists" was the most sound plan for taking Murkhana, having given the Corporate Alliance several weeks to surrender for before launching their attack. During this time, however, the Separatists used the opportunity to seed the atmosphere of the planet with anti-laser aerosols, which were designed to scatter blaster fire.
            Eventually, the Battle of Murkhana began, with the conflict lasting over three weeks. Starstone and Chatak accompanied Shryne and Clone Commander Salvo aboard a wing of LAAT/i gunships, departing from the Star Destroyer Gallant. They assaulted a Corporate Alliance landing platform in Murkhana City, and once landing, began to fight across the city. Starstone, Chatak, and Shryne accompanied Ion Team, a clone commando unit led by Captain Climber, to the deflector shield generator that protected the landing platform. During the fight to destroy the generator, Shryne saved Climber's life by lending him his lightsaber to kill an attacking mercenary. The group was finally successful, causing the landing platform to lose its defenses.
            Without warning, Palpatine initiated Order 66 to all clone troopers across the galaxy. The other three Jedi on Murkhana were quickly ambushed and killed by Salvo and his troops, but Climber and Ion Team refused to carry out the order. Unconvinced that the Jedi had betrayed the Republic, they planned to assist in the escape of their Jedi Generals. When Salvo and his men created an ambush for the remaining Jedi, Climber decided to engage his fellow clones, creating a counter-ambush. While the commandos refused to kill their brothers, the confusion they caused was substantial, and Starstone and the others were able to flee the city.
            The Jedi then disguised themselves as mercenaries, hoping to escape the planet along with the rest of the fleeing Separatist forces. With all the droid armies of the Confederacy shut down by the new Sith apprentice, Darth Vader, the clones across the planet turned their attentions to rounding up the mercenaries instead. The Jedi allowed themselves to be captured, hoping to make their escape at a later time, and were brought to a transport that was departing for a prison on Agon Nine. At the same time, however, Vader himself arrived on the world, seeking the clones that he had heard helped Jedi escape. Starstone and the others witnessed Vader confront the commandos, accusing them of treason. Climber took responsibility for the actions of his team, and told Vader that his actions were justified, as well as calling the man a "lapdog of the Emperor". Vader was furious and ignited his lightsaber, and Ion Team drew their weapons to defend themselves. They fired on the Sith, and Vader deftly deflected the bolts back at them, killing two of the clones. Climber and his teammate, Trace, escaped to a nearby treeline, disappearing into the forest.
            Master Chatak saw an opportunity to dispose of a threat to the galaxy and a killer of Jedi, and ignited her hidden lightsaber and revealed her identity to Vader. She attacked him, and the two former allies dueled, with Chatak able to wound one of Vader's cybernetic arms. Ultimately, however, Vader was too powerful for her, and he decapitated Chatak. Upon Chatak's death, Vader took to scanning the crowd of prisoners, drawing his gaze on Starstone, but he was mercifully distracted before being able to confront her. Shryne subsequently managed to use a mind trick to allow Starstone and he to escape from the prison transport, and once more attempt to flee the city. It was not long, however, until Commander Appo discovered that two prisoners were missing from their initial count, and the clone deduced that these two were in fact the missing Jedi.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Olee_Starstone</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemOleeStarstone</string></dict>

A scholar of Jedi history, Tionne was one of the first students of Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order and was almost entirely responsible for regathering the lost knowledge of the Old Jedi Order. She was involved in many important events to face the order, including the Yuuzhan Vong War, and often acted as a protector for the generation of younger Jedi Knights.
            Eventually, Tionne found love with another of Luke Skywalker's students, Kam Solusar, whom she later married. After attaining the rank of Jedi Master, Tionne served on both the Masters' Council and the more formal Jedi High Council that succeeded it. In addition, Master Solusar acted as the head of the Ossus Jedi Academy, along with her husband.
            Tionne grew up with the Jedi lore her grandmother related to her. Eventually, Imperial stormtroopers executed Tionne's grandmother for spreading those tales of the Jedi. Tionne fled Rindao, taking her grandmother's double viol with her. She made her living by working at cantinas where she could perform her music, and she would in turn ask patrons to share any knowledge they had of the Jedi Order.[1]
            While at a spaceport on Ord Mantell, Tionne received a tip about the location of the ancient Jedi city of Exis Station. Unable to pay her informant, she told him to share the information with Luke Skywalker, who was reforming the Jedi Order and would be willing to pay for the information.[1]
            Skywalker later met up with Tionne at Exis Station, and the two made an escape from the collapsing station. Luke sensed that Tionne was not very strong in the Force, but nevertheless possessed some potential. He invited her to join his budding Jedi Academy on Yavin 4.[1]
            Despite the fact that her powers were limited, Tionne worked hard and attained the rank of Jedi Knight. She spent nearly a year searching for the spiral mist-horn and crystal-pearl that she used to construct her lightsaber.
            Tionne's role at the praxeum was that of Jedi historian, and she would often teach the trainees stories of ancient Jedi through singing while accompanying herself with her grandmother's viol. She wrote a number of original ballads, such as the Ballad of Master Vodo-Siosk Baas, the Ballad of the Jedi Mechanic, and the Ballad of Nomi Sunrider.
            In addition to teaching at the academy, Tionne undertook research trips every few months, seeking whatever knowledge she could find about the history of the Jedi. She often returned with stories, songs, Twi'lek story-chains, tapestries, and other artifacts. Tionne's methods contrasted with other Jedi, some of whom stole artifacts, believing the Order had the rightful claim to any discoveries. This brought the Order into disrepute within archaeological circles, as evidenced by the suspicion of Dr. Anki Pace and her team on Bimmiel. Tionne, however, never adopted this arrogant attitude. Indeed, one of her most valuable acquisitions was Arca Jeth's holocron, a gift from archaeologists on Arkania.
            Tionne's knowledge also extended to Sith artifacts. She researched the Leviathan on Corbos to aid the Jedi mission there, and later investigated the Hssiss on Vjun.
            During Captain Gilad Pellaeon's raid on the Yavin Academy, Tionne aided in the fighting by informing the other Jedi as to the number of enemy capital ships and their class. In addition, she monitored the Academy communication stations and was the one to discover the Imperial jamming. Tionne also aided Luke by using the Force to hurl a tree into an Imperial Flying Fortress, destroying it.
            During the New Jedi Order's conflict with the Cult of Ragnos, Tionne contributed her knowledge of Sith lore to research into the Scepter of Ragnos. She later assisted her fellow Jedi in tracking the movements of Tavion Axmis.
            In 14 ABY, During the Disciples of Ragnos Crisis, Tionne was dispatched with Streen to investigate locations, from which the Disciples may have siphoned Force energy. [6]
            Tionne learned through a holocron of a hidden planet, Yalara. She found that the ancient Jedi Master Broden Kel Verdox had installed a cloaking device to keep the planet hidden from civilization, due to the fact that the indigenous population was too primitive for contact with the wider galaxy. Jaden Korr, apprentice to Kyle Katarn, acted on this information to sabotage Imperial activities on Yalara. [6]
            While the Galactic Civil War slowed down in its later years, Tionne would also preside over the newly restored Jedi Archives on Coruscant. Here, she compiled a history of the Rebel Alliance for the records and researched the relatively low-key history of the Renegade Squadron.[7]
            In 22 ABY, Tionne acquired a Jemlaat-class yacht from a Randoni trader during one of her frequent research trips to Borgo Prime, literally for the price of a song about the first Randoni merchants and where they hid their treasures. She christened the yacht Lore Seeker and made it her personal transport. She often took young Jedi trainees with her on these trips, using it as an opportunity to provide them with practical experience.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tionne_Solusar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTionneSolusar</string></dict>
        <key>Greer Sonnel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.188.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Greer Sonnel was a human female pilot and the personal assistant of Senator Leia Organa. Sonnel was a racer who piloted a purple RZ-1 A-wing interceptor, the Ossifrage. Sonnel suffered from bloodburn, a rare affliction that ultimately ended her racing career.
            Some time later, in 28 ABY, Sonnel was chief of Senator Leia Organa's staff. She accompanied the senator on several investigations into Rinnrivin Di's crime cartel and the Amaxine warriors alongside senator Ransolm Casterfo, X-wing pilot Joph Seastriker and Korr Sella.
            Greer Sonnel was born on the planet Pamarthe, and like many people on her planet, grew up to become a starfighter pilot, participating in many races across the galaxy. At some point in her life, she partook in a race known as the Gauntlet, along with fellow Pamarthens Bors, Torret, Vee and her former partner, Karsted. The race itself was known to be very mysterious and extremely dangerous, as well as being sponsored by Han Solo himself. The race took place on a course called The Evil Eye, which required the racers to thread through ten eyes, with their overall score depending on how many. For the race, Greer piloted a modified RZ-1 A-wing interceptor known as the Ossifrage.[1]
            As the race began, Greer managed to achieve a head start, with the other racers being far behind her. As she flew, she turned on a comlink, which allowed her to communicate with her fellow racers. She eventually began speaking to a man whose voice she did not recognize; however, the two continued to converse throughout the course, with each commenting on the other's piloting skills. Suddenly, the Ossifrage began to shudder with the instrument panel bleeping and flashing. Karsted had shot at her ship, blocking its thruster. Luckily, the man she had been talking to knew a solution, telling Greer to power off the ship for ten seconds and restart with the throttle on hot and the right stabilizer maximized. To her surprise, this worked, and the ship was able to continue flying. As she reached the last stretch of the race, it was announced that in order to gain double points, two ships must pass simultaneously through the last eye. Greer and her new friend proceeded to work together on this, managing to finish and win the race. As they crossed the finish line, the man asked Greer if she knew of his name, upon which he revealed he was the legendary Han Solo, and with that he recruited her to join him on his team for the Five Sabers tournament.[1]
            Three years before the Amaxine warrior crisis, Greer was diagnosed with Bloodburn syndrome, a disease that caused severe fevers. Since there was no cure, Greer had to take Hadeira serum and to avoid stressful activities such as racing. Due to Bloodburn syndrome, Greer abandoned her racing career and instead found work as the chief of the New Republic Senator Leia Organa's staff at the senatorial complex on Hosnian Prime. Her work involved managing Senator Organa's timetable and flying the Senator's personal transport, Mirrorbright. Sonnel also helped Leia's husband Han Solo to install guns into the ship as well. During her time working for Leia, Greer befriended another senatorial staff member named Korr Sella, a teenager whom they affectionately nicknamed Korrie. Sonnel's time at the Galactic Senate coincided with rising tensions between the Populists, who favoured individual member worlds maintaining autonomy, and the Centrists, who advocated a more centralized government and powerful military.[2]
            Following a dedication ceremony to honor Leia's adoptive father Senator Bail Organa, Greer informed Leia, who was a prominent Populist, that the Centrist Senator Bevicard had invited her to a reception in Coruscant. In the presence of both Greer and Korrie, Leia explained how factional politics made it improper for her to accept the invitation. After Leia and a Centrist Senator named Ransolm Casterfo accepted a senatorial mission to investigate the Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di's cartel on Bastatha, Leia discussed her travel plans with Greer and confirmed that Casterfo would be accompanying them.[2]
            Prior to leaving on the Mirrorbright, Greer greeted the New Republic pilot Joph Seastriker, who had been assigned to escort the Mirrorbright on its journey to Bastatha. Joph took an instant liking to Greer and the two exchanged conversation before departing the New Republic senate hangar. During the journey, Greer manned the helm of the Mirrorbright. Casterfo tried to make conversation with Greer and Kor Sella but made little progress due to their philosophical differences. During the visit to Bastatha, Greer stayed aboard the ship while Leia, Casterfo, Korr, and C-3PO attended a function at a casino that was hosted by the Nikto Magistrates Tosta and Xun.[2]
            Following a political argument between Leia and Casterfo, Joph informed Greer about details of the spat including Leia calling Casterfo a "spoiled brat" for criticizing the Rebellion. Later, Leia informed Greer and the others about an upcoming meeting with several Bastathan business leaders. This business delegation turned out to be a group of gangsters sent by Rinnrivin, who kidnapped Leia and spirited her away for a secret meeting with the crime lord. Rinnrivin tried to bribe the senator into easing the Republic's restrictions on the spice trade. However, Organa was rescued by Casterfo and the two escaped Rinnrivin's headquarters. Despite Rinnrivin's escape, Leia's team discovered a trove of information in the crime lord's computers which showed that the cartel's money was being funnelled into shadow corporations in the Outer Rim Territories. Based on this information, Leia and Casterfo decided to continue their investigation into Rinnrivin's syndicate.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Greer_Sonnel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemGreerSonnel</string></dict>
        <key>Allana Solo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.189.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Allana Djo Solo was the daughter of Jedi Knight Jacen Solo and Jedi Knight Tenel Ka Chume'Ta Djo, Queen Mother of Hapes. In addition to her Force-sensitivity, she was by the blood of her father, the niece of the Jedi Master Jaina Solo and the granddaughter of the heroes of the Rebellion, Leia and Han Solo. As the Chume'da of the Hapes Consortium, Allana was expected to ascend to the Hapan throne in succession to her mother. She was purported to have died in 41 ABY during the Battle of Uroro Station, after the Moff Council sanctioned the use of a nanokiller, designed to target the royal Hapan bloodline, of which Allana was a direct matrilineal member.
            In reality, posing as the war orphan Amelia Solo, Allana was placed by Tenel Ka in the custody of her grandparents who officially adopted her, after her mother received a warning through the Force from Jacen to protect their daughter. Tenel Ka hoped that the arrangement would keep Allana safe, while allowing the child to learn the ways of the Jedi.
            Later, several individuals, including Allana's great-uncle, Luke Skywalker, received a vision similar to one that Jacen Solo had had before, in which an older Allana was a queen seated upon a throne. As the Sith wanted to conquer the galaxy for themselves, they saw the potentially enthroned Allana as a threat to their plans.
            When Jacen negotiated with Tenel Ka about borrowing a Hapan fleet to help the Killiks in their battle against the Chiss, she agreed - on the condition that he spend one night with her; they did spend the night together, resulting in Jacen impregnating Tenel Ka.[4]
            Tenel Ka carried and concealed the baby for twelve months by using the Force, and one week after Allana was born, an assassination attempt was made on her life. Due to this assassination attempt, the couple decided to keep the identity of the baby's father a secret, in order to protect her from angered Hapan nobles. Ben Skywalker, who was still joined to the Gorog nest, accidentally discovered Allana's paternity; all mention of Allana and the visit to Hapes was wiped from his mind by Jacen.[1]
            Even during the Jedi convocation at Ossus, Jacen and Tenel Ka would not reveal that Jacen was Allana's father to Han and Leia Solo, Allana's paternal grandparents. Leia surmised her son knew who the father was, but did not suspect Jacen. Luke Skywalker speculated that Tenel Ka's reluctance to talk about Allana meant that she was blemished in some way—a fate the Hapans considered to be worse than death.[5]
            During the Second Galactic Civil War, Allana and her mother were marked for death—first by Jacen Solo, as a sacrifice for his Sith training,[3] although he later chose his parents for that role instead,[6] and then by Corellian leaders, as part of a plot to remove Tenel Ka and her heir from the Hapan throne in order to let a pro-Corellian relative take control. Her paternal grandparents, still unaware of their blood ties to Allana, were propelled to act on account of their relationship with Tenel Ka.
            Allana served as the primary motivation for Jacen's extreme actions, a reason owing to his love for her, which was considerably more heartfelt than his love for any other being, including Tenel Ka. After a near-successful assassination attempt on Allana and Tenel Ka by the assassin Aurra Sing—then under the alias "Nashtah"—Tenel Ka decided to leave Allana with her father on the Anakin Solo until it was safe enough for her to return to Hapes.[3]
            However, even as a dangerous battle raged over Hapes, the Star Destroyer's security was not enough to deter Sing, who easily infiltrated the ship and defeated Allana's security droid. Only the personal intervention of her father Jacen saved the young Chume'da, as he kept the assassin from reaching Allana despite many personal injuries. When Sing was momentarily incapacitated, Allana injected her with a personal defense drug, knocking her out. She was later reunited with her mother on Hapes, although she again had to be hidden from the Skywalkers and Solos.[3]
            During a private moment, Jacen discovered he actually cared more about Allana than Tenel Ka, as he thought of his daughter's welfare on a daily basis. Shortly after becoming co-Chief of State and leaving Coruscant, Jacen visited Allana to determine if Allana and Tenel Ka were meant to be his sacrifice. He gave Allana a stuffed tauntaun, which she named "Jacen," and he left shortly thereafter, only to kill Mara Skywalker and take the name Darth Caedus.[7]
            Later after Tenel Ka turned against Caedus by withdrawing all Hapan military support from the Galactic Alliance, Caedus vowed to kill anyone, including Tenel Ka, if she stood between him and his daughter. Caedus then kidnapped Allana from Tenel Ka in an effort to blackmail her into again pledging Hapes' support to the GA. Allana was replaced by a young orphan girl, Tika, who strongly resembled Allana in her looks. Caedus told Allana that people were trying to kill her so as to prevent her from complaining about being taken away from her mother. Tenel Ka had told Allana that anyone who took care of her would first have to provide a secret phrase, that together, they made up. Caedus never provided the words, frightening her in the process. Allana woke up from unconsciousness, telling Caedus that she hated him, after she hit him with a pass out gas dart that Tenel Ka had given her; it wasn't strong enough, though.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Allana_Solo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAllanaSolo</string></dict>
        <key>Ania Solo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.190.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>After the Carreras Incident, Ania joined forces with Jao Assam to hunt down Darth Wredd. Tracking him to the dead world of Dac, Ania and Jao discovered that a Sith Lord named Darth Luft had secretly been constructing a pirate fleet, using the remains of the Mon Calamari Shipyards and a slavery operation composed of Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees. Assisted by a Triumvirate force led by Admiral Gar Stazi and Yalta Val, they succeeded in saving the slaves and killing Darth Luft. However, their hunt for Wredd had been stalled as they discovered he had not been on Dac and that he had manipulated them into killing Darth Luft. Matters where complicated when Ania's past caught up with her. Framed for the murder of an Imperial Knight named Teemen Alton, she was kidnapped by her former lover Ramid who wanted to collect the bounty on her head as revenge for her abandonment of him in the past. They were forced to work together when a mysterious bounty hunter shot them down and became determined to capture Ania. The true murderer of the Imperial Knight and a former guard at the prison camp where Ania had been imprisoned during the war, the bounty hunter killed Ramid and tried to frame Ania for Alton's murder. However, Jao saved her and they were quickly retrieved by a squad of Trandoshan stormtroopers, who arrested Ania. Put on trial for her alleged crime, Ania's innocence was eventually proved by Master Val and Jao who produced evidence clearing her.
            However, Jao was arrested for his desertion from the Imperial Knights and sentenced for execution. Before the sentence could be carried out, Jao was broken out by Darth Wredd. With the consent of Empress Fel, Ania, her companions and a force of Trandoshan stormtroopers were secretly sent to recover Jao. Using coordinates sent by the latter, Ania and her team tracked them to the floating dead world of Mala, the location of the Carreras Incident. After rescuing Jao, ships carrying infiltrated members of the One Sith arrived as did Empress Fel and a fleet of stormtroopers and Imperial Knights. A great battle ensued on Mala between the Sith and the Knights during which Ania and her companions temporarily joined forces with Darth Wredd, who had orchestrated the whole confrontation to destroy the Sith. Once the battle was done, Wredd turned on them and tried to kill Empress Fel, badly wounding her. After a brief confrontation with Jao during which the Imperial Knight refused to kill the rogue Sith, Ania killed Wredd with a blaster rifle. Following the defeat of the Sith, Ania refused the empress's offer to become the captain of her personal guard and instead chose to continue her travels through the galaxy with her companions and a pardoned Jao.
            A Human female descendant of Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo,[2] Ania Solo lived through the Second Imperial Civil War of 130–138 ABY, in which the Galactic Empire under the Sith Lord Darth Krayt was defeated by the Alliance of the Empire-in-exile, the New Jedi Order, and the Galactic Alliance Remnant. Early in her life, some people believed that Solo would come to a bad end, while others believed that she had a great destiny ahead of her; Solo, on the other hand, did not believe in destiny.[1] At some point prior to 138 ABY, she developed a romantic relationship with a spacer named Ramid.[3]
            Towards the end of the Second Imperial Civil War, Ania Solo was sent to an Imperial prison camp on Drash-So in the Selvatas system for murdering an unidentified individual.[4] Her love interest Ramid also ended up in the prison camp.[5] During her imprisonment, Ania was regularly abused and tortured by a sadistic female guard, who had a prosthetic left hand and wielded a lightwhip.[4] Ania and Ramid attempted to escape the prison camp but caught the attention of the guards. During the escape, Ramid was shot and recaptured but Ania managed to escape. Ramid was severely punished for the escape attempt and developed a grudge towards Ania, whom he unfairly blamed for abandoning him. While Ania regretted abandoning Ramid, she had no way of ascertaining that he had survived.[5]
            Following her escape from the Imperial prison camp, Ania Solo encountered the kindly assassin droid AG-37. While Ania had pulled a gun on AG-37 during their first encounter, the two would become close and loyal friends. Several decades earlier, AG-37 had made an unspecified promise to Ania's ancestor Han Solo. AG-37 recognized Ania as a descendant of Solo and took pity on her. Seeing that she had no money to buy a transport out of the Selvatas system, AG-37 granted lodging and passage to Ania Solo.[5] Seeking to escape the troubles in the Selvatas system, Ania fled to the remote Carreras system, a star system near the Surd Nebula in the Outer Rim Territories.[6]
            While visiting Carreras Minor, Ania encountered a homeless Mon Calamari engineer named Sauk, who had lost his family during the One Sith's genocide against the Mon Calamari. Taking pity on a total stranger, she helped Sauk secure lodging and a meal. As a result, Sauk came to respect Ania for helping him in his hour of need and the two became close friends.[7] By 138 ABY, Ania Solo had succeeded in establishing a junkyard on Carreras Major.[6] An insectoid individual named Tham and its Human partner delivered a shipment to her, and Tham became agitated when Solo refused to pay their price of ten thousand credits. The Human attempted to threaten her, but Solo summoned a large droid which she ordered to escort Tham and the man back to their starship.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ania_Solo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAniaSolo</string></dict>

        <key>Rae Sloane</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.193.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rae Sloane was a human female dedicated to serving the Galactic Empire as a naval officer. She was instrumental in its survival in the aftermath of the Battle of Endor. While an Imperial cadet at the Defiance Flight Training Institute, she foiled a plot by Commandant Pell Baylo to assassinate Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. Sloane went on to rise through the ranks of the Imperial Navy.
            Despite only filling in for the actual captain, Yale Karlsen, who was on assignment to a construction committee, she was proud to have achieved captaincy of a capital ship by the age of thirty, an Imperial Star Destroyer called the Ultimatum. She was charged with escorting Count Denetrius Vidian to the planet Gorse and was subsequently drawn into the Gorse conflict. During her tour of the Gorse system, Sloane foiled a plot by Vidian to destroy Gorse's moon Cynda and its thorilide reserves in order to enrich himself. Due to her efforts in saving Cynda and its thorilide reserves, Captain Sloane was given permanent command of the Ultimatum.
            Later, Sloane tried to capture the rebel Kanan Jarrus by using his old friend Morfizo to lure him into a trap but failed. During the Battle of Endor, Rae Sloane served as a Vice Admiral in the Imperial Navy and commanded the Star Destroyer Vigilance. Following the Empire's defeat at Endor, she organized a secret Imperial meeting on the planet Akiva. After the New Republic liberated Akiva, Sloane fled offworld. In the following months, Sloane attained the distinguished rank of Grand Admiral, bestowed unto her by the mysterious Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax. While Sloane served as the public face of the Empire, Rax ruled from behind the scenes.
            At the instigation of Rax, Sloane initiated faux peace talks with the New Republic. While visiting the New Republic capital of Chandrila, Sloane turned against Rax after learning that his attack on Chandrila involved using mind-controlled former prisoners from Ashmead's Lock to assassinate New Republic officials. When Sloane objected to Rax's methods, her attache Adea Rite tried to assassinate her. After escaping Chandrila, Sloane joined forces with the former rebel Brentin Lore Wexley to hunt down and kill Rax. With the help of Brentin and the New Republic operative Norra Wexley, Sloane managed to stop Rax from destroying Jakku along with the Imperial and New Republic fleets. After executing Rax, she fled into the Unknown Regions with Brendol Hux, his son Armitage Hux, and several child soldiers. Whilst in the Unknown Regions, the remnants of the Empire eventually reformed into the First Order with Sloane as one of its initial leaders.
            A human female, Rae Sloane was born on the Core planet Ganthel nineteen years prior to the galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars.[1] Her family was not wealthy and the young Sloane longed to live in a richer and greener world. One night while her parents slept, Sloane ran away from her home and made her way to the nearest ship dock with the hope of sneaking aboard a freighter and traveling across the galaxy. Sloane managed to make her way to the ship dock and hide between two crates of kelerium. At that point, Sloane experienced "cold feet" and decided to return home.[5]
            However, Sloane encountered four members of a local criminal gang called the Kotaska, who dealt in spice and slaves. They trapped her and attempted to abduct her. Fortunately for Sloane, a passing astromech droid saw the commotion and set himself off as an alarm. A nearby dock constable managed to chase off the Kotaska and Sloane took the opportunity to flee home. Sloane never told her parents about the incident but never gave up her desire to leave Ganthel. When the Galactic Empire cleared out the Kotaska and other criminal groups on her world, this convinced Sloane that it was a force for good and order in the galaxy.[5] In order to avoid being employed at a shipyard or loading dock, Sloane left Ganthel and enrolled in the Empire's[1] naval academy[7] on Prefsbelt.[8]
            During her time at the Prefsbelt Academy, Sloane partook in the Naval Corps Boxing. Despite never winning "the belt," she nevertheless was skilled at it, and always ranked.[5] Sloane graduated high in her class at Prefsbelt, and ended up studying navigation as a Lieutenant on board the Defiance Flight Training Institute,[8] a facility run by Commandant Pell Baylo based on board the Defiance cruiser. During her time on the starship, Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine was invited by Baylo to hold meeting with several chiefs of the Imperial Navy which aimed to decide how the military schools the Empire had inherited from the Galactic Republic could be incorporated into the Imperial academies. The Emperor, and his apprentice Darth Vader boarded the Defiance in the Denon system where Baylo started running Sloane and the other cadets through drills and simulations on the ships bridge for the Emperor and Vader. Palpatine remained only a short time but ordered Vader to stay and observe, which he did for several hours as Baylo constantly berated his cadets as they worked.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rae_Sloane</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRaeSloane</string></dict>
        <key>Jaina Solo Fel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.194.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jaina Solo Fel was a Human female Jedi Master of the New Jedi Order, member of the Jedi High Council, the wife of Jagged Fel, the twin sister of Jacen Solo, and the older sister of Anakin Solo. Born to Han and Leia Organa Solo, she inherited her father's mechanical aptitude and her mother's Force sensitivity, resulting in her eventual training at the Jedi Praxeum. During her time there as a youth, she had many adventures, including helping to thwart the Second Imperium, where she helped Zekk abandon the dark side of the Force and join the ranks of the Jedi.
            When the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, Solo joined the New Republic military and distinguished herself as a Rogue Squadron pilot. She was constantly on the front lines of battle during the Yuuzhan Vong War, earning the title of Sword of the Jedi from her uncle, Luke Skywalker, and becoming known as an avatar of the Trickster Goddess Yun-Harla to the Yuuzhan Vong. During the war, she also became romantically involved with fellow pilot Jagged Fel. However, the death of her brother Anakin caused Solo to walk dangerously close to the dark side. She was later redeemed with the aid of Kyp Durron. As the war waged on, Solo discovered a way for the reformed Galactic Alliance to use Yuuzhan Vong warships and biots to their advantage, and also personally slew Warmaster Tsavong Lah in the Battle of Ebaq. Solo fought in many of the war's battles, ultimately participating in its conclusion. Solo, as a survivor of the Mission to Myrkr, later became Joined into the Killik community, and was involved in the subsequent Dark Nest Crisis and Swarm War on the side of the Killiks against the Chiss, which strained her relationship with Jagged Fel.
            In 40 ABY, she assumed control of Hardpoint Squadron and participated in the Battle of Tralus, siding with the Galactic Alliance. Afterward, she and her brother Jacen commanded Rogue Squadron during the Blockade of Corellia. The resulting crisis resulted in a split between her and Jacen due to his increasingly aggressive actions, though she remained active in the Jedi Order. Solo would later be paired up with Jagged Fel and Zekk on a mission to hunt down the renegade Dark Jedi Alema Rar. The death of her aunt Mara Jade Skywalker and the dark deeds of her brother only encouraged her to find a way to stop Jacen, who had fallen to the dark side and she began seeking the means to do so through training with her father's ex-arch-enemy, Mandalore Boba Fett. She later killed her twin brother, now the Sith Lord Darth Caedus, in a lightsaber duel aboard the Star Destroyer Anakin Solo.
            Following her brother's death, Solo remained an active member of the Order. As such, when Chief of State Natasi Daala exiled her uncle, Luke Skywalker, from the New Jedi Order as the beginning of a bid to take control of the Jedi, Solo created a covert group, Darkmeld, as a means of secretly undermining Daala's efforts. Daala's increasing extremism prompted the Order to lead a coup to remove Daala from power. Following that, Solo joined her uncle in fighting against both an emerging Sith threat and a dark side entity known as Abeloth. When the Sith and Abeloth took control of the government on Coruscant, Solo joined her uncle and many of the other Jedi in an infiltration and surprise assault on the occupiers. Solo was confirmed as a Jedi Master by her uncle during this struggle. Following the destruction of Abeloth and the end of the Sith threat, Jaina Solo married the Imperial Jagged Fel, whom she had reconnected with during the Second Galactic Civil War.
            Even before they were born, Solo and her twin brother Jacen, along with their mother, were subject to three kidnapping attempts by Grand Admiral Thrawn's Noghri Death Commandos. In order to entice the mad Dark Jedi Joruus C'baoth into helping him with his campaign, Thrawn had made a promise to apprehend Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa Solo, and her as yet unborn children—Force-sensitive individuals that C'baoth could then corrupt and mold in any way that he saw fit once he got his hands on them.[3]
            After a visit to the blighted world of Honoghr and securing the allegiance of the Noghri, Leia ensured that Solo and her twin brother were born on Coruscant during the final days of the Thrawn campaign without the threat of any more kidnapping attempts by Noghri Death Commandos hanging over their heads. Thrawn, however, still trying to keep his end of the bargain, sent Imperial Intelligence agents to Coruscant to kidnap the twins and their mother once again. The quarters in which the Solo family lived were destroyed, but Thrawn's agents once again were foiled and the twins were unharmed.[3]
            Despite the reassurances of ancient Jedi lore that held that childish innocence was an effective obstacle to the corrupting influence of the dark side of the Force, Solo's uncle Luke Skywalker believed that any contact with the dark side could warp the mind of a young child for the rest of his or her life. Given the Force potential in the twins, Luke told Solo's parents that he felt it was best to minimize any chance for the twins to be exposed to the dark side during this vulnerable time.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Solo_Fel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJainaSoloFel</string></dict>

During an attack on an Imperial patrol in the city streets by the insurgents, Siliu was separated from her mother and began crying out for her in fear. The Alliance to Restore the Republic agent Jyn Erso spotted the child crying in the chaos and ran to her from cover, holding her and shielding her from the fighting until her mother spotted the two of them and rushed over to drag Siliu away to safety.

        <key>Silara Panteer</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.199.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Silara Panteer was a female Human from the planet Alderaan and a member of the noble House Panteer who served as the Queen of her homeworld for several decades during the Great Galactic War and Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. However, her son Gaul Panteer withdrew the planet from the Republic in his capacity as Senator in protest of the Treaty of Coruscant that ended the Great Galactic War in 3653 BBY, and Silara was killed a few years later in a shuttle crash, shortly after her son was murdered by assassins. The Queen's death led to the Alderaan Civil War, as Houses Ulgo, Organa, Thul, and Panteer fought to claim Alderaan's throne.
            A Human[5] female,[1] Silara Panteer[8] was a member of House Panteer, a noble family and one of the Great Houses on the planet of Alderaan.[7] Panteer became Queen of her homeworld sometime before 3667 BBY,[2] continuing decades of Panteer rule before her,[3] and she also bore a son named Gaul.[1] During her reign, Queen Panteer was beloved by the Alderaanian populace, and even her adversaries greatly respected the monarch and her undisputed rule.[7] In 3667 BBY, during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, Alderaan was invaded by the Empire, and during the invasion Imperial forces under the command of the Sith Lord Darth Malgus razed Castle Panteer and captured the royal family. However, the Queen and her family were later rescued by the Republic and Jedi forces who succeeded in repelling the Imperials.[2]
            By 3653 BBY, the Queen's son Gaul had become Alderaan's Senator in the Galactic Senate. That year, Alderaan hosted peace talks between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, but when the Empire attacked the Republic capital of Coruscant, the Republic was forced to sign the Treaty of Coruscant that ended the war. An enraged Gaul Panteer declared Alderaan's independence and stormed out of the Senate Building in disgust, returning to his homeworld. Queen Panteer also became ill around this time, and her health steadily worsened over the next few years as Gaul entered into secret negotiations to return Alderaan to the Republic. However, Gaul was murdered[9] by assassins of House Rist on the orders of House Ulgo,[10] and Queen Silara's shuttle crashed only days later[9] in the Glarus Valley after being sabotaged, leading to her death.[4]
            The Queen's body was recovered from the river, but she had not been wearing the royal crown, which sank to the bottom of the river in its duralloy container.[4] In the weeks that followed, tensions soon broke out into open war as Bouris Ulgo declared himself king, and a four-way war between the Republic-backed House Organa, the Empire-backed House Thul, House Ulgo, and House Panteer erupted as the Alderaan Civil War began.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Silara_Panteer</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSilaraPanteer</string></dict>

Uddra was a native of Sixmoon in the Velusia system, and during her service at an Imperial Academy, she handpicked Velus for training as a loyalty officer due to his high level of intelligence and aggressive demeanor. Velus was transferred to the ISB's training program at the Viper's Nest on the ocean world of Virkoi. Under Uddra's tutelage, Velus underwent a harsh and violent training program which involved frequent physical combat and stimulated torture sessions. On one occasion, Uddra even broke his toes in order to toughen him up.[1]
            Velus' first assignment as a loyalty officer was to interrogate the Imperial Navy Lieutenant Alster Grove, who was part of a cabal seeking to overthrow Emperor Palpatine by assassinating Darth Vader. Uddra assigned him with rooting out the names of the other conspirators. Under Uddra's direction, Velus tortured Grove for two nights until the man yielded the names of his fellow conspirators.

        <key>Seelah Korsin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.202.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Seelah Korsin was a Human female healer and miner who eventually rose to become one of the foremost leaders of the planet Kesh's Lost Tribe of Sith. Born a slave to Sith Lord Ludo Kressh on the planet Rhelg, Seelah escaped a life of servitude after the execution of her family. She fell in with a young Sith mineralogical corps member named Devore Korsin, whom she married—together they had a son, Jariad. In 5000 BBY, the new Seelah Korsin joined her husband's mining crew on a mission to obtain valuable Lignan from the planet Phaegon III's largest moon, only for their ship, the Omen, to get knocked off-course as it jumped to hyperspace during a Jedi attack. The Omen violently crash-landed on the remote world of Kesh—Korsin survived the disaster along with Devore, Jariad, and her brother-in-law, Omen captain Yaru Korsin. The survivors made camp in the mountains, where after an attempt to usurp control of the group, Devore was killed in single combat by his brother Yaru. Aggrieved by her loss, Korsin dedicated the rest of her life to avenging the death of her husband. After several nights stranded in the mountains, the Sith made their way to local civilization, where they posed as the native Keshiri gods and took their place as rulers of the world.
            Although determined to kill him, Korsin married Yaru Korsin in the coming years in order to secure the statuses of both herself and her young son in the new Sith organization known as the Lost Tribe—as part of the ploy, Korsin had a daughter, named Nida, with her sworn enemy. Korsin used her past experience as a battlefield medic and her skill with the Force to lead the Sith sick wards, pursuing a dream of physical perfection for all future members of the Lost Tribe. To that end, in 4985 BBY Korsin engineered the purge of the entire contingent of Pureblood Sith on Kesh, framing their leader Ravilan Wroth for the deaths of thousands of Keshiri, then convincing Yaru that the Purebloods posed a threat and needed to be eliminated. As Jariad grew older, Korsin set him up to succeed Yaru as Grand Lord of the Lost Tribe. Finally, in 4975 BBY, Korsin decided that it was time to strike. Along with Jariad and a group of Sith Saber warriors, Korsin ambushed Yaru in their mountain temple. However, the surprise entry of Nida and her Skyborn Rangers turned the tide, and though Yaru died in the battle, Jariad was killed along with the rest of Korsin's force. Korsin was gravely wounded when Yaru's Houk friend Gloyd detonated a proton detonator that brought down the room in which she was located, and subsequently lost the use of her legs. In accordance with Yaru's wishes, the new Grand Lord Nida Korsin ordered the withdrawal of the Lost Tribe from the temple, leaving Korsin to live out the rest of her days there alone.
            Born a descendant of Tapani refugees, the Human female known as Seelah grew up on the planet Rhelg of the remote Sith Empire in the era before the Great Hyperspace War. In her youth, Seelah was a slave to the Sith Lord Ludo Kressh, who maintained his lordship on Rhelg. Seelah discovered her Force-sensitivity at a young age, using the Force along with natural talent to become a skilled healer by the age of thirteen. Her ability was noticed by Kressh, and she was soon charged with the care of the Sith Lord's feet, an immensely proud moment for her family. However, unlike her kin, Seelah was not content to be a slave and began to question her lot in life. She was inspired by the ambition of Kressh's nemesis Naga Sadow, and in Kressh's entourage met many people of high status, including a prominent Sith naval captain named Eldrak Korsin. Kressh's rivalry with Sadow, and his aversion to Sadow's desire to stretch the Empire's boundaries, sometimes caused the Sith Lord to fly into drunken rages, and Seelah found herself the recipient of beatings on at least one occasion. Shortly before 5000 BBY, Kressh wounded his ankle in a battle, and Seelah failed to effectively treat the infection. As punishment, Kressh killed her entire family, driving Seelah to escape. She found her chance when one of Sadow's mining teams stopped on Rhelg to refuel and finally left life under Kressh. She connected with a young man in the Sith mineralogical corps named Devore Korsin, the son of the naval captain whom she had met years before. She soon married him, becoming Seelah Korsin, and had a son, Jariad. She secured a place on his mining crew and set to work at his side.[1]
            In 5000 BBY, Korsin, along with an infant Jariad, accompanied Devore on the Sith invasion fleet's[3] Sith dreadnaught[4] Omen, serving as a mining operative—the Omen had been sent on a mission to mine valuable Lignan crystals from the planet Phaegon III's largest moon, an endeavor taking place at the height of the Great Hyperspace War between the Sith and the Galactic Republic. However, the endeavor ended in disaster. A Jedi attack caused the Omen's sister ship, the Harbinger, to bump into the Omen as it jumped to hyperspace. Pushed off-course, the Omen was severely damaged by a gravity well before dropping back into realspace in front of a mysterious world called Kesh. In the immediate aftermath, Devore sent Korsin to save herself and Jariad by escaping the vessel in one of the escape pods. However, as Korsin would soon find out, the pods were inaccessible and non-functioning. Instead, Korsin made her way to the bridge, finding it in chaos as the ever-ambitious Devore struggled with his half-brother, Omen captain Yaru Korsin, over the ship's controls. Along the way, she stopped by the cargo bay, where through the hold's angled viewports she spotted land on the strange world toward which the Omen was headed. Carrying Jariad in her arms, Korsin arrived at the bridge unhurt, but severely shaken. While Devore and Yaru continued to quarrel, Korsin notified them of her discovery of land.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Seelah_Korsin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSeelahKorsin</string></dict>

        <key>Cerasi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.206.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cerasi was a Human female who was one of the leaders of the Young, a youth organization that brought a halt to the civil war between the Melida and the Daan on the planet Melida/Daan. Her father was Wehutti, a Melida leader. She also had a brother, who was sent to work in a munitions factory and whom she had not heard from since.
            During the civil war, Cerasi met a Daan youth, Nield, and together, the two decided to unite the Daan and the Melida orphans. They created an organization which would fight for peace, and were known as the Young. During the war, the group helped the Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to rescue their fellow Jedi, Tahl. Later, Kenobi chose to stay and fight with the Young. Cerasi became very close friends with Kenobi during his stay on Melida/Daan; Kenobi would later say to Bant Eerin that he had loved her.
            Under Nield and Cerasi's leadership, the group won the war and formed a government. Nield was elected as Melida/Daan's Governor, and established a new history squad that began to tear-down the Halls of Evidence. Cerasi and Kenobi began to doubt the wisdom of destroying Melida/Daan's history, and moved to stop the destruction. Nield felt they had turned against him. The tension came to a peak when the elders and Nield's followers, both armed, converged on the halls of evidence. Kenobi and Cerasi arrived to try and stop the violence, but Cerasi, who was unarmed, was shot and killed by one of Mawat's sharpshooters positioned on a nearby roof.
            When Deila, Obi-Wan, Cerasi and another Young warrior went to round up Wehutti (who was in fact Cerasi's father) and some Elders who wouldn't give away their weapons, Cerasi was told to wait outside. Deila, who was the Young's bomb expert, blasted away the door and the Young surged in, evenly matched with the Elders. Fortunately Cerasi had climbed up the side of the house and ambushed them from behind, earning the Young a victory.
            Both Nield and Obi-Wan Kenobi were deeply disturbed by Cerasi's death. Soon after, Qui-Gon Jinn returned to Melida/Daan and together with Kenobi, they investigated Cerasi's murder. The duo discovered that a member of the Young, named Mawat, had armed both sides, and placed sharpshooters at the scene, who had killed Cerasi. When Obi-Wan informed Nield of this, they left to try and stop the war being waged in Cerasi's name, although they were unable to halt the violence. Qui-Gon subsequently arrived and produced a hologram of Cerasi speaking of peace. Cerasi had made the recording on her datapad shortly before her death. Qui-Gon was able to negotiate a cease-fire, and Nield was made one of the three planetary leaders.
            Cerasi was named after former LucasBooks editor Chris Cerasi.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cerasi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemCerasi</string></dict>
        <key>Serra</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.207.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Serra was a Force-sensitive female Human born from Ambria who was the daughter of the healer Caleb. After attempting to kill the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Bane to avenge her father's death, she was killed by Darth Cognus.
            In 1000 BBY, Darth Bane came to Caleb, poisoned by synox, and looking for someone to cure him. Caleb initially refused to heal him, but when Bane threatened his daughter's life, using the Force to levitate her over a boiling pot, he relented and healed the Sith Lord.
            In 992 BBY, Caleb forced his sixteen-year-old daughter to change her name and move to a different planet so that she could not be threatened by Bane again.
            When Bane's apprentice, Darth Zannah, came to Caleb to save her Master's life in 990 BBY after a duel on Tython, Caleb informed Zannah that his daughter had moved away, and that she could not use her as leverage against him as Bane had done previously. Zannah still managed to strike a deal with Caleb to heal Bane, before killing the healer and evading the team of Jedi that came looking for them.
            After leaving Ambria, Caleb's daughter took the name of Serra and began using her healing abilities around the galaxy. After saving Lucia's life, the former member of the Gloom Walkers became Serra's bodyguard. Serra later met Prince Gerran of the Doan Royal House, who suffered from an illness. Serra tended him and healed him. Over time, the two fell in love and Gerran proposed to Serra. She accepted, despite the fact that Gerran's father opposed this union. She therefore became the Princess of Doan.
            During the time following the New Sith Wars, the Doan Royal House came into conflict with the planet's mining caste. In 980 BBY, Gerran was accidentally killed by the miners, an event which sent Serra into a deep depression. Hoping to alleviate Serra's pain, Lucia arranged for the assassination of a mining caste leader, Gelba; however, a Jedi Knight, Medd Tandar, was also killed in the attack. Serra traveled to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to reassure the Jedi that the assassination was not the fault of the Doan Royal House. While in the Jedi Temple, Master Obba showed Serra a monument which honored the five Jedi who died at Tython, as well as Caleb. Shocked to find that her father had died, Serra swore vengeance and hired the same assassin that Lucia had hired to kill Gelba—known as the Huntress—to capture Bane, whom she believed had killed her father, thus taking her first step toward the dark side.
            Darth Bane was captured by the Huntress and about twenty mercenaries provided by Serra. Bane was then brought to the Stone Prison on Doan, where Serra, now steeped in the Dark Side, tortured and interrogated him, keeping him drugged so he couldn't escape, only to find that he denied having killed her father. Lucia, shocked by the vengeful person Serra had become—and remembering the many times that Bane had saved her life as a member of the Gloom Walkers—decided to free Bane. Meanwhile, Zannah and her new apprentice, Set Harth, arrived on Doan to rescue Bane from Serra, since Zannah needed to personally defeat her master before becoming the next Dark Lord of the Sith. Zannah discovered that Bane had been freed and attacked him in the Prison. Serra, hoping to kill the two Sith, activated the self-destruct sequence for the prison before fleeing with the corpse of Lucia, who had been killed by Zannah. Bane and Zannah's duel ended in a draw, and they both escaped the collapsing prison. Bane found the Huntress as he fled, and the assassin submitted herself to his teachings, taking on the name of Darth Cognus.
            Serra returned to her home on Ambria, where she realized that her father would never have wanted her to be the vengeful person she had become and let go of the Dark Side and her anger. She buried Lucia outside her father's hut. However, Bane and Cognus arrived soon after; Cognus had tracked Serra there through the Force. Serra refused Bane's proposal to serve him as a healer and she tried to convince Cognus that the dark side would destroy her. However, Cognus merely requested Bane's permission to kill Serra. Bane then ordered Cognus to bury the body, not out of any respect, but to merely keep away scavengers.
            Serra, like her father, was a good-hearted person who sought to use her healing abilities to help others and was willing to heal even Lucia after she threatened her with a blaster. She was also strong willed and was able to stand up to anyone, from Lucia and bounty hunters to Darth Bane during their last confrontation on Ambria.
            However, Serra had a dark side which stemmed from the constant threat of the "dark man" of her past. She suffered many years from nightmares of the encounter, dreams that went away when she married Gerran. However, Gerran's death brought out the dark side of her personality and she was willing to do anything for vengeance against Darth Bane.
            Only after Lucia's death did she see through her desire for revenge. The loss of the one who was like a mother to her drove her out of her fury.

        <key>Winter Celchu</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.208.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Winter Celchu, the only child of Sheltay Retrac, was raised as a sister and companion to Princess Leia Organa during the dark years of the reign of the Galactic Empire. Like her adopted sister, Winter became a pivotal player in the Galactic Civil War, serving in various roles, most notably as a spy. As an operative of Alliance Intelligence, she served the Rebel Alliance and later the New Republic. Her holographic and audiographic memory gave her a special advantage in piecing together confusing situations or even simply computing data. She was often attached to Rogue Squadron as an intelligence officer, though sometimes under false identities.
            Winter also served a vital role as Leia Organa's best friend, aide and confidante. She had special relationships with Leia's children Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo, whom she raised during their first years of life. She had a long romance with Tycho Celchu, from whom she was often separated by war, but the couple would eventually marry. She was also known to be a close personal friend of Admiral Ackbar.
            Winter was the only child of Sheltay Retrac, the senatorial aide of Bail Organa at the time of the Clone Wars, and an unknown Alderaanian artist (possibly Ob Khaddor).[6] Her parents both died when Winter was still young.
            She was adopted by Bail and Breha Organa, and became Princess Leia's best friend and companion.[7] The two grew up together on the peaceful planet of Alderaan and attended the best schools, learning about art and history, as well as ladylike graces. Possessed of a natural grace and poise, she was often mistaken for Princess Leia by visitors to Alderaan's court. This impression was increased by the fact that Leia's youthful tomboy nature did not seem as regal as Winter's stately bearing.
            Despite these differences in personality, however, Winter would remain a comfort to Leia, who had problems relating to the snobbish, cruel young girls at court. Though the pair's physical resemblance was tempered by Winter's stunning white hair, the two friends would soon learn to employ similar looks for tactical advantage, a practice they would continue throughout their lives. Winter would sometimes disguise herself as Leia so that Leia could escape the palace to create mischief and visit with inappropriate boys. It was probable that Winter attended the University of Alderaan with Leia, who recalled that Winter's perfect memory was very helpful when it came time to study for exams.[8]
            One way or another, Winter and Leia were both schooled in Alderaanian ideals of freedom and liberty, as well as weaponry, on Leia's insistence. A key tutor was Sabé, the former handmaiden of Leia's mother, Padmé Amidala.
            Also as teenagers, the young women encountered Emperor Palpatine on Imperial Center. The image of Palpatine and his eyes, which made her feel as if he would drink up her spirit, would remain with Winter forever and influence her decision to join the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[9]
            In 3 BBY, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention, Winter and Leia attended a celebration and ran into Jahan Cross. Upon seeing the two young ladies three years after leaving Alderaan, Cross made it look like he did not recognize Leia, "mistaking" Winter for the Princess on purpose.[10]
            In 3 BBY Winter participated in a Rebel Alliance meeting on Cloud City organized by Bria Tharen. Winter represented Alderaan alongside Hric Dalhney and a Caamasi named Ylenic It'kla. Winter, posing as Dalhney's daughter, served as the recorder for the Alderaanian delegation. Following Bria's initial speech to the attendees, Winter joined her for a cup of vine-coffeine. The two young women discussed their backgrounds, Corellian and Alderaanian culture, and the cruelty of slavery on Ylesia, forming a quick connection. Winter confided in Bria that she supported military action, despite Alderaan's traditional pacifism, and that she would try to convince Leia and Bail Organa of this truth. She also mentioned that she and Leia could accomplish much for the Rebellion, since both were trained with blaster and the prevailing galactic presumption that women were weak would make them appear harmless. Ultimately, the meeting on Cloud City would lead to the formation of the Corellian Treaty that officially formed the Rebel Alliance.[9]
            True to her promise to Bria, when the Rebellion began Winter was heavily involved with many of the operations, partly because she was unassuming and non-threatening, but mainly because of her holographic and audiographic memory. Since Winter perfectly remembered everything that happened to her, she was particularly suited to a career in intelligence. She participated in several Rebel undercover missions with various code names such as "Targeter."[11] Her time under the alias "Targeter" may have been cut short, however, when Imperial spies discovered and eliminated the Rebel cell on Averam she was working with.[12] As a result of her successful procurement efforts, "Targeter" gained a spot on the Imperial's "most wanted" list and was to continue to serve in this role throughout the period from the Battle of Yavin to the Battle of Endor.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Winter_Celchu</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemWinterCelchu</string></dict>
        <key>Senya Tirall</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.209.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Senya Tirall was a Human female Force-sensitive native of Zakuul, the capital of the Eternal Empire. Joining the ranks of the Knights of Zakuul, she rose to become a member of the personal guard of the Immortal Emperor Valkorion and caught his interest. The two began a romantic affair, and Tirall bore three children—the twins Thexan and Arcann, and her daughter Vaylin. Senya grew troubled by Valkorion's indifference to his children, which culminated with him locking Vaylin on Nathema and subjecting her to a mental conditioning. Senya attempted to rescue her daughter to no avail and later attempted to run away with the children, but they refused to leave, calling her weak. Senya abandoned her family, but not the Empire, taking assignments on the fringes of Zakuulan space. Seeing her family only in public broadcasts, she eventually learned that Thexan was killed during the raids into the Core Worlds. Not long afterwards, Valkorion was assassinated and Arcann claimed his Eternal Throne, launching Eternal Empire conquest of the galaxy and enacting a Scion massacre, which was the last straw for Senya and caused her to oppose the tyranny of her children.
            After the Outlander blamed for killing Valkorion was rescued from carbonite by Senya's associate Lana Beniko, she was asked to provide assistance in their escape. Senya joined Beniko's group in the Endless Swamp, where she helped raise the legendary Gravestone from the mud, escaping on the ship alongside Zakuulan defector Koth Vortena. The group traveled to the shadowport of Asylum, where Senya introduced the Outlander to the Scions of Zakuul and revealed her relationship to the Emperor and his High Justice. She later accompanied the Outlander back to Zakuul on a mission to find and recruit the Lady of Sorrows, returning with her to Asylym shorly before Arcann's Eternal Fleet launched an attack. Senya helped defend the Gravestone against skytrooper assault and engaged her daughter in a Lightsaber duel, during which Vaylin revealed to her that it was Arcann who killed Thexan. Escaping from the Eternal Fleet on the Gravestone, Senya traveled with the rest to Odessen, where she joined Lana Beniko's Alliance to oppose the Eternal Empire. Senya participated in Alliance operations on Zakuul and Vandin, providing valuable information on the Eternal Empire. She joined an assault party that boarded an Eternal Fleet warship in an attempt to control the ships' GEMINI captains, which inadvertently resulted in SCORPIO taking control of the Eternal Throne.
            In the resulting battle of Odessen Senya rescued wounded Arcann from his Eternal Flagship and fled from the Alliance forces determined to redeem him. An attempt to contact loyalist Zakuulan Knights turned disastrous when Vaylin intercepted the call and massacred the Knights on Ord Mantell, with Senya herself barely escaping her daughter. Senya later brought Arcann to Voss, where Vaylin again found her and launched an Invasion of Voss before Voss healing ritual could fully help Arcann. Desperate, Senya contacted the Alliance for help and begged the Commander to hold off Vaylin's forces and allow Arcann to be redeemed. However, there was still not enough time and Senya ordered Voss Mystics to give her strength to her son, which healed Arcann, but left Senya comatose. She remained on Odessen under watch, waking up only when Vaylin found a way to break her conditioning and launched an assault on Odessen. Senya joined her son, who had been redeemed and joined the Alliance, in defending the Gravestone from the ground assault and conronted Vaylin together with the Alliance Commader, who struck her a killing blow. To stop the rampage of the leaderless Eternal Fleet, Senya and Arcann accompanied the Alliance Commander to Zakuul, allowing them to seize the Eternal Throne and pacify the rampaging Fleet. However, Valkorion's spirit then attempted to take over the Commander's body and Senya and Arcann used Dramath's holocron to enter Commander's mind and aid them in finally destroying Valkorion, ending his millenia-long existence.
            Senya Tirall was born on a Wild Space planet of Zakuul, the capital of the Eternal Empire ruled by Immortal Emperor Valkorion. When her Force-sensitivity was discovered, she joined the rank of the Knights of Zakuul and eventually earned a place in Emperor Valkorion's elite guard. Senya didn't hesitate to speak her mind, speaking out against replacing Human soldiers in military positions with skytroopers, catching the Emperor's interest. Two years later, Valkorion and Senya become romantically involved and she eventually bore his children, giving birth to twins Arcann and Thexan. Despite Senya showering them with love, her sons gave none in return, seeking to impress their father, who seemed content to ignore them in turn. Their third child and only daughter Vaylin, was a trouble from the very start, being so powerful that she made furniture move with the Force while still in the womb. As a toddler, Vaylin tore droids apart and one time, when a guard dropped a ball she tossed, Vaylin crippled him.[3] Senya spend as much as she could with her daughter and the two shared many happy moments, but Vaylin preferred to do even mundane tasks using Telekinesis instead of her hands. Eventually during a sparring exercise Vaylin gave way to her rage, crushing several Zakuul Knights inside their own armor.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Senya_Tirall</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSenyaTirall</string></dict>
        <key>Selven</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.210.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Selven was a female Human high-profile assassin who became infamous for her extermination of the Ulgo family on Taris.
            Selven began her career as a mere killer in the employ of Davik Kang, the local crime lord of the Exchange on Taris. Eventually, she abandoned her service to him to work as a freelance assassin for the highest bidder.
            Sometime during or prior to 3956 BBY, possibly under the employ of House Organa, Selven murdered six civilians—an entire family of House Ulgo—along with all their bodyguards. This massacre was only the first of a chain of killings that would lead to the extinction of the entire house on Taris. Day after day, more and more Ulgos fell at the hands of Selven, whether gunned down on the streets, poisoned in their own homes, or a variety of other methods. In spite of the level of security stacked against her, Selven was always able to elude the authorities, proving herself unstoppable to all the guards and droids that the Ulgos could muster for their protection. By the end of her killing spree, no Ulgo remained alive on Taris, and she had earned a reputation as the best assassin on the planet.[1]
            In the aftermath, House Organa fiercely pressured government authorities to place a contract on Selven's head, arguing that for this mass murderer to run loose threatened the lives of countless innocents. Despite this, the bitter rivalry that had existed between House Organa and House Ulgo was well-known, and there were many in the public that speculated that it was the Organas that had hired Selven to eliminate the Ulgos, and that they hoped her death would keep this secret from being exposed.[1]
            In 3956 BBY, her bounty was posted by Zax, the Hutt in charge of the bounty office at Javyar's Cantina in the Lower City. Numerous bounty hunters attempted to collect the bounty, but every last one of them were killed by Selven. When the Sith Empire occupied the planet during the Jedi Civil War, the assassin was not intimidated by the Sith troopers that confronted her, slaying any that treated her as a hostile.[1]
            The amnesiac, former Revan, stranded on Taris for the time being due to the Sith quarantine, decided to undertake this bounty after meeting with Zax. With his companions, he managed to locate Selven hiding out at an apartment in the Lower City, and at his hands the assassin finally met her demise.
            Revan would go on to claim the bounty on her before his escape from Taris.[1]
            As the exterminator of an entire house on Taris, Selven held the reputation of a ruthless killer bereft of a conscience and loyal only to money. She was infamous as the most dangerous assassin on Taris in her time, and she would proudly remind this to her enemies. When dealing with strangers, her demeanor was harsh and cold-hearted, confidently maintaining her control over the confrontation through intimidation. As a fugitive, she regarded all with suspicion, taking virtually no chances with any strangers, and asserting authority through gunpoint by establishing only she was allowed to pose questions. With her heavy experience in the art of bloodshed, she did not fear death and was swift to mete it out to those hostile to her.[1]
            In spite of her mercilessness, she was willing to allow trepassers a second chance to rethink their course if they claimed they were merely lost. Even so, this would be accompanied by an express warning that another misstep would be greeted with immediate retaliation without chance for negotiation: a warning that she made with relentless sincerity.[1]
            Selven by 3956 BBY had earned the reputation as the most dangerous assassin on Taris, a title that was justified by her ability to slaughter every member of the Ulgo family day-after-day in spite of all the efforts of local enforcement and the Ulgos' guards to stop her. Her methods of assassination went beyond mere conventional combat as she was cited by Zax to have been capable of poisoning people in their own homes. Even in spite of her notoriety, she managed to continuously evade the government authorities and all other bounty hunters. Only Revan and his friends possessed the skills necessary to find and defeat her.[1]
            In battle, she commonly relied on rapidly firing volleys of blaster bolts but was entirely capable of precision shooting. More than that, she was highly trained in swordsmanship, turning to it if the gap between her and her enemies closed.[1]
            In battle, Selven donned the conventional battle armor of the Jedi Civil War era which provided her ample protection against enemy weapons. She primarily utilized a single heavy blaster pistol but kept a vibrosword at the ready if the situation demanded close-quarters combat.[1]
            At the time of her death, she additionally had in her possession a pair of neural bands, an adrenaline amplifier, and a sniper rifle scope.[1]
            Selven is a non-player character in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, serving as one of several bounties that the player, Revan, can collect on Taris.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Selven</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSelven</string></dict>

        <key>Korr Sella</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.212.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Korr Sella, also known by the nickname Korrie, was a female human military officer who served as a commander in the naval forces of the Resistance during its conflict with the First Order. She served under the command of General Leia Organa as her envoy to the New Republic, delivering warnings from the general about the actions of the First Order—warnings that generally fell on deaf ears in the Galactic Senate. Sella was on Hosnian Prime, the capital of the Republic, to deliver a warning when the First Order destroyed the planet using their Starkiller Base superweapon, killing Sella and the rest of Hosnian Prime's population.
            Sella was born in 12 ABY to Sondiv Sella[1] and a fellow New Republic politician.[3] In 28 ABY, when Sella was sixteen years old, she followed in the footsteps of her parents by entering public service, working for Senator Leia Organa at the Galactic Senate on the galactic capital Hosnian Prime. One of her jobs in the service of Organa was to prepare review holos for her so the senator could recognize each delegate in attendance at official events. Her employer Organa was a member of the Populists, a faction in the Senate that favored the decentralized New Republic. The Populists clashed with the Centrists, who advocated a stronger central government and military.[1]
            Following a ceremony to dedicate a statue to the memory of the late Senator Bail Organa, Sella suggested that Leia accept an invitation from the Centrist Senator Bevicard to attend a reception on Coruscant in order to build friendship between the Centrists and Populists. In response, Organa explained that the invitation was only a symbolic gesture and that Bevicard would be mortified if she had actually accepted it. When Sella asked whether the two factions were really apart, Leia clarified that this was indeed the case. Sella and another staffer Greer Sonnel were present when a frustrated Leia expressed her desire to quit the Senate.[1]
            Later, Sella accompanied Leia Organa, Greer Sonnel, and the pilot Joph Seastriker, and the Centrist Senator Ransolm Casterfo on a senatorial mission to investigate the Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di's cartel, which was based on Bastatha. The group traveled aboard Leia's personal starship, Mirrorbright. During the journey, Casterfo tried to make conversation with Sella but she came up with the excuse of having to review her work. While visiting a casino in Bastatha, Sella took the opportunity to practice the diplomatic courtesies that Sonnel had taught her. When Leia played a game of cards with the local Niktos, Sella offered to record a tally of her wins and losses. However, Organa told her to enjoy her drink.[1]
            After Casterfo rescued Leia from Rinnrivin's underground headquarters, Sella ran a preliminary data analysis of the crime lord's droids and discovered that the crime lord was channeling his gambling and smuggling profits into shadow corporations on various Outer Rim worlds. After Leia returned to Hosnian Prime, Sella joined C-3PO and Sonnel in encouraging Organa to nominate herself for First Senator, a post that had been proposed by the Centrists to end the deadlock in the New Republic. While the Populists had initially opposed the idea, they decided to nominate one of their own in order to prevent a Centrist from occupying that office.[1]
            A few days later, Sella offered to bring a cushion for Senator Organa to relax after a busy day hosting several visitors including the leader of the Association of Small Craft Manufacturers, ore traders from Gad, and several junior senators from Populist worlds in the Outer Rim. Leia declined because she did not want to fall asleep in her office. Shortly later, the Centrist Senator Lady Carise Sindian visited to obtain a document that allowed her to inherit the Supreme governorship of Birren. Since Leia was not interested in that position, she had transferred it to Lady Carise. While on Birren, Lady Carise discovered information on Leia's parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader. Unknown to everyone else, Lady Carise was a secret agent of the First Order, an Imperial remnant, and was working behind the scenes to destabilize the New Republic.[1]
            Later, Sella survived a bomb attack that destroyed half the Senatorial conference building. Sella was not wounded by the bomb but was frightened. She found her friend Greer Sonnel, who had also escaped the bombing, and the two managed to find Leia after being tended to by a medical droid. Following the so-called "Napkin Bombing," Sella accompanied Leia, Seastriker, and C-3PO on a mission to Ryloth to search the planet's archives for information about Rinnrivin's cartel. After three hours, Sella complained that everything in the archives was written on paper. She also uncovered information about Rinnrivin's origins as a lowly spice dealer before becoming a major crime lord in the past seven years. Based on the records, Sella theorized that Rinnrivin was channeling funds to Centrist worlds and suggested that the Centrists were also funding him.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korr_Sella</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKorrSella</string></dict>
        <key>Cellvanta Grathan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.213.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cellvanta Grathan was a Human female Sith who was the wife of the rebel Sith Lord Grathan of the Sith Empire and mother of Beelzlit Grathan.
            During the Cold War, Cellvanta and her lover trained their son who was still an acolyte recognizing her son as a Light Sith for his selfless affection and care for her. In 3643 BBY, she lived in her husband's estate on Dromund Kaas where she remained with her son until the arrival of Darth Baras' apprentice, who was sent to kill Beelzlit. Cellvanta attempted to protect her son from the Sith and quickly told him to run, but Beelzlit fought to protect her instead. The mother and son engaged the Sith Warrior in a fight but were easily defeated. Badly beaten, Cellvanta begged for mercy pleading to know what she or her son had done wrong. Realizing that her husband had gotten both her and her son Beelzlit into the whole sith affair due to both his dealings and the dark side tried to bargain with the Apprentice. Hoping to save her son, she offered the Sith Warrior her husband, Lord Grathan's, life in exchange for Beelzlit's. The Sith Warrior refused her offer and chose to kill them both. Cellvanta quickly told her son again to run, but Beelzlit chose to remain behind and die alongside her. Cellvanta was stabbed by the Sith Warrior before she could do anything more.
            If Cellvanta is spared for a light side option, she convinces the Sith warrior to kill her husband and allow her son to take his place. If the Sith warrior is male, after he kills Grathan, she offers the Sith apprentice the chance to become "intimate". She later sends a gift to her new lover through Ralesk, her former husband's top assassin. Possibly unknown to her, her son also tasked him with silencing her lover, so his secret identity would remain a secret. Ralesk fails in his attempt, being defeated by the Sith warrior, both intents remaining unaccomplished.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cellvanta_Grathan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemCellvantaGrathan</string></dict>

        <key>Tyria Sarkin Tainer</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.215.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tyria Sarkin Tainer was a female Human from Toprawa and an Antarian Ranger. She was also somewhat Force-sensitive, a fact which helped her gain entrance to the New Republic Starfighter Command, but she initially showed little aptitude for either Jedi or pilot training. Her start in Starfighter Command was discolored by a corrupt training instructor, Atton Repness, who tarnished her record after she threatened to expose his fraudulent activities. After graduating at the bottom of her class, she became one of the founding members of Gray Squadron under Commander Wedge Antilles, and supplied the unit's permanent name: Wraith Squadron. The unit was quickly activated after the Battle of Folor and participated in the campaign against Warlord Zsinj and his subordinate Apwar Trigit.
            Despite not being one of the more skilled pilots in the squadron, she participated in a number of missions and distinguished herself with her abilities as an infiltrator. Sarkin eventually told her new friends in the squadron about what Repness had done to her and squadmates Garik Loran and Ton Phanan were able to find a way to expose Repness. They also helped her after she was forced to kill a brainwashed New Republic pilot trying to assassinate Han Solo. During her time in the Wraiths, Sarkin also developed an attraction for fellow Wraith Kell Tainer, whom she would later marry.
            Although Jedi Master Luke Skywalker had told her that she was not a likely candidate for Jedi Knighthood, she left the military some time after Zsinj's death to learn the ways of the Jedi Order on her own, and eventually she was confirmed as a Jedi Knight by Skywalker in her own right. She and Tainer had two children, a daughter, Jesmin, who later joined the squadron of her father and a son named Doran, who also inherited Sarkin's Force sensitivity and became her apprentice. They traveled to distant parts of the galaxy, with Sarkin Tainer teaching Doran, even as the Yuuzhan Vong War raged.
            A native of Toprawa, Sarkin was trained in her youth as an Antarian Ranger, a centuries-old militia that assisted the Jedi on especially perilous missions. Sarkin believed that it was likely the intermarriage of Jedi and Antarian rangers that had given her Force sensitivity. Sarkin's family was one of the Ranger clans that survived both the Clone Wars and the Jedi purge by going underground for decades. They survived until the bombardment of Toprawa, an event that left Tyria Sarkin the last of the Antarian Rangers.[1]
            Sarkin dreamed of training to use her Force powers, and at some point she met the Jedi Luke Skywalker. The Jedi Master put her through several Force training exercises, but did not believe that the young Antarian Ranger would progress very far in her control of the Force. Instead, he gently suggested as much to her, and Sarkin moved on to focus on other things.[1]
            Sarkin joined the New Republic to become a starfighter pilot. She knew that it was her Force potential, and certainly not her piloting aptitude that got her into the Academy. Her skills were considered insufficient in the cockpit and she was placed in remedial pilot training under then-Major Atton Repness. In the training squadron, her scores began to rise and Sarkin believed that she was improving as a pilot.[1]
            After a short time, Repness approached her with an offer: he wanted her to help him steal an X-wing starfighter by reporting equipment failure, ejecting over the ocean, and reporting the starfighter to have sunk thousands of meters below and to be unrecoverable. Repness, however, planned to meet the young pilot trainee at the ditch site and make off with the fighter to sell it on the black market. Sarkin refused, saying that she was going to turn in her crooked commanding officer to the authorities. When the seemingly-shocked Repness begged for time to set his affairs in order, Sarkin naively acquiesced and unwittingly gave the major time to cover his tracks and put her up on charges of gross insubordination. Challenging the corrupt officer again, Sarkin was confronted with the truth of her piloting scores: Repness had been recording them inaccurately high. Sarkin would have washed out of even the remedial program weeks before if her true scores had been reported. In exchange for a chance to graduate at the bottom of her class with her falsely-recorded passing marks, the young woman kept silent about Repness's crooked side business. However, her coerced behavior left her angry and bitter over what she'd been forced to do.[1]
            Not having much chance in Starfighter Command with her low scores and even lower real abilities in the cockpit, Sarkin jumped at the chance to join a new squadron formed by Rogue Leader Wedge Antilles. For the new unit, Antilles had specifically requested both pilots with commando skills, but also wash-outs and pilots with disciplinary issues—categories into which Sarkin fell. She joined the unit but was disappointed to learn that it was her Antarian Ranger skills that had caught the veteran pilot's attention. She transferred to Folor Base as one of the candidates anyway, and passed through Antilles' and Wes Janson's—the executive officer for the new unit—screening interviews.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tyria_Sarkin_Tainer</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTyriaSarkinTainer</string></dict>

            A couple of days after the Sith under Darth Malak had conquered Taris, Sarna had decided to throw a party in her apartment in order for some of the troopers to blow off some steam. At the party she became drunk on Tarisian ale despite the warnings from her friend Yun Genda, who had heard of the potency of the beverage.
            Sarna may have met the amnesiac Revan, along with Carth Onasi in the Upper City Cantina, not realizing that they were in fact Republic officers.
            Revan  and Carth proceeded to steal her armor after she passed out. Her fate is unknown.
            Sarna was an attractive young woman with red hair and brown eyes. She maintained a positive outlook on life despite her career within the ranks of the Sith.
            Sarna had no genuine loyalty to the Sith. She simply worked to make a living. She even stated that if she could find another job, she would retire her uniform.
            While conversing with Revan Sarna became intrigued by the soldier. It is possible she became attracted to him.
            Sarna will only arrange an invitation for the player if the player is male; if the player is female then they speak to Yun Genda.
            An alternative to attending the party involves heading to the northern part of the Upper City - specifically the North Apartments. The player can come across a Aqualish member of the Hidden Beks being harassed by Sith soldiers and is threatened with death. The player could intervene to save the Aqualish victim or simply allow him to get executed by the Sith Soldiers and can threaten the soldiers afterward. The player can loot a Sith uniform from one of the bodies regardless of the choice they decide to make. Once this incident takes place, Sarna and Yun Genda will no longer appear.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sarna_(Sith_military)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSarna</string></dict>
        <key>Swain</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.217.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Swain was a young female human Imperial officer. At the time of the insurgency on the planet of Lothal, she trained under Kallus to become an agent of the Galactic Empire's Security Bureau. However, after Grand Moff Tarkin arrived on the planet to find out why the local Imperials could not manage to crush a band of rebels, Swain reconsidered her career choice. Upon realizing that she did not want to be part of an organization that punished ordinary citizens without justified reason, the woman chose to defect. Along with Cogon, another officer disgusted with the Empire, she stole a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle and left Lothal in a hurry. They went in hiding on the planet Thrad, with the secret support of Imperial Senator Nadea Tural, and the help of a male Thradian named Beneda. From Thrad, Swain and Cogon were supposed to take a transport to the planet Klonoid, where they would join a rebel cell.[1]
            However, Swain's former mentor traced the stolen shuttle's signal and ended up locating the defectors' hiding place, in a spaceport of Thrad's eastern continent. Swain and Cogon tried to flee, but Kallus pursued them in the streets. The defectors managed to corner the Security agent for a moment, and Swain verbally confronted her former mentor. Her triumph, however was only short-lived, as a duo of stormtroopers barged in the alley and shot Cogon in the back. Although Kallus himself had lost hold of his signature bo-rifle, the young woman had not expected him to keep a backup weapon under his fleximetal cuirass, and she fell to a surprise stun blow. Swain, still unconscious, was brought aboard the shuttle she had stolen, where Kallus' men started torturing her for information.[1]
            Unlike many other Imperial officers, Swain cared deeply for the people of Lothal and attempted to defect to the rebellion after Tarkin's brutal subjugation of the innocent citizens. She was seen as a bright prospect by her mentor Agent Kallus, and owing to her training she was a formidable fighter in hand-to-hand combat, besting even Kallus, who had to resort to stunning her with his blaster to subdue her.[1]
            Swain was a tanned-skinned woman with auburn hair, chestnut brown eyes, and two beauty marks on the right cheek.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Swain</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSwain</string></dict>
        <key>Sariss</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.218.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sariss, alias "Prophetess", was a Force-sensitive female Human who was one of seven Dark Jedi attempting to reclaim the Valley of the Jedi some time after the Galactic Empire's defeat at the Battle of Endor.
            Born the daughter of Imperial Warlord Cronal, Sariss was trained in the ways of the Force by the Prophets of the Dark Side on Dromund Kaas. As she grew up, she became an apprentice to Inquisitor Jerec, who completed her training as a Dark Jedi. She was one of Jerec's most loyal followers.
            Sariss did not know that she was the daughter of Lord Cronal, one of the Prophets of the Dark Side who raised her in the ways of the dark side on Dromund Kaas. There, Sariss first met her later master, Jerec of the Inquisitorius in the Galactic Empire.[1] Because Cronal held to a creed of dark nihilism, the mere existence of his daughter constituted a shocking offence, as it was tribute to creation instead of destruction. Consequently, Sariss was disavowed by her father in a most horrid way possible. Cronal not only allowed his fellow Prophets to freely engage her in carnal relations, but he also partook in the repeated rape himself.[5]
            "Prophetess" was the alter ego assumed by Sariss on Tatooine, where, working in cooperation with local governor Tour Aryon,[6] she posed as a local fortune teller as cover for her true job as a spy for the Secret Order of the Empire.[1] As a fortune teller, she claimed that Wuher was the reincarnated soul of Cedo Partu. Wuher never allowed the Prophetess to enter Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina.[7]
            Right before the Battle of Yavin, as part of her espionage, she trailed Jabba Desilijic Tiure and his bodyguards to Docking Bay 94 in Mos Eisley.[6] Shortly thereafter, Sariss had to quickly make room for a group of stormtroopers rushing to the docking bay in a vain attempt to prevent the escape of the droid R2-D2, holder of datatapes containing the stolen plans of the first Death Star.[3]
            During the rebellion on Tatooine that followed the Battle of Endor, Sariss abandoned her post to become a Dark Jedi apprenticed to Jerec, although outwardly she claimed devotion to the Empire's Church of the Dark Side. In her role as a disciple of the quasi-religion, she seduced a wealthy Epicanthix mineral baron on Panatha, to whom she became engaged. She then seduced his son, Yun, whom she taught her "faith." She convinced Yun to kill his own father. She then gave the baron's wealth to Jerec and also gave Yun to Jerec as an apprentice.[1]
            With the death of Emperor Palpatine in 4 ABY, Sariss assisted Jerec to rebuild the collapsing Empire and search for the Valley of the Jedi, a Force nexus formed in the final battle of the New Sith Wars more than a thousand years ago. After learning that Jedi Master Qu Rahn might have known the location of the valley, Sariss, Yun, and Maw led the landing party, which consisted of two skimmers. They were able to capture Rahn and his rebel companions and took them over to Jerec's Super Star Destroyer, the Vengeance. The rebels were already executed, and Jerec was able to probe Rahn's mind and discovered that although Qu Rahn did not know the location of the valley, his friend Morgan Katarn, killed by Jerec several years ago, did and had kept the map leading to it in his home on the planet Sulon. Eventually, Qu Rahn broke free and fought against the Seven Dark Jedi. Sariss, Boc, and Yun engaged him, but they were no match until Jerec intervened and killed Rahn.[2][8]
            After killing Rahn, Sariss, Boc, and Yun traveled to Sulon to gather the pieces of the map and use 8t88 to decode the map. She ordered her apprentice to travel to the city of Barons Hed while she returned to the Vengeance to inform the success on searching the map.[2][8] They were able to find the location where the Valley of the Jedi was hidden, and the planet was known to be Ruusan.[2][9]
            A short time later, Sariss spoke with Yun, who told him that Jerec acknowledged that Yun did well with the rock. She gave him his next assignment—to find out what happened to Patrol Zulu, Able, Mary 341, which was long overdue. Sariss later accompanied Jerec when the Dark Jedi Master confronted Katarn, who was furious after killing Maw on a landing pad near Jerec's personal cargo ship, the Sulon Star. Jerec tried to turn Katarn to the dark side by persuading him to kill his partner and love, Jan Ors, whom Jerec's men had captured earlier. Katarn managed to hold off his anger and stay with the light, and Yun watched as his Master pushed the Jedi into the Sulon Star and then sent the doomed ship towards the surface.[2][9]
            Katarn managed to escape from the Sulon Star in his own ship, the Moldy Crow, though he crashed the vessel in the process. He was later found unconscious by Sariss, Boc, and Yun and took him over to the caves where he would be executed. Sariss then attempted to execute Katarn with her lightsaber, but Yun, whose body seemed to act on its own, blocked Sariss's blow, which accidentally deflected against him, inflicting a mortal wound. With a few tears coming down her eyes, she didn't know why Yun would turn against her. Yun eventually told her that Kyle was a true Jedi, and that he shouldn't die, and he deserved a better battle. Watching her apprentice die, Sariss chose to spare Kyle and engage him in a duel.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sariss</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSariss</string></dict>

            Saché was one of the younger handmaidens, Yané being the youngest.[4] She and the other handmaidens were trained in self-defense and marksmanship by Queen Amidala's head of security, Captain Panaka.[5]
            During the Trade Federation Crisis, Saché and Yané remained behind when the queen and the other three handmaidens fled Naboo with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi.[2]
            Of all the handmaidens, Saché was the only one not to attend the Celebration Parade, even though she was present at Qui-Gon Jinn's funeral ceremony.[2]
            During the Galactic Civil War between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire, Saché was sent to the Mauler Stronghold, situated near the city of Keren, due to the increasing danger represented by the Maulers, a group of assassins.[3]
            Saché was portrayed by Sofia Coppola in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.[2] Coppola considers George Lucas, a long-time friend and working partner of her father Francis Ford Coppola, "like an uncle to me—he used to send me and my brother Roman Star Wars toys when we were little," and upon hearing he was going back to the saga, "thought it’d be so fun to see how they make them" as she was preparing her own directorial debut, The Virgin Suicides. When she asked Lucas if she could attend the shoot, he offered her the role of Saché, and she accepted as "it seemed like a good vantage point to watch without getting in the way."[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sach%C3%A9/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSache</string></dict>

In 22 BBY, Labooda joined Mace Windu's Jedi assault team in an effort to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi on the Separatist world of Geonosis. She was among the Jedi casualties who died during the Battle of Geonosis.
            Sar Labooda was a member of the Jedi Order prior to the Clone Wars. Her sister, Depa Billaba, also became a Jedi and served on the Jedi Council during the Invasion of Naboo and the Clone Wars.[1]
            During the Separatist Crisis, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi was captured on Geonosis while investigating the Confederacy of Independent Systems. To rescue the captive Jedi, Jedi Master Mace Windu led a team to Geonosis. The team included Labooda. The arrival of the Jedi led to the beginnings of the Battle of Geonosis, where the Jedi engaged the Separatist Droid Army.[2] Labooda was killed during the battle.[1]
            Sar Labooda was a human[3] female. She had brown hair and fair skin. Labooda wore dark Jedi robes and wielded a green lightsaber.[2]
            Sar Labooda first appeared in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. The character was originally intended to be Depa Billaba. However, the actress used to replace Billaba's portrayer, Dipika O'Neill Joti, looked too dissimilar to Billaba.

        <key>Nomi Sunrider</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.222.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nomi Sunrider was a Human female who served as a Jedi Master and later Grand Master of the Jedi Order in the days of the Galactic Republic. Born Nomi Da-Boda, she married Andur Sunrider, who was training to become a Jedi Knight, and eventually gave birth to a baby girl, whom they named Vima. During a trip to the Stenness system, Andur was ambushed by gang members of Bogga the Hutt, who were after the Adegan crystals carried by Sunrider and her husband. The ensuing fight witnessed the murder of Andur, and Sunrider's decision to begin down the path to become a Jedi Knight. Sunrider eventually completed her training under the Jedi Master Thon, and was placed in charge of the Jedi relief mission sent to Onderon to aid Ulic Qel-Droma in the Freedon Nadd Uprising. Along with several other Jedi, Sunrider helped Qel-Droma bring about the end of the Naddist Revolt, essentially putting an end to the reign of the Sith on Onderon. Following those events, Sunrider was one of many Jedi to participate in the Great Sith War against the rise of Exar Kun and his apprentice, the fallen Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma. During the war, Sunrider witnessed Qel-Droma slay his own brother Cay and, guided by her intense emotions, used her powers to permanently sever Qel-Droma from The Force. With Sunrider's defeat of Qel-Droma, the Sith War was soon brought to an end.
            Following the devastation of the Great Sith War, Sunrider steadily climbed the ranks of the Jedi and was eventually made Grand Master of the Jedi Order around the time of the Conclave on Exis Station, a conclave which Sunrider had assembled so the Jedi could discuss the rebuilding of the Order following the end of the war. Years after her death, her legacy was preserved in the histories of the Jedi and her stories were retold down through the centuries.
            The young woman Nomi Da-Boda[9] married Jedi Knight Andur Sunrider and gave up her maiden name. However, when she began her life with Andur, Sunrider found herself in constant awe of her husband's deep connection with the Force. Although he constantly told her that she too possessed the same power he did, Sunrider could not begin to entertain the thought that she was able to control the Force as her husband could.[10]
            Sunrider lived with her husband on the planet of Darada, and later went with Andur when he was invited to H'ratth by Master Chamma to receive further instruction in the ways of the Force. While on this planet, Sunrider gave birth to a baby girl, whom she and Andur named Vima. After several years of training on H'ratth, Andur had learned everything that his master could teach him, and Chamma instructed Andur to travel to the planet Ambria in the Stenness system to finish his Jedi training under Master Thon. Andur was also provided with several Adegan crystals to give to his new Master. Andur followed Chamma's orders and took his wife, daughter, and the family's personal droid A-3DO aboard the Lightside Explorer to the Stenness system.[10]
            After leaving H'ratth, Sunrider and her family arrived at a hyperspace terminal located just outside of the Stenness system. Once the couple had docked at the space station, they were set upon by members of Bogga the Hutt's gang, who had overheard Andur and Sunrider discussing the Adegan crystals they were carrying.[1]
            Several of the criminals managed to apprehend and hold A-3D0 captive, using the droid as a diversion. Andur confronted the criminals, with his family close by, but was attacked by one of the thugs, who threw a gorm-worm at him. The gorm-worm's bite was venomous and fatal, and Andur died within moments of being bitten by the small reptile. Sunrider, upon seeing her husband killed by the criminals, rushed to his side, only to be threatened by the thugs who demanded that she hand over the crystals.[1] At that moment Andur appeared as a Force ghost to his grief-stricken wife and told her that now was not the time for tears, but that she must pick up his lightsaber and defend herself and her daughter.[11] Sunrider reluctantly retrieved Andur's fallen lightsaber and attacked the criminals, killing the one named Quanto along with another. The remaining criminals fled from Sunrider's sudden onslaught and retreated back to Bogga—without the Adegan crystals—to tell him what had transpired.[1]
            However, following the withdrawal of the gang, Sunrider immediately felt immense guilt over killing the two criminals. Andur, though, revealed his Force ghost to Sunrider again and advised her that their time together was over—that she must now walk the road which she was afraid to tread. Sunrider listened as Andur told her that she must continue the journey to Ambria, and once there, find Master Thon, who would train her in the ways of the Force. Sunrider agreed to honor her husband's final wishes, gathering both her daughter and A-3DO into the Lightside Explorer and departed for Ambria. Though Sunrider had not yet started her Jedi training, she could feel Thon's presence in the Force standing out like a torch in a dark room, and used it to find the way to her destination.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nomi_Sunrider</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemNomiSunrider</string></dict>

        <key>Rahasia Sandral</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.224.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rahasia Sandral was a Human female who lived on Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War. She was the daughter of landowner Nurik Sandral.
            Rahasia was born in the Core Worlds on the planet of Coruscant to Nurik Sandral. The name and history of her mother is unknown, only that she died giving birth to Rahasia. Rahasia was the youngest of two children, and had an older brother named Casus. By the end of the Mandalorian Wars, Nurik decided to move his small family away from the destruction and corruption of the Inner Rim. He chose a quaint planet in the Outer Rim named Dantooine and invested in the construction of a large estate on the peaceful plains of the planet.
            To Nurik's dismay, the peace that he had sought on Dantooine only lasted for a few short years. It wasn't death; it wasn't politics; and it wasn't disease; it was Ahlan Matale. Not many know what the real cause of the Sandral/Matale feud was. Perhaps it was the border dispute between the two men; or when Nurik's droid shipment went missing; or the random acts of vandalism on Ahlan's estate. Either way, the two men hated each other almost to the point of going to war.
            Nurik barred Rahasia and Casus from interacting with any member of the Matale family, especially Ahlan's only son, Shen Matale. But Nurik could not keep his kids caged for long. Rahasia frequently accompanied her brother Casus on his exploration of the plains of Dantooine, as he was an amateur archaeologist. One day, Casus and Rahasia met Shen. It wasn't long before Shen became friends with Casus and fell in love with his younger sister, Rahasia.
            But all was not to last. Casus went missing, and distraught with grief, Nurik turned to the man he despised, Ahlan Matale. Nurik blamed Ahlan for Casus' disappearance, and it wasn't long before he kidnapped Shen Matale. When Rahasia found out about her father's actions, she became hysterical. What would Nurik do to Shen? Kill him? Torture him? She didn't know what to do, until Revan showed up.
            Revan came into the courtyard of the Sandral's estate and questioned Nurik about Shen's disappearance. Nurik denied that he knew anything about Shen's disappearance but brought up that his son, Casus, had also gone missing. Revan gave Nurik a datapad and told him that Casus had been killed by kath hounds out on the plains. Nurik, tortured with grief, took the datapad and left the courtyard, saying he knew nothing of Shen's disappearance. Rahasia had eavesdropped on all of this, and once Nurik had left, she went out in the courtyard and told Revan everything. Everything from her and Shen's love to Nurik kidnapping Shen. Revan told her that he would have to confront Nurik, but she begged him not to judge Nurik too harshly. Rahasia gave Revan a pass key to the back of the house, telling him that Shen was in one of the holding cells. Revan left, and Rahasia went to her room, praying that the Jedi would save Shen.
            Ten minutes after Rahasia went into her room, Revan came in and told her that Shen would not leave unless she met him outside of the Sandral Estate. A smile played at Rahasia's lips as she told Revan that she would meet them just beyond the Sandral estate. Revan left, and Rahasia quickly made her way to the borders of the Sandral estate.
            When Rahasia saw Shen come out and meet him, she ran up to him and held him in a fierce embrace. Shen and Rahasia both thanked Revan for all he had done. Before they could leave, Ahlan came up to them with two assault droids flanking him. He soon began to shout obscenities at Revan, Shen, and Rahasia. Soon after, Nurik came out of his estate with his own two battle droids. Ahlan and Nurik engaged in an intense debate filled with sneering, mocking, and arguing. Shen and Rahasia both pleaded with them to stop the fighting, but it wasn't until Revan stepped in that the two old men actually listened. Revan, backed up by Shen and Rahasia, reasoned with Nurik and Ahlan to stop the fighting and let Shen and Rahasia get married. The two began to talk to each other about it and finally decided that they would build Rahasia and Shen their own estate. Rahasia and Shen both thanked Revan for what he did for them.
            It is possible for the player to convince Shen and Rahasia to run away to the Jedi Enclave. The lovers plan allow their fathers to have the chance to forgive them and welcome them back, or build a future somewhere else if their fathers don't change. If this happens, Rahasia likely dies when Darth Malak attacks the Enclave.
            Also, if the player follows the dark side, he can lie to Nurik to make him think that Ahlan killed Casus Sandral. If this happens, a fight between Nurik and Ahlan breaks out and Rahasia is killed by Ahlan after Nurik kills Shen.
            The player can also tell Shen that his relationship with Rahasia won't work out or manipulate him into hating Rahasia. If this happens, Shen dumps her and returns home with his father, leaving her heartbroken and in her father's care.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rahasia_Sandral</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRahasiaSandral</string></dict>
        <key>Salmara</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.225.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Salmara was a female Human Jedi Master and a member of the Jedi Order during the last years of the Galactic Republic. She was the Master of Dray. She also became a victim of the reborn Sith Lord Darth Maul.
            Salmara, a female Human Jedi Master, served the Jedi Order during the last years of the Galactic Republic, during the Clone Wars. Around 20 BBY, the Jedi Council learned that the Sith Lord Darth Maul had survived his encounter with Obi-Wan Kenobi over a decade prior, and that he had allied himself with his younger brother and fellow Sith, Savage Opress.[2]
            After the Jedi Council learned that Ja'Boag, the head of Rim Commercial Mining, had placed a bounty on the heads of Maul and Oppress, they summoned Salamara and her Padawan, Dray, to the High Council Chamber. En route, Dray repeatedly questioned Salmara, claiming that there was no way Darth Maul could still be alive, but Salmara assured him that the hatred within Maul was certainly capable of such a thing. The Council then tasked Salmara, along with fellow Jedi Master Judd, with discovering the reasons behind Ja'Boag's bounty. Salamara wondered how someone outside of the Jedi Order could possibly know that Maul had lived—Mace Windu told her that this was precisely what they needed to find out, while at the same time treading lightly around someone as powerful as Ja'Boag. Judd asked what they were to do if they discovered the actual location of the dark side brothers, and Yoda told him that Kenobi was already tracking them, but they should assist him if they can. Windu also tasked Salmara and the others with uncovering why the native population of Moorjhone had fallen silent since Ja'boag's mining company arrived there. He urged the trio to follow the Force and act accordingly.[2]
            Maul and Opress also traveled to Moorjhone and arrived before the Jedi, slaughtering the security forces and flinging Ja'Boag off a balcony. The Jedi arrived just in time, and Salmara caught Ja'Boag with the Force, saving his life. As Judd ignited his lightsaber, the two Zabrak brothers looked down on them from above—Opress was concerned that they had been discovered while Maul was filled with malicious delight.[2]
            After Salmara saved Ja'Boag, the Gossam ordered his troops to attack, but Salmara urged them to wait. She then attempted to negotiate with the Sith brothers, asking them to surrender. Opress responded by telling her that they would all die, and Judd mocked Salmara for her "good diplomacy". The Nightbrothers attacked, slaughtering Ja'Boag's troopers. Judd threw himself in their path, clashing his lightstaff against their blades. Maul reacted quickly, bashing his lightsaber hilt against Judd's snout, causing blood to spray out. Judd surprised the two Zabraks by knocking Opress on his back and deflecting Maul's counterattack. He then mocked Maul for his lack of legs, but Opress unleashed his rage, knocking both combatants away.[3]
            Salmara flung a large container at Opress, and though Maul warned him, he lashed out without a thought, opening the container—which was full of carbonite. Opress was instantly frozen solid, to Maul's horror. Judd again mocked Maul for his cybernetic half, but Maul grabbed Judd's right arm in his foot and snapped his bones. Maul then told Judd that he would have liked to have taken longer killing him, but was suddenly stabbed from behind by Dray. Maul slashed at Dray, severed both of Dray's hands and flung them away.

        <key>Berisse Sai</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.232.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Berisse Sai was a human female officer in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War. She befriended a fellow officer Ciena Ree, and served the Death Squadron aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Devastator following her graduation from the Imperial Academy on Lothal. Later she served aboard the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor. She was killed when the Executor was destroyed at the Battle of Endor.
            Berisse Sai graduated from the Imperial Academy on Lothal a year before the Battle of Yavin. Lieutenant Sai was stationed aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer where she befriended Lieutenant Ciena Ree, a Jelucani graduate from the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant, and promised to show her around the Star Destroyer. After learning about the destruction of Alderaan, she offered some sympathy for the Alderaanian Imperial officer Nash Windrider, remarking that his entire planet had turned traitor.[1]
            Following the destruction of the Death Star, Sai and Ree were ordered to take a Gozanti-class freighter to the Yavin system to rendezvous with Darth Vader and bring him back to the Devastator. Their commander ordered them to keep their mission secret and to maintain communications silence unless otherwise ordered by Lord Vader. During the hyperspace journey, Berisse asked Ciena whether they were supposed to fly to the totally silent Death Star without asking questions.[1]
            Ciena responded that it would make more sense when they got there. Sai introduced herself as Berisse and Ciena followed suit. Upon exiting hyperspace, the two stumbled upon the wrecked remains of the Death Star, which had been destroyed by the Rebel Alliance starfighter pilot Luke Skywalker. After picking up a signal from Darth Vader's TIE Advanced x1, Berisse helped Ciena extend the docking tube onto the top of Vader's TIE fighter.[1]
            After boarding the freighter, Vader ordered Ciena and Berisse to remain in the hold for the remainder of the voyage. He then took command of the freighter for their return journey to the Devastator. During the return journey, an apologetic Berisse remarked that Vader could be a little overpowering at first glance. When Berisse added that she was frightened by his respirator, Ciena warned that he could be monitoring them right now. Berisse kept quiet for the rest of the journey.[1]
            Several days later, Berisse was resting in her bunk when Ciena raised the matter of Windrider's stressed state. Berisse thought that Ciena was thinking about Nash because it was the only thing that kept her from thinking about her fellow Jelucani officer Thane Kyrell. Ciena denied having any romantic feelings for Thane. Berisse responded that she had observed Ciena's infatuation with Thane during her off-duty hours. When Ciena returned to the subject of Nash, Berisse responded that he was taking extra shifts to keep himself busy. Berisse supported Ciena's suggestion that they invite Thane out for grav-ball.[1]
            Two years after the Battle of Yavin, Berisse along with Nash and Ciena were transferred to Vader's flagship, the Super Star Destroyer Executor. Berisse's birthday occurred shortly before the Battle of Hoth. Despite driving the rebels from Echo Base and killing hundreds of rebels, Vader's strike force lost three AT-AT walkers, several dozen TIE fighters, and hundreds of snowtroopers. Other rebel forces managed to escape and rejoin the Alliance Fleet.[1]
            Following the escape from Cloud City, Berisse met with Ciena and Nash. When Ciena asked why people would join the Rebellion, Berisse dismissed them as misfits and robbers who hated normal society. When Berisse and Nash asked why she had raised the matter, Ciena confided that she was still affected by Thane's alleged suicide. Berisse and Nash were unaware that Thane had joined the Rebel Alliance. When Nash expressed disbelief that Thane would commit suicide, Berisse explained that they were all affected by the destruction of the Death Star.[1]
            After Nash had pressed Ciena for more information about Thane, Berisse speculated that it was something that had happened on his homeworld of Jelucan. Nash shared pointed out that Thane had been physically abused by his father Oris Kyrell, stating that he had seen scars on his back. Berisse then departed and let Ciena and Nash spend time together.[1]
            In the period leading up to the Battle of Endor, the Executor was dispatched to the Hudalla system. During that time, Berisse noticed that Ciena had been angry for the past three weeks. Ciena was angry that her mother Paron Ree had been framed and imprisoned for embezzlement. Despite being close friends, Ciena did not confide in Berisse because of her friend's loyalty to the Empire. While waiting, Berisse assisted Ciena in a flamethrower training session by operating the holographic visuals. Shortly later, the Executor exited hyperspace in the Hudalla system and discovered a large Imperial fleet. Both Berisse and Ciena expressed bemusement. The Imperial fleet had been dispatched to lure rebel starfighters into a trap, leading to a dogfight. During the dogfight, Ciena and Nash "discovered" that Thane had joined the Rebel Alliance.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Berisse_Sai</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBerisseSai</string></dict>

        <key>Sabé</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.234.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sabé (pronounced /sɑ'beɪ/) was a Human female who served as a loyal handmaiden to Queen Padmé Amidala during her reign as Monarch of Naboo. A native of Naboo, Sabé was handpicked by Captain Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces shortly after Amidala's coronation, due to her strong resemblance to the new queen. Along with the other handmaidens, Sabé was trained to serve as both an attendant and a bodyguard, and as the most important of her group, she was chosen to be the first in line to take the queen's place in times of crisis, as a decoy. Together with Amidala, Sabé perfected her act as queen, learning to mimic the monarch accurately.
            Sabé was required to step into the role during the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY. When the Trade Federation subjugated the capital city of Theed, the handmaiden donned one of the queen's gowns, while Amidala took Sabé's role, using concealed gestures and signals to communicate. Before they were taken into Federation custody, Sabé and her "retinue" were rescued by the Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. In attempting to flee Naboo in the queen's J-type 327 Nubian royal starship, the group was forced to make a detour to Tatooine in order to repair the craft before journeying to Coruscant.
            Once on Coruscant, Amidala attempted to reason with the Galactic Senate, and hoped to receive aid to help remove the Federation from Naboo. No such help came her way, however, and she was forced to take matters into her own hands. Sabé once again took on the role of the queen in an attempt to persuade the Gungans to help fight the Federation. Sabé's attempts failed, forcing the real Amidala to reveal her identity. The revelation impressed the Gungan leader, Boss Rugor Nass, and he agreed to aid the Naboo. Sabé then participated in the Battle of Naboo, helping to defeat the Federation and free her planet.
            Sabé was a handmaiden in the service of Padmé Amidala, Queen of Naboo.[1] Amidala's head of security, Captain Panaka, handpicked Sabé and the other handmaidens following the queen's coronation and had them trained in gymnastics, hand-to-hand combat and small arms handling. Despite their ability to serve as bodyguards, the handmaidens would also serve Amidala on a more personal level, tending to her outfits and hairstyles.[6]
            Thinking ahead, Panaka devised a scheme to ensure the queen's safety in times of crisis. Sabé, who bore a striking resemblance to Amidala, would adopt the role of the queen, while Amidala herself would pose as a handmaiden.[7] The pair developed a set of signals they would use, while in disguise, to convey messages without arousing suspicion.[1] The queen would give her dialect lessons to aid her mimicry, but Sabé was always afraid that she would give away the ruse.[8] Though Sabé was usually first in line to play the role of "false queen," the other handmaidens could also fill the position if needs be.[6] Due to her role as Amidala's decoy, Sabé was considered to be the most important of the queen's bodyguards. During her time as a handmaiden, Sabé became close friends with Amidala.[8]
            The handmaidens would constantly train at a secret compound set up by Panaka, located just outside Theed. There, they would hone their marksmanship under the captain's supervision. The training area included an obstacle course that the handmaidens had to navigate while constantly being harried by a floating training droid. One day, the handmaidens were joined by a newcomer, named Padmé. Yané and Eirtaé successfully completed the course that day, but Rabé encountered some potentially fatal difficulties. Hit in the arm by the training droid's non-lethal blaster fire, Rabé returned fire, but even a direct hit was unable to down the droid. Padmé and Sabé also opened fire on the training device, to no avail. The duo quickly realized that something had gone amiss with the droid, and it pursued the fleeing Rabé to a nearby waterfall while Yané went to alert the compound's droid control.[6]
            While Rabé waited on the treacherous footing near the waterfall, Sabé, acting quickly, fired a cable at a nearby branch. Padmé swung from the cable, lashing out at the training droid and knocking it wildly off course. She then retrieved the injured Rabé from her dangerous position. When everyone was safe, Padmé revealed that she was in fact the queen, and in doing so she assured her handmaidens that their loyalty to her was returned in kind.[6]
            In 32 BBY, the forces of the Trade Federation invaded Naboo as a part of their protest of the taxation of trade routes. Knowing that the queen would be in danger, Captain Panaka initiated his scheme to ensure the safety of Amidala. Sabé, due to her close resemblance to Amidala, took on her guise, while Amidala adopted handmaiden attire and used her birth name of "Padmé Naberrie."[9] Before the ruse could be completed, however, it was discovered that the queen's amulet had gone missing. Sabé helped Amidala locate the object in a nearby meadow, allowing her costume to be completed.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sab%C3%A9/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSabe</string></dict>
        <key>Keelyvine Reus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.235.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Keelyvine Reus was a Human female Jedi General during the Clone Wars. She had the tutelage of the Padawan Tyzen Xebec foisted upon her during the conflict after Xebec's former Master, Bolla Ropal, was slain by the bounty hunter Cad Bane. She was teamed with Admiral Dron and Jedi Master Kit Fisto on an expedition to the vital agriworld Ukio, which supplied the Grand Army of the Republic with food supplies. The emergence of the Confederate tactical droid "Doctor," and his plot to ruin the planet's crops resulted in an engagement, with the Republic emerging victorious thanks to the actions of Xebec and Reus, among others.
            Reus's next mission with Xebec involved her being dispatched to the Valsedian asteroid belt, which was home to a key mining operation that had allegedly been sold to the Confederacy by Torpo the Hutt. As the asteroid belt was held by the Hutt Cartel, there was a diplomatic sensitivity that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was loathe to breach. Reus and Xebec, along with Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his own Padawan Ahsoka Tano infiltrated the asteroid belt's mining facility, before breaking up to better determine the nature of the supposed Confederate presence there. As a result, Reus encountered Confederate agent Asajj Ventress, and fought a duel with the woman, discovering in the process that Torpo was in fact a patsy in a scheme of Jabba Desilijic Tiure's design. The Jedi were nonetheless able to liberate the Ugnaught workers at the facility.
            Keelyvine Reus was a Human female Jedi Knight, who was instructed in the art of lightsaber combat by Jedi Master Dooku—a hard task-master who demanded excellence from the young woman.[2] Reus later served as a General during the Clone Wars. In that pan-galactic conflict, during which the Confederacy of Independent Systems battled the Galactic Republic for supremacy, Reus was forced to take a Padawan learner, Tyzen Xebec, a Zabrak male. Xebec's former Jedi Master, Bolla Ropal, had been slain by the Confederate-allied bounty hunter Cad Bane in the wake of a battle at Devaron, and so Reus took Ropal's place as the Zabrak's instructor. She had also inherited Ropal's clone trooper commander, one nicknamed "Ganch." Teamed with fellow Jedi Kit Fisto, as well as Admiral Dron, Reus commanded a Republic fleet consisting of a Venator-class Star Destroyer and two Consular-class frigates.[1]
            The fleet was dispatched to Ukio, a vital agriworld that supplied the Republic troops with food. Upon being informed of their arrival by Dron, Reus instructed the Admiral to have her frigates form a sentry line, while the fleet was to be placed on yellow alert. Fisto could not detect any hint of danger, but Reus was adamant that any danger that they could not sense would prove the most potent. A clone informed Reus that they were receiving an incoming intelligence update from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Reus halted the briefing until Xebec was summoned to the bridge.[1]
            Reus and Fisto were contacted by Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu, and upon Xebec's arrival, the briefing commenced. The Jedi, along with Dron, conferred with Coruscant as to the background of Ukio's involvement in the war. Windu informed them that Ukio was not only vital to the Republic, but that it also supplied the entire Abrion sector and Triellus Trade Route with food. The planet had attempted to secede from the Republic just prior to the opening of the Clone Wars, but had been prevented from doing so by Grand Master Yoda. Kenobi noted that the citizenry were still divided, and that the planet was in enough political turmoil that it might attract the attention of Confederate agents such as Asajj Ventress, or even the enemy figurehead,[1] her old saber instructor Count Dooku.[2] Xebec was curious as to why the Confederacy would be interested in Ukio, as their droid army had no mouths to feed—Reus pointedly reminded him that their objective was likely stopping the Republic's supply rather than claiming the crops for themselves.[1]
            Clone Intelligence had determined that Ukio was indeed possibly being targeted by the Confederacy, but aiding the Republic was the fact that the planet was protected by a powerful planetary shield. Consulting a readout, Reus noted that the shield would be strong enough to deflect a considerable enemy bombardment, and that was what puzzled Kenobi—there had been no reports of any major Confederate fleet movements anywhere near Ukio. Windu instructed the Jedi to perform reconnaissance and inspect the situation on the planet surface. He suspected that there might be Confederate sympathizers or saboteurs among the Ukians, and Reus obeyed. Conferring with Fisto after the meeting, Reus decided that the fleet should retain orbital patrol, in case the intelligence reports were erroneous, and that they should perform sensor analysis on the planetary shield to hunt for weak spots. Reus instructed her Padawan to take a team to Ukio's surface and survey the planetary defenses. As Xebec departed, Reus confided in Fisto her feelings that the Padawan was reckless and lacked focus. The Nautolan assured her that she would eventually be able to connect with him, in time, through the Force.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Keelyvine_Reus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKeelyvineReus</string></dict>
        <key>Ciena Ree</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.236.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ciena Ree, known as LP-888 in the Imperial Navy, was a female human First Waver villager from the planet Jelucan who fought for the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. She grew up as a friend of Thane Kyrell, a second-wave aristocrat. They bonded over their love of flying and pushed each other to excel. As the most accomplished students of Jelucan's academy preparatory courses, they were both selected to attend the prestigious Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant. During their time at the academy, the friendship between the two cadets would eventually turn into romantic feelings.
            The destruction of Alderaan had an indirect cataclysmic effect on Ciena and Thane's relationship. While Ciena remained loyal to the Galactic Empire due to her belief in honor and upholding her sworn oath, Thane became disillusioned with the Empire's increasing brutality and defected to the Rebel Alliance. Despite their conflicting loyalties, the two continued to love each other. Despite eventually rising to the rank of Captain in the Imperial Navy, Ciena became increasingly disillusioned with the Empire, particularly after her mother, Verine Ree, was convicted of a crime that Ree suspected an Imperial governor had committed.
            Following the Battle of Endor, Ree was badly injured, but survived. Upon recovering, she became the Captain of the Imperial Star Destroyer Inflictor. During the Battle of Jakku, Ciena and Thane found themselves fighting on opposite sides. Thane was part of a New Republic boarding party that tried to seize control of the Inflictor. When Ciena attempted to crash the Inflictor onto Jakku's surface in an effort to deny the ship to the Republic, Thane fought his way into the command bridge and forcibly rescued her. The two survived the battle, and Ciena was taken prisoner by the New Republic.
            Ciena Ree was a rural villager from the valleys of the planet Jelucan in the Outer Rim Territories. She was the daughter of Paron and Verine Ree, who were First Wavers, the descendants of the first settlers to settle Jelucan. The valley-dwelling First Wavers had been exiled for refusing to break their allegiance to their king. The First-wavers were poorer than the Second-wave, a second group of settlers that arrived 350 years after the initial settlement wave. The more affluent Second-wavers looked down on the First Wavers as unsophisticated peasants. From her childhood, Ciena was raised by her parents to value honor and keeping her word, which would later affect her life choices.[1]
            Ree had a twin sister, Wynnet, who died only a few hours after they both were born. Though there was no way for her to remember her, she lived her life for both of them. She wore a leather bracelet as a symbol that she was still connected to her twin sister and when she saw something of significance would recite the phrase "Look through my eyes" as a reminder that she was seeing it for the both of them.[1]
            At the age of eight, Ciena accompanied her parents, Paron and Verine, on her first journey to the city of Valentia. That day, their trip to Valentia coincided with a visit by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, a senior Imperial official. Ciena took an interest in the Imperial TIE fighters and Star Destroyers on display. Curious, she decided to take a look at a parked Lambda-class shuttle behind Tarkin's stage. Shortly, she was accosted by six older Second-wave boys, who bullied her for being a First-waver.[1]
            A second-wave boy named Thane Kyrell, who was the same age as her, came to her defense and fought the bullies. Their fight was broken up by Grand Moff Tarkin, who was accompanied by his entourage of Imperial officers and stormtroopers. While the bullies ran away, Ciena and Thane stayed behind. When Tarkin approached them, Ciena apologized for getting Thane into trouble. When Tarkin counseled the young boy not to fight against superior forces, Thane pointed out that he was counting on the Grand Moff to save him. Ciena apologized for trespassing in the hangar bay, but Tarkin instead praised the children for their bravery and intelligence.[1]
            Testing their knowledge, Tarkin quizzed Ciena and Thane about the starship, which they correctly identified as a Lambda-class shuttle. Satisfied, Tarkin took them on a tour of the shuttle. After allowing them to play with the instruments in the cockpit, Tarkin took the opportunity to encourage the children to serve the Emperor and join the Imperial Military when they grew up. Following their meeting with Tarkin, the two children decided that they would endeavor to join the Imperial Navy. When Ciena revealed that she did not have a flight simulator, Thane invited her to try out his. As a result, the two formed a lasting friendship.[1]
            For the next five years, Ciena and Thane continued practicing regularly with the Kyrell family's flight simulator to further their goal of joining the Imperial Academy. By the age of thirteen, Ciena's mother, Verine, had taken a job as a supervisor at a mine which meant she had to work long hours. When their neighbor, the Nierre family's patriarch, was accused of abusing his position as an Imperial communications monitor, the Rees joined their neighbors in upholding an ancient tradition of standing with them in their hour of trial. As a sign of solidarity, they contributed a flag. Despite the seriousness of the charges, the Ree family believed that no one should want to hide secrets from the Empire and that the Nierres' accusers had no honor.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ciena_Ree</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemCienaRee</string></dict>

            Captain Filia Rossi graduated from Raithal Academy and had spent most of the following twelve years on Socorro, first based on the ground, then aboard an orbital defense platform by the system's asteroid belts and later spent a year as the first officer aboard an ore freighter escort. She was then promoted to command the Gozanti-class cruiser Blood Crow. When Rossi was placed in command, she undertook a tour of the ship with several officers, including First weapons officer Lieutenant Thrawn and Ensign Eli Vanto. When she reached the Number Two storage bay and opened the hatch, Nels Deyland and the other officers drifting to the sides of the passageway, foreshadowing Rossi's negative reaction to Thrawn storing Clone Wars antiques.[2]
            When Rossi asked Thrawn for an explanation but was not satisfied, she ordered Thrawn to dispose of his artifacts. Thrawn proposed an alternative to which Rossi agreed to listen to, which was that in his collection were two Mark One Pistoeka sabotage droids, which were rare and valuable to collectors, and that since they were property of the vessel and since Rossi was the captain of the vessel, the droids were technically hers. Thrawn indicated that they were valuable to officers in Imperial High Command, which Rossi could use for her advantage. In the end, Rossi agreed to Thrawn's proposal, and she was likely aware of the Doonium contained in the droids, which the Empire was anxious to get a hold of as many as possible.[2]
            It took Rossi a week to get fully acquainted with her ship and crew, and to Vanto's surprise, was good at her post, however, Vanto was not surprised that Rossi disliked the fact that an alien, Thrawn, had an aide, which was Vanto, and no one else on board did, and soon Thrawn and Vanto were given mediocre chores and duties. The Blood Crow was soon called to assist the Dromedar, yet also received a call for assistance on Moltok, as there was a growing crisis there. While Thrawn, Vanto, and several other crew members stayed behind to repair the Dromedar, they were captured by Nevil Cygni who was posing as part of the crew of the Dromedar. In the end, Thrawn was able to rescue the actual crew of the Dromedar and save several Tibanna gas canisters on board the freighter. When Rossi returned, she suspended Thrawn since he prioritized the lives of the Dromedar's crew instead of recapturing all gas canisters. Thrawn and Vanto were suspended, and were left behind on Ansion in an Imperial base located there to await the results of their suspension.[2]
            Filia Rossi was a younger and relatively inexperienced officer compared to her predecessor. She achieved her rank and assignment owing to her connections, though she did prove to be fairly good at her job, as Vanto noted. She was incredibly petty and had a fiery temper, and acted overtly officious towards her subordinates. She was especially hard on Thrawn and Vanto, whom she treated with nothing but contempt, mainly due to her prejudice towards aliens and anyone from Wild Space.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Filia_Rossi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemFiliaRossi</string></dict>

        <key>Risha Drayen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.241.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Risha Drayen was a Human female who was a petty criminal, starship mechanic, woman of mystery, royal queen, and daughter of the notorious crime lord Nok Drayen during the time of the Cold War. Although she was the daughter of a violent gangster, she was not emotionally scarred by her turbulent upbringing. Known to be wise and experienced beyond her years, she lived an adventurous life.
            Growing up, Risha had a very odd childhood. Her mother died while she was not yet old enough to remember her. Her father, Nok Drayen, gave her lessons on how to survive in the galaxy, including teaching her to fire a blaster while she was four years old. While Nok was running his pirate gang, a Twi'lek slave he freed, Vette, bonded with Risha and they were like sisters until they later separated. At one point Nok took his daughter to the pirate haven of Rishi, where little Risha was afraid of the black sand at first, but came to enjoy the trip by the end.[3] By the age of eleven, when Nok was forced to freeze himself in carbonite to stave off a disease a traitorous lieutenant infected him with, Risha managed to successfully make her first hyperspace jump to Dantooine, where her father had a hideout. For a few years afterwards, Dantooine's population doubled due to Risha's and her father's presence.
            By the age of fourteen, after studying many of Nok's holorecordings on the ways of criminals, she hid her father and left Dantooine under a new identity. In her travels in the intervening years, she befriended the Togruta couple, Juran and Audila Reb and had dealings with Beryl Thorne. At some point she spend some time on Makeb laying low after a successful job.[4] By the end of the Great Galactic War, the Sith Empire's Treasury Department had posted a 1,000,000 credit bounty on her head.[1]
            During the Cold War, Risha partnered with the criminal Skavak to search for her family crown, which her great-grandfather, King Arak Drayen III, had hidden away from the usurper of the throne of Dubrillion. However, the ship she was on belonged to a smuggler who was determined to get it back. When the smuggler reclaimed the ship, with Risha on it, she offered the smuggler the same deal she had given Skavak, promising that she would make her new partner "filthy rich" if they allied with her.
            In searching for the Drayen crown, Risha helped to upgrade the smuggler's ship. To accomplish this, they made deliveries to Taris, Nar Shaddaa, Tatooine and Alderaan to acquire the necessary ship upgrades.
            After getting all the upgrades, Risha received a holocall from Juran, who revealed that Audila had been kidnapped. Her kidnapper was demanding that Risha meet him on Tatooine; if not, he would kill Audila. Risha knew this was a plot of the usurper king to draw her out and enlisted the smuggler's aid in rescuing her friend, though she did not disclose her past. The meeting place with the kidnapper was in an old Czerka mine. Confirming information with her contacts, Risha was able to discover an ore processing shaft the smuggler could infiltrate and surprise the assassin while she seemingly complied with his demand.
            Upon meeting, Risha demanded that the assassin let Audila go but the assassin stated that his liege, King Actavarus III of Dubrillion, specifically ordered no witnesses. Luckily, Risha's partner was able to arrive in time and killed the assassin and his men. As a relieved Juran reunited with his wife, Audila demanded to know why she was kidnapped, to which Risha refused to answer. As a result, Audila threatened to sever ties with her but Risha and the smuggler persuaded her to give her friend another chance. Risha provided the happy couple some credits to start up elsewhere. Audila accepted but reminded her that she would want an answer someday.
            After getting off Tatooine, Risha brought the smuggler to Nar Shaddaa to introduce her partner to her father, who was frozen in carbonite. Nok gave the smuggler the location of the crown's resting place in a region of space called the Long Shadow. Once the smuggler successfully returned with the crown, Nok instructed Risha to take the crown and retake the throne of Dubrillion. Claiming that, if she was to succeed, she would need to perform many questionable actions, Risha's father ordered her to kill the smuggler, stating that one spacer would not be missed. Risha refused to kill her friend. With his dying breath, Nok expressed how disappointed he was in her. After he died, Risha instructed Doctor Chelah to dispose of her father's body according to his wishes and formally released the Selkath from her family's service.
            Turning to the smuggler, she remarked that she only had a crown but no army or armada to retake Dubrillion. Thus, she chose to stay with her friend as their first-mate. Also, she informed the Galactic Finders Guild to credit the smuggler for finding the Drayen treasure.
            In her travels with the smuggler, Risha began planning to retake Dubrillion, starting by trying to find allies among the aristocracy who detested the current king's rule. She was able to discover a possible ally in a lesser baron, but she quickly identified him as a spy for King Actavarus III. With the aid of several Hutts that owed her a favor, she set a trap for the spy on Nar Shaddaa and promised to send a holorecording of the trap to the king.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Risha_Drayen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRishaDrayen</string></dict>
        <key>Kin Robb</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.242.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kin Robb was a human female who served as a senator during the Clone Wars. During her time as a senator, she was a close ally and acquaintance of many noted figures, including Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo and Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore.
            Robb accompanied Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore aboard the Coronet along with several other senators including Orn Free Taa of Ryloth, and Onaconda Farr of Rodia. The party also included Mandalore's own Senator, Tal Merrik. Robb had drinks in the hospitality suite with Satine and the other senators, nodding and smiling politely when the Duchess introduced Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to them, though her smile faded when Kenobi and Kryze began a heated argument. After tensions were defused, Robb joined the other senators at dinner. However, while the party dined, terror hit the spacecraft, and numerous assassin probes attacked the party, having been sent by Merrik, who was a traitor. Once the probes were dealt with, they returned to dinner where they were subjected to a test of Kenobi's using the last surviving probe killer. Reasoning that the droid would attempt to kill the Duchess and her allies, Kenobi placed it near all four senators, suspects as the crate holding the droids had been marked with the Senate stamp. Robb was uncomfortable with the idea and leaned away from the droid when it was her turn, but Kenobi absolved her of suspicion by noting the droid's "unusual hostility" towards her. Merrick was exposed as the traitor and his Separatist Alliance allies attacked the vessel. Robb quickly ran to Senator Farr's aid when the probe killer attacked him. She survived the events on the Coronet.[4]
            Robb attended drinks and dinner with the Military Oversight Committee on which Padmé Amidala attempted to sway votes to try and reduce military funding. Robb seemed very happy that Senator Aang was pleased with Amidala's presentation.[5]
            Robb was among the Senators to discuss the Enhanced privacy invasion bill, in a meeting led by Senator Philo, when they were all trapped in the Senate by Cad Bane and several other bounty hunters working to free Ziro the Hutt. When Philo attempted to storm out, Bane callously shot him in the back as an example, horrifying Robb and her fellows. Robb was made to surrender any communication devices on her person and watched in shock as Anakin Skywalker was thrown into the prison. Robb was evidently also very frightened and horrified at the disgraceful injustice displayed. She and the others were nearly killed when Bane's pre-planted explosives detonated, but were saved in the nick of time when Skywalker cut through the floor and dropped them all one floor down just as the bombs went off. Though coughing and a bit dazed from the fall and smoke, Robb was unharmed.[1]
            When Padmé Amidala delivered the winning speech for the opposing side of troop escalation, Robb happily clapped with her aides, who were also cheering on the Senator from Naboo, possibly indicating support for a decrease in military spending.[6]
            When a vote to send thousands of more clones into conflict arose with Halle Burtoni as the leading senator, murders began to happen in the Senate beginning with Onaconda Farr. Robb, a close friend of the Rodian, attended his funeral and was amongst the saddest in attendance, gazing mournfully after his departing transport even after the others had left.[7]
            Following the bombing of the Jedi Temple, and Ahsoka Tano being accused of the crimes, a trial was called to decide her fate. Robb was a member of the jury pressing over the former Jedi. What Robb believed remained unknown, as Anakin Skywalker brought forward the true culprit, Barriss Offee.[8]
            After Rush Clovis, newly instated head of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, was forced to raise interest rates on the Republic, the Senate convened in session to express outrage, with Robb vocally making her anger clear by shouting that the Chancellor had been warned of such an eventuality.[9] After another emergency session was called revealing that Scipio, the location of the banks, had been invaded by the Separatists, Robb immediately called for a counter-invasion to secure the banks for the Republic, supported by many other senators.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kin_Robb</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKinRobb</string></dict>

        <key>Raina Temple</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.245.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Raina Temple was a Human female daughter of two Cipher Agents of the reconstituted Sith Empire. Born Force-sensitive, she was about to be taken by the Sith to train on Korriban, but Cipher Three hid his daughter and gave her a new identity instead, making Raina a fugitive for life. She enlisted into Imperial Military and managed to secure a transfer into the allied Chiss Ascendancy, serving in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force away from the Sith eyes. Early in the Galactic War she was posted in the secret Zero Station under Aristocra Saganu and assisted him in investigating suspicious activities of Imperial Admiral Layek Davos. She convinced the Aristocra to bring in Imperial Agent Cipher Nine, who had their own interest in Davos, and assisted them in tracking the Admiral to the Starship Graveyard. After evacuating with the agent on the Starbreeze after the mission, she was offered a position in the Imperial Intelligence, which she eagerly accepted.
            Raina joined Cipher Nine's crew aboard their X-70B Phantom-class prototype and began training in the art of espionage, subterfuge and manipulation. During this time, she learned that the Sith have finally tracked down her father, and chose to execute him herself rather than let him be tortured. Temple accompanied Cipher Nine during the Hunt for the Star Cabal and remained loyal to the agent even after the Imperial Intelligence was dissolved. She spend over five years at the agent's side, until Cipher Nine went missing during the Eternal Empire conquest, prompting Raina to abandon Dromund Kaas and return to the Chiss Ascendancy. After spending another five years passing her knowledge of Imperial espionage to Ascendancy soldiers, she accompanied Aristocra Saganu on a diplomatic visit to the Eternal Alliance, which led to her joining the Alliance Commander on a mission to the Chiss world of Copero. Though the mission was unsuccessful, Raina Temple decided to stay and continue working with the Alliance, believing her connections in the Ascendancy could be valuable there.
            Born on Dromund Kaas in 3666 BBY,[1] Raina was the daughter of two Cipher Agents of the Imperial Intelligence and was raised in Kaas City. Exposed to the best money could buy, the girl adored her father Cipher Three, who once gave her a felinx for her birthday, and reached the age of twelve before she realized that the fresh scars from his work were left after Intelligence operations.[6] She was also Force-sensitive, which by laws of the Sith Empire meant that she had to undergo training in the Dark side of the Force in the Sith Academy on Korriban. Afraid that she would not survive the training, Cipher Three was determined to keep his daughter from that fate and took necessary precautions.[7]
            By the time the Sith came for her, both of them were gone, and Cipher Three had changed his child's name, birthdate and other records[7] to ensure that no traces of her identity remained in either Imperial Enlisted Records or files of the Imperial Citizenship Bureau.[4] He then went into hiding from the Sith, while young Raina was left on her own, desperate not to reveal her connection to the Force to any Sith or high-ranking Imperials.[7] Under her new name, the young fugitive enlisted in the Imperial Military when she was of age and was able to secure a transfer to the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force, despite neither CEDF having to official transfer program with the Sith Empire.[4] Even though the Chiss themselves had a strong stigma against Force-sensitives,[8] the Chiss Ascendancy kept Raina Temple safely away from the attention of the Sith in return for her dedication,[5] granting her the rank of Ensign.[2]
            In 3643 BBY, late in the Cold War, Raina Temple was assigned to the ice planet Hoth, where she was posted in the Zero Station, a top secret Ascendancy installation that was kept hidden from the Imperials fighting in the Battle of Hoth. Initially Temple wasn't trusted because of her Human heritage, which made everyone suspect she was a spy. However, Raina soon learned her way around and proved her competence to the Chiss, making quite a few friends inside the base, though she still missed Dromund Kaas. Temple was posted on Hoth for less than a year when Zero Station Commander Aristocra Saganu began investigating unusual activities of Imperial Admiral Layek Davos. Their suspicions were raised when the Admiral brought in his own crew of officers loyal to him, ensuring their dedication with bribes, and were later confirmed when he bought arms and heavy equipment for an excursion into the Starship Graveyard. Davos launched his expedition in 3642 BBY just when Cipher Nine of the Imperial Intelligence arrived with the intention to join him. To the surprise of everyone who monitored him, Davos revealed his true intentions by ordering his men to interrogate and kill the agent. The Cipher overcame the attackers and survived, prompting Raina to convince Saganu that the situation warranted bringing the agent in, after which Chiss sergeant Ath'en'terro attached to Imperial Search and Recovery directed them to Zero Station.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Raina_Temple</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRainaTemple</string></dict>

        <key>Adea Rite</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.247.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Adea Rite was a female human who served as Admiral Rae Sloane's personal assistant after the Battle of Endor. She was present during the abortive Imperial emergency summit on the planet Akiva. Rite was taken captive by New Republic forces during the Rebellion on Akiva. However, Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax arranged her escape and Rite found herself serving Admiral Sloane again. In secret, Rite was an undercover agent of Rax, whose agenda for the Empire clashed with Sloane's personal beliefs. Rite died while attempting to kill Sloane during the attack on Chandrila.
            During the Age of the Empire, Adea Rite served as Admiral Rae Sloane's personal assistant. Her job was to hand Sloane papers, fetch cups of caf, ask for signatures, and deliver communications, but she longed to be more, to deepen her service to the Galactic Empire. She worked closely with Sloane and the two grew to respect each other, with Sloane wishing there were more Imperials like her and Rite admiring Sloane greatly. She found that there was no better time to be alive, because in the cracks of the Empire there was room for advancement for people like her.[1]
            On Akiva, during the meeting of the Imperial Future Council, Rite kept Sloane up to date on the events taking place on the planet, which were growing more tumultuous by the day. When Captain Wedge Antilles escaped their custody on Akiva, she went to chase him down personally, but was ambushed and injured by the Rebel pilot. She continued to serve Sloane, and was on the Golden Harp, their escape vessel, when it crash landed on the Vigilance. She was then captured by the New Republic.[1]
            Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax saw to it personally that she never found herself in a prison cell on Chandrila, the capital world of the New Republic. Rite returned to assist Sloane once again, aboard the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Ravager. Because Sloane did not trust Rax, who served as her new advisor, she asked Rite to investigate his past as well as to catalog all ships in the Imperial service at the time of Emperor Sheev Palpatine. Rite was also tasked with writing a proposal for a new breeding program.[3]
            Unknown to Sloane, Rite was monitoring all of Sloane's activities and reporting them to Rax, her secret lover. Rite accompanied Sloane to the Liberation Day Peace Talks on Chandrila. As Sloane discovered that the intended peace initiative on Chandrila, orchestrated by Rax, was a ploy for using prisoners of war to attack Chancellor Mon Mothma and the Galactic Senate, she was furious and vowed to destroy Rax. Hearing this, Rite attempted to assassinate Sloane, who had realized that her own assistant betrayed her. Sloane shot Rite in the chest and fled the planet.[3]
            Adea Rite was a young Corellian human female who served in the Imperial Navy following the Battle of Endor. She served as a personal assistant to Admiral Sloane but longed to deepen her service to the Empire. She grew to respect Sloane for her selfless service and commitment to the Empire. Rite regarded the chaotic aftermath following Endor as an opportunity to advance her career in the Empire. As a staunch Imperial loyalist, Rite opposed the New Republic and sought to make a name for herself by recapturing the starfighter pilot Wedge Antilles. Despite her training in unarmed combat, she was defeated by Antilles.[1]
            While outwardly loyal and devoted to Admiral Sloane, Rite was a secret agent of Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, who had differences of opinion with Sloane on Imperial strategy and tactics. She had a romantic relationship with her secret benefactor and was loyal to him. Rite was even willing to kill her employer Admiral Sloane to prove her loyalty to Rax.[3]
            Adea Rite first appeared as a minor antagonist in Chuck Wendig's 2015 novel Aftermath. She also appeared in the novel's 2016 sequel Aftermath: Life Debt.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Adea_Rite</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAdeaRite</string></dict>

            Rabé and the other handmaidens were trained in self-defense and marksmanship. Their rigorous training was supervised by Amidala's head of security, Captain Panaka.[3] Rabé excelled with weapons and could also use more subtle forms of persuasion.[4]
            During one of the handmaidens' training sessions, Rabé was pursued and constantly shot at by a dysfunctional training droid. Hidden behind a waterfall, she was eventually saved by Amidala who destroyed the droid with a swift kick and helped Rabé get back to safety.[3]
            Rabé's primary duty as a handmaiden, other than bodyguard, was to prepare Queen Amidala's elaborate hairstyles. She also had a lot of patience and was often assigned to soothe Amidala's nerves.[5] Rabé was bilingual and was able to speak Sullustese.[4]

            Though the character's role in The Force Awakens was minimal, the 2016 video game LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens gave a more important role to Dasha Promenti during the attack on Tuanul sequence. There, she joins Poe Dameron and BB-8 in their–ultimately unsuccessful– escape attempt from Tuanul. Unlike her canon counterpart, she seemingly survives the First Order's attack by escaping to a safety location along with the youngest villagers of Tuanul.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dasha_Promenti</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDashaPromenti</string></dict>

After the Battle of Endor, she and other teenaged cadets were made junior officers even though they were too young. During the Battle of Jakku, the Inflictor took heavy damage and was boarded by New Republic forces, leading its captain Ciena Ree to order the ships self-destruct. Perrin raised her concern, but the captain assured her the crew would make it to the escape pods and be rescued by the nearest Imperial vessel. Perrin herself initiated the ship's self destruct, but discovered that the New Republic boarding party had disabled it. Realizing she couldn't let the Inflictor fall into New Republic hands, Captain Ree ordered Perrin and the rest of the crew to their escape pod, and turned the Star Destroyer towards Jakku, planning to scuttle the ship by crashing it into the planet's surface.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Perrin_(Ensign)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemPerrin</string></dict>
        <key>Chase Piru</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.251.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Chase Piru was a Human female Padawan of the Jedi Order who was stationed in the Jedi chapter house on Bogden 3 near the end of Clone Wars. When Order 66—an executive order declaring that all Jedi were traitors—was issued, she defended the Hawkbat Clan of younglings from the clone troopers that had come to Bogden for recovery, only to turn on the Jedi there upon receiving the order. Piru was able to escape alongside some younglings and Jedi Master K'Kruhk once Master Sian Jeisel sacrificed her life to allow their escape. After fleeing the system, the Jedi came to a moon, where they sought refuge from the Empire that had been declared by the former Galactic Republic's Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine.
            After two months spent in recovery on the moon, Piru and the younglings were assaulted by the pirate Lumbra and his crew, who had attempted to salvage parts for their starship from the Jedi's Theta-class shuttle. The Padawan was nearly killed trying to defend the younglings as they were taken captive by the pirates, who wished to claim the Galactic Empire's bounty for captured Jedi. K'Kruhk later found Piru and healed her before the two enacted their plan to rescue the Hawkbats. Lumbra himself was able to capture Piru, though, and threatened to kill her, causing K'Kruhk to unleash his uncontrolled rage on the pirates and finish them off. Afterward, K'Kruhk promised Piru that he would take her and the younglings to a safe place to live, away from the constant reminder of what they had witnessed on the moon. K'Kruhk fulfilled his promise by taking the younglings to the planet Arkinnea, but while Piru and K'Kruhk were joined by Jedi Master Zao, the group unintentionally discovered that the planet's militia were massacring refugees. The militia were stopped by the Empire, but Piru, Zao, and K'Kruhk established a Jedi refuge in a hidden valley with the help of the Yunu people, spending their lives in peace on Arkinnea.
            Chase Piru was a Human female Jedi Padawan stationed at the Jedi chapter house located on Bogden 3, a world in the Bogden system, during the Clone Wars. Along with Jedi Master Du Mahn, Piru looked after the Hawkbat Clan, a multi-species group of younglings that had been delayed in returning to the Jedi Temple of Coruscant due to the ongoing galactic conflict in 19 BBY. During the setback, the Whiphid Jedi Master K'Kruhk and Devaronian fellow Master Sian Jeisel also came to Bogden 3 seeking refuge, as they had been ambushed over the planet Saleucami after the siege on the Outer Rim world a couple of days earlier.[1]
            While K'Kruhk's and Jeisel's clone troopers attended to repairs on their damaged Theta-class shuttle, Piru cooked a meal for the party. Shortly after everyone consumed their meals, the group's clone captain and his men received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, which declared all Jedi to be traitors to the Galactic Republic. In compliance, the troopers opened fire on the Jedi, including the younglings. K'Kruhk, Du Mahn, Jeisel, and Piru all attempted to defend the group, but were forced to flee because of the troopers' overwhelming numbers. Du Mahn was killed in the initial attack and, as Piru and K'Kruhk led the younglings out to the shuttle, Jeisel sacrificed her life to hold back the clones, using a thermal detonator to kill them all. The Jedi then fled on the shuttle, clueless as to why the betrayal had occurred.[1]
            After fleeing from Bogden 3, K'Kruhk and Piru took the younglings to an uncharted moon. For two months, they were able to settle on the world and live in peace. K'Kruhk believed that on an unspoiled world such as the moon, the younglings could grow up happily and as Jedi. The Whiphid also noted that food would not be scarce, and that with their supplies, the Jedi could live in relative comfort on the moon for some years. Piru, meanwhile, cooked for the party and looked after the younglings alongside the Jedi Master. The two Jedi also successfully intercepted transmissions over the HoloNet which claimed that bounties had been placed on all Jedi across the galaxy, though both Piru and K'Kruhk believed the stories to be rumors.[3]
            One day as K'Kruhk hunted for game, a vessel entered the system and crash-landed near the Jedi crash site. Piru and the younglings believed the starship to be a rescue ship, but K'Kruhk tried to warn them otherwise, claiming there was no way to know who arrived on the vessel. However, the Whiphid's comlink was low on power and his communications were garbled, and the device eventually lost all its power. Piru was unable to receive his message to lead the younglings away from the camp, and therefore waited idly by.[4]
            Shortly after the starship landed on the moon, Lumbra the Gotal and his pirate crew, who needed to make repairs to their craft as a result of an onboard explosion, headed for the wreckage of the Jedi's shuttle in the hope of finding parts for their own ship. When they arrived, Lumbra promised nothing would happen to Piru or the younglings if they remained quiet. However, while the pirates scavenged for the drive unit on the Theta-class shuttle, the Twi'lek youngling Seddwia confronted Lumbra and demanded their vessel be left alone. Lumbra then grabbed the youngling by the arm and threatened her before Piru attempted to free her. Although she was able to Force-push one pirate away, Piru was shot by Callow, Lumbra's right-hand man, before she could strike the Gotal. Kennan Taanzer, another youngling, then attempted to aid Piru, but was quickly knocked down by Callow. In response, Lumbra took the younglings captive, hoping to obtain the bounty placed on the Jedi by the First Galactic Empire. Presumed dead, Piru was left behind.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chase_Piru</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemChasePiru</string></dict>
        <key>Shadday Potkin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.252.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shadday Potkin was a female Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General during the Clone Wars. She would survive the war and the dissolution of the Order, only to be executed by Darth Vader in the following months.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Shadday Potkin was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. Attaining the rank of Jedi Master, Potkin had constructed a lightsaber to wield during her services to the Order. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Master Potkin took up the rank of General in the Grand Army of the Republic and began sitting in on strategy reports at the Coruscant Jedi Temple.[2]
            When the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, Palpatine issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army, the clone troopers dutifully turned their blasters on the Jedi leaders. Potkin managed to evade execution and returned to Coruscant where she saw the Temple in ruins and her Jedi comrades slain. While on the capital world, Master Potkin discovered that Palpatine, the man who ordered the dissolution of the Order and the new Galactic Emperor, was indeed the Dark Lord of the Sith the Order had been hunting.[3]
            Leaving Coruscant and going to ground, Master Potkin concocted a scheme to entrap Palpatine's Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. Calling a conclave on the planet Kessel, Master Potkin's meeting would be held in an abandoned spice mine. As her peers showed up under the pretense that they would discuss the future of the Order, it became quite clear to all that Master Potkin was actually manipulating them for her own obsessive purpose. As her target, Darth Vader, stormed the complex and headed to Potkin's planned ambush, the other Jedi ignited their lightsabers in preparation of the surprise attack.[1]
            Numbering eight, Potkin and her allies attacked Vader. Armed with a rare cortosis blade, Potkin was able to deactivate the Sith Lord's crimson-bladed weapon after he cut down Jedi Sia-Lan Wezz. Believing that she had the upper hand, Potkin's victory was quickly cut short when Vader simply grabbed her by the neck and snapped the woman's spine. Caught up in Potkin's plan, all six of the other Jedi present were killed.[1]
            Potkin was an extremely arrogant woman, believing that she and other fellow Jedi would be able to conquer Vader despite the fact that he had already killed more Jedi by himself. In addition, she was naïve and self-absorbed enough to discount the fact that Vader was extremely powerful in the Force as well as the fact that he had far superior strength, leading to her death in her pride.
            Her name is from the designers of Dressing a Galaxy; Namely Usana Shadday and Noah Potkin.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shadday_Potkin/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemShaddayPotkin</string></dict>
        <key>Paige Tico</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.253.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Paige Tico, nicknamed Pae-Pae by her sister, was a human female who served as a gunner on a MG-100 StarFortress SF-17 in the Resistance during their conflict with the First Order. She was the sister of Rose Tico, a Resistance maintenance worker. During the evacuation of the Resistance base on D'Qar, Tico's bomber flew against the First Order Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix and successfully destroyed it with the bomber's payload. However, the resulting explosion engulfed the bomber and took Tico's life. Her final actions allowed the Resistance's fleet to escape D'Qar's system.
            Paige Tico had at least one sibling, a younger sister named Rose Tico. After witnessing firsthand the brutality of the First Order on their homeworld in the Otomok system, both Paige and Rose fled from the Otomok system and joined the Resistance.[6]
            As a Resistance soldier, Paige became an exceptional gunner and pilot. She survived several missions, leading her to became superstitious, occasionally wrapping her medallion around the struts of her cannons for good luck. Though Rose was a maintenance worker aboard the cruiser Raddus, she sometimes accompanied Paige on flights. During their downtime between bombing runs, the two sisters always discussed their chance to see the galaxy.[7]
            In 34 ABY,[3] during the evacuation of D'Qar, Paige's bomber, the Cobalt Hammer, flew against the First Order's Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix, commanded by Captain Moden Canady. When Paige was ordered to release the proton bombs of her bomber, she hurriedly climbed out of her bomber's hold to the bombardier station, where she took the control to release the bombs, but the laser cannon of a First Order TIE Fighter hit the Hammer, causing her to fall off the ladder and lose consciousness.[4]
            When Paige regained consciousness, she discovered that the Resistance was in trouble. Unfortunately, the control to release the proton bombs had been left at the top of the ladder. Knowing that she would not have enough time to get back into the cockpit and activate the bombs with the control, Paige kicked the ladder so that the control could fall into her hands. After several kicks, the control fell into the abyss, but Paige managed to catch it. Then, Paige released the proton bombs, which fell on the Fulminatrix, destroying the ship and killing Captain Canady and his crew.[4] As it was too late for escape and knowing her sacrifice would keep the Resistance safe,[8] Paige closed her eyes and accepted her death, as the fire engulfed the Hammer.[4]
            Eventually, Paige's sacrifice allowed the Resistance's fleet to escape D'Qar's system for good, although the First Order would eventually follow them.[4] Paige's sister, Rose, took her death very hard. Writing a brief epitaph at the end of the journal Paige had kept, Rose described her part in the battle, commending her older sister as having died a hero and swearing that she wouldn't let the First Order destroy the Resistance and would find a way to defeat them.[2]
            When Rose saw Finn trying to "escape" from the Raddus, she stunned him and attempted to bring him to the Resistance as a coward because her sister was killed during the battle, but she was ultimately convinced that Finn was not trying to escape.[4]
            Paige was extremely close to her younger sister, Rose, since childhood, feeling incomplete when they were separated. When they joined the Resistance, Paige insisted that she and Rose be assigned to the same ship.[2] The two sisters frequently sat together at Paige's gunner station while traveling to and from missions.[1] Paige thought that Rose underestimated herself and her importance in the Resistance[2] and often provided moral support.[2]
            While Paige hated the First Order's leadership for the destruction of her homeworld and their other atrocities, she didn't hold the same vitriol for the First Order soldiers and pilots. She felt that many of them were people like her, thrown into a situation that some would have wanted to escape, a belief she found vindicated by the stormtrooper Finn, who defected from the First Order and helped the Resistance destroy Starkiller Base.[2]
            Paige had a fascination for fathiers, deciding that they were the one creature above all else she wanted to see in person.[2] On her suggestion, the crew of the Hammer used imaginary stables of fathiers as markers in the crew's card games.[1] Paige also wanted to see a live fathier race.[2] While she never got to see a fathier or a race, her sister Rose got to see and ride one on her mission with Finn to Canto Bight.[4]
            Paige Tico was portrayed by Vietnamese actress Veronica Ngo in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.[4] Tico was first shown in the Behind The Scenes video for The Last Jedi, which was released on July 15, 2017 for the D23 Expo. Director Rian Johnson confirmed Paige's appearance in the footage on Twitter.[9]
            In one of the film's early drafts, featuring a different version of the evacuation of D'Qar, Paige was going to die after releasing the proton bombs over the Fulminatrix in the arms of Finn, who would have been the gunner of the Cobalt Hammer instead of being hospitalized aboard the Raddus. Concept art for the planned scene showed Paige's last moments in which she would have left a bloody hand print on Finn's heart, echoing the stormtrooper's bloody handprint scene of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, including how Finn pulled her lifeless body from the bomber inside the Resistance hangar, but director Rian Johnson cut the scene in a later revision of the script, because he ultimately found that "he couldn't pay it off."[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Paige_Tico</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemPaigeTico</string></dict>

            In 3643 BBY, she was sent to the desert-planet, Tatooine to find the holocron of a long-dead Sith Lord named Darth Nihilus. However, she had to face against Vaverone Zare, a servant of the Empire, who was also looking for the holocron. She was present inside Tookreek's cantina when she was forced to engage Chomm and his gang that were giving her trouble. Before engaging, a smuggler who had entered the cantina to talk with Tookreek took notice and warned the gang to leave her alone. Nariel swiftly slew all her attackers. She then exchanged formal introductions with the smuggler, she attempted to encourage them to change their ways and stop associating with criminals, before departing.
            Nariel later investigated an Imperial assault on Diago Hixan's summer palace and was surprised to find the smuggler involved in the fighting. The smuggler explained that the Imperials were sent by Zare, who attempting to broker a meeting with Diago, who possessed the holocron. The smuggler gave Nariel the location of Diago's hideout, the Lightspring. After expressing her thanks, the Jedi advised the smuggler not to follow, but the smuggler ignored her advice and did so anyway.
            Once all parties arrived at the Lightspring, tension began to grow before both Zare and Nariel attempted to use a mind trick to compel the smuggler to fight for her or drop their weapons respectively, but the smuggler proved too strong willed to be manipulated. Diago then ordered his droids to kill everyone. Nariel and the smuggler fought side-by-side against both Diago and Zare, killing them both.
            Nariel Pridence is voiced by Grey DeLisle.
            If the Smuggler character is male, he can flirt with Nariel, making her wish that if she wasn't a Jedi, she'd have known what to do in romantic situations.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nariel_Pridence</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemNarielPridence</string></dict>
        <key>Mako  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.256.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mako was a Human female who lived during the Cold War. She was discovered by Braden on the moon Nar Shaddaa, and was hired by him to provide intel and tech for those participating in the Great Hunt.[2]
            By the age of 7, Mako was an orphan living on Nar Shaddaa and already had earned a reputation for having an unnatural affiliation to all things computer related, including slicing. Her skills were such that she managed to teach herself every known programming language, and at the age of eight, managed to crash the bank account of a red light district orphanage in which she lived, which had attempted to sell her. After escaping the orphanage with a large amount of credits from their account, she found herself working with several of Nar Shaddaa's most notorious slicer gangs. 7 years after her escape, at the age of 15, several of Mako's friends disastrously messed up a job given to them by a Hutt Cartel. Mako was in some way partially blamed for the incident and ended up wounded in an alley where she was found by a bounty hunter named Braden. Braden required a tech specialist for his crew and offered her the job, which she accepted, wanting to leave the moon and let the failed job fade from the Hutt's memories. She soon came to see Braden's crew as her first real family and grew to love the code of honor and underground culture of the bounty hunting world. For a short time, the Trandoshan hunter Qyzen Fess was a bounty hunter who worked for Braden and Mako.
            In 3643 BBY, Braden had recruited an impressive crew, composed of himself, Mako, a Kadas'sa'Nikto named Jory, and an talented new protege, to compete in the Great Hunt, a competition held for hunters across the galaxy. But while the Hunter and Mako were out, they returned to discover Braden and Jory murdered. Mako first assumed that the Hunter was the one responsible, but realized that it couldn't be true. Reviewing her holorecordings, they discovered that the perpetrator was Tarro Blood, a cunning Mandalorian who allowed an accomplice to murder Mako's adopted family.
            Without Braden to negotiate Suudaa Nem'ro the Hutt for Great Hunt sponsorship, Mako had to call in every favor to get her partner into the Great Hunt. They managed to succeed, though they suffered constant interference from Blood.
            Throughout their travels together, Mako began wondering about her cranial implant and her family. Eventually, she learned that someone named Carteri was poking around Nar Shaddaa asking about her. Confronting the man, Mako learned that she had an identical sister named Coral, on the Republic SIS watch list. Carteri presented Mako a datapad which was lined with encryption that was hard for her to crack. Searching from SIS databases, Mako learned that Carteri didn't exist in them and found something about "Project 32". Eventually, she managed to contact Coral, who insisted that an SIS agent named Izak was after her, but wouldn't say why. She sent Mako and her partner to Dromund Kaas, where Mako encountered more identical sisters, who continued to mistake her for Coral.
            Mako finally cracked the information on the datapad to allow her to call Izak and trick him into giving away Coral's location on Nar Shaddaa. Confronting Coral, Mako was shocked to hear her own sister calling her a cheap copy. Subduing Coral, Mako chose to hand her over to Izak.
            During the Hunter's travels in Rishi, the two were contacted by Thera Markon, daughter of Crysta Markon, their handler during the Great Hunt. Thera told them that Crysta was killed by the Kanawyn Syndicate and was issuing a bounty on them. After taking care of the Syndicate, Thera expressed to the group a desire to use their influence with the Empire to expand her smuggling business to Dromund Kaas, something Mako had mixed feelings towards since it involves betraying their primary clients.
            During the Eternal Empire's Conquest, the hunter went missing. Sometime afterward, Mako quit bounty hunting, blaming it for the reason she loses everyone she cares about. After the majority of the group left, she hunted with Torian until Mandalore summoned the clans. She was then left on Carratos.
            Eventually Mako would Team up with Mandalorian Mercenary and former Companion to The Voidhound, Akaavi Spar, becoming a bounty hunting duo.
            Growing up as an orphan on Nar Shaddaa, Mako was tougher then she appeared, savvy of the underworld, and very much aware of its dangers. Mako had an intense interest in bounty hunting, loving the code of honor some hunters used and its underworld culture.
            Mako was in no way unaware of the dangers and hard truths of bounty hunting such as kidnapping and killing, but accepted them as a necessity of the job. She approved of bounty hunters having a code of honor, such as defending the weak, and avoiding killing when it was possible, such as capturing a target alive. Despite accepting killing as a necessity of hunting, Mako strongly disapproved of killing when other options were available, especially when they were innocent, and had no means of defending themselves, or when the killer took pleasure from it. Despite this, Mako did not object to a hunter killing someone if they asked to die, or if she thought they deserved it.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mako_(slicer)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMako</string></dict>

She served in Civil Government of the Alliance to Restore the Republic as the Minister of Education and worked closely with Alliance Intelligence. She feared that an attack against the Galactic Empire and its planet-destroying Death Star would put Taris in mortal danger.
            Tynnra Pamlo hailed from the planet Taris, which she represented as a member of the Imperial Senate during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Though a member of the Senate, she was also a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and served as the Minister of Education in its Civil Government. In that capacity, she worked closely with Alliance Intelligence and received many reports about atrocities carried out by the Empire, including the Siege of Lasan, the sterilization of Geonosis, and actions on Ghorman.[1]
            When the Alliance learned of the existence of the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon capable of destroying entire planets, Pamlo had no doubt of its existence but was wary of launching an attack against it. She wanted to consult with her people about it,[1] and feared that the Alliance had no chance against such power.[2] She also worried that an attack against the Empire would put her homeworld in danger of being destroyed.[1] Shortly after the meeting on Yavin 4, Pamlo traveled back to Coruscant to publicly decry the Imperial battle station before resigning her office.[3]

A native of the planet Dandoran, Pava was born in a time when the New Republic governed the galaxy, restoring democracy after decades of totalitarian rule by the Galactic Empire. Raised on the legends of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, Pava was a great admirer of the Jedi who defeated Emperor Palpatine and became known as the best star pilot in galactic history.
            Following in her idol's example, Pava became a pilot in the New Republic Defense Fleet. However, in lieu of the Galactic Senate's unwillingness to punish the First Order's violations of the peace treaty that ended the Galactic Civil War, Pava chose to support General Leia Organa's organization as a Resistance pilot during the cold war. Serving as a member of Blue Squadron and Black Squadron, in turn, she piloted the T-70 X-wing starfighter under the command of Commander Poe Dameron.
            Pava served with distinction during her time in the Resistance, although the group's astromech units took note of her record for losing droids while on missions for the Resistance. In the aftermath of the Hosnian Cataclysm in 34 ABY, Pava's squadron deployed to Starkiller Base in an attempt to destroy the superweapon before it could destroy the Resistance base along with the entire planet of D'Qar. Their mission was ultimately a success, resulting in the base's destruction and the survival of the Resistance.
            Jessika Pava was a human female[2] from Dandoran.[1]
            At one point, she and her family were captured by pirates and imprisoned. This led her to want to be in control and her hatred of being chained up later in life.[7]
            Pava became a member of the Resistance during its conflict with the First Order,[2] approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor.[8] She flew as a T-70 X-wing starfighter pilot in Blue Squadron, operating under the callsign of Blue Three. She was an admirer of Luke Skywalker, the famed Jedi Knight who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, and had heard stories of his time in the Rebellion, such as when he destroyed the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin.[2]
            While performing a maintenance assignment while serving at a Resistance base, Pava met C-3PO, a protocol droid who had been in the service of Skywalker and the Rebellion during the Galactic Civil War. Upon realizing that Threepio knew Skywalker, she asked him to tell her a story about Skywalker's adventures during the war. Threepio regaled her with a story of Skywalker's time on Devaron after the Battle of Yavin, where he trained in the Jedi Temple of Eedit. Her time talking to Threepio was cut short, once Pava was called to a meeting in the Resistance command center.[2]
            As a friend of Captain Poe Dameron and a member of Black Squadron, Pava was handpicked by Dameron for a secret quest to find the explorer Lor San Tekka. General Leia Organa had tasked Dameron with finding Lor San Tekka in the hope of finding her lost brother Luke. Pava was also accompanied by the Galactic Civil War veterans L'ulo L'ampar and Temmin Wexley ("Snap"), and the pilot Karé Kun. Prior to departing, Pava told Dameron that she had to delay her repairs to her T-70 X-wing starfighter and asked about the details of their mission. Dameron apologized that their mission was classified for now.[6]
            For their first mission, Pava and her team traveled to the mountainous world of Ovanis. Ovanis was home to a cult called the Crèche, who were believed to have encountered San Tekka. While Dameron and BB-8 flew their X-wing into the Cave of the Crèche to question the Crèche cultists, Pava and her fellow pilots circled the skies. After initiating contact with the Crèche, Dameron contacted L'ulo to warn them that he had found a tracker on his starfighter. Kun then reported the presence of a First Order platform and other forces hovering above the Cave of the Crèche.[6]
            Following the arrival of First Order forces, Pava asked her fellow pilots what Dameron had meant by his order "get me some leverage." At L'ulo and Kun's recommendation, the pilots decided to figure it out for themselves. Wexley advocated seizing the First Order platform so that they could land and refuel their starfighters. Pava then proposed getting rid of the TIE/fo space superiority fighters so that they could land. She believed that the ground forces on the platform would surrender right away. L'ulo then used his A-wing to strafe the TIE fighters but was unable to destroy them all. The surviving TIE fighters engaged Black Squadron in a dogfight.[9]
            However, the First Order commander Agent Terex had kept back the Maxima-A class heavy cruiser Ravenous and its TIE fighter complement in reserve. Black Squadron soon found itself pursued by several TIE fighters.[9] Outnumbered and outgunned, Pava remarked that they had to get out of the line of fire. When L'ulo recommended buying them time for Dameron, Wexley ordered his pilots to split up and head into the canyons in an attempt to disperse their pursuers. Pava found herself pursued by three TIE fighters but managed to lose them by collapsing a ridge on top of them. However, her astromech droid was hit by two other TIE fighters. At Wexley's recommendation, Pava and her fellow pilots launched a head-on attack on the TIE fighters.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jessika_Pava</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJessikaPava</string></dict>
        <key>Jan Ors</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.260.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jan Ors was a Human female Alderaanian intelligence operative who began her work as an agent for the terrorist organization Justice Action Network. As the undercover agent Jan Strange, she then shifted to helping the Alliance to Restore the Republic, becoming one of their trusted operatives.
            Ors was instrumental in recruiting Kyle Katarn to the Alliance and together they worked on many missions for the Alliance and later the New Republic. The two would later become romantically involved. Ors continued her work for the New Republic by joining Alpha Blue, a secret intelligence organization, that she eventually took over from Hiram Drayson. There she worked for the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances against the Yuuzhan Vong.
            Jan Ors' mother was a choreographer for Alderaan's premier ballet company, and her father was an aerospace engineer; Ors learned both of these arts.[6] Her parents also were instrumental in Earnst Kamiel's establishing of the Justice Action Network, an anti-Imperial terrorist organization whose initials (JAN) were partly chosen to honor the Ors' daughter. However, Ors did not stay with the JAN, instead striking out on her own path.[1]
            She began her career by infiltrating Imperial Intelligence under the pseudonym Jan Strange.[1] Once she was well placed in the Surveillance section of Intell, she contacted the Alliance Intelligence, providing them with invaluable counterintelligence and performing sabotage and covert extractions.[1][9] She first encountered the Imperial cadet Kyle Katarn while working in Intell, though neither left an impression on the other at the time.[1]
            She maintained a very delicate balance of providing intelligence to the Alliance while simultaneously performing her duties as an Imperial Intelligence officer. Surveillance section came to value her ability to pinpoint the right subjects for observation, and often sent her to the Core Worlds where corruption was rampant. This "talent" was the result of Ors arranging to have targets planted by the Alliance, whom she would then observe, capture, and interrogate; they would then be set free, and she would fake a "termination during interrogation" to cover their escape.[9]
            Unfortunately for the Alliance, her cover required her to sometimes act against them, even sometimes going so far as to sacrifice clumsy and careless agents. Despite having never worn the uniform of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, her difficult assignment earned her a Captain's rank and a Nebula for Bravery in absentia, along with an almost legendary stature among other Rebels.[9]
            Ors did not remain in her Jan Strange guise for long, and was soon performing missions as part of the Rebel Alliance itself. In 1 BBY, she participated in a mission to steal prime-grade fuel slugs from Imperial forces in the jungles of Oulanne. In the course of the mission, her leg was injured, and it became infected. Her teammates fled with her to Pellezara station in the Duro system, where they hid her beneath the deckplates of their freighter while they all disembarked in search of medical supplies. Tarrin Datch, a seventeen-year old son of the owners of the station, found her while replacing the ship's gravity disks during routine restocking. In a delirium brought on by the strange alien infection, Ors told the boy her name and the cargo the ship was carrying.[10]
            When Imperial forces entered the Duro system, Datch, an accomplished pilot, took action to save the strikingly beautiful woman, undocking the ship, and proceeding to fly it in a manner more befitting a starfighter than a freighter, outmaneuvering the Gamma-class assault shuttle that was pursuing them. When he made it to open space, he hypered to an outer-system station that was equipped with a well-equipped medicenter, where he stabilized Ors. Unable to return to Pellezara station, and knowing the fuel slugs needed to be delivered to the Alliance, Ors disclosed the location of the Dantooine base to Datch, who took them both there. There, Datch joined the Rebellion and began training to become a fighter pilot,[11] while Ors went on to other missions;[10] one of them stationed her at a Rebel base on the asteroid AX-456.[6]
            It was not long before the Empire located the AX-456 base and invaded; coincidentally, Kyle Katarn was the cadet commander in charge of the mission. At one point, Ors and Katarn saw each other, and though neither remembered their brief past encounters, both felt a spark of distant recognition. Katarn spared the lives of the Rebel group she was in, which fled the asteroid.[6]
            It would not be their last encounter. During a mission aboard the Star of Empire, Ors again encountered Katarn, to whom she revealed that it was the Empire, not Rebels, who killed his father Morgan Katarn. She established a relationship with the already ambivalent Katarn, and when spies uncovered the presence of Rebels aboard the Star, he defected with Ors.[6]
            Sometime between her service as Jan Strange and the mission to Danuta, Ors lost the use of her right hand and had it replaced with a cybernetic prosthesis.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jan_Ors</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJanOrs</string></dict>

Fair-skinned with orange hair and a green triangle tattoo on his forehead, he and his wife were of Dathomiri descent, and had a daughter named Shae Koda sometime before the year 25,805 BBY, when the Twi'lek Despot Queen Hadiya attempted to conquer the Tython system in the Despot War. Shae Koda's father and mother fought the Despot Army on Tython, but both were killed by Hadiya personally at the gates of Kaleth, the Temple of Knowledge. Though the Despot War ended with a Je'daii victory, Shae Koda grew up an orphan and resented her parents for abandoning her. In 25,793 BBY, while in the Rift—a ravine on Tython saturated with the dark side—Koda encountered visions of her parents and attacked them in rage.[1] In 25,792 BBY, Koda's parents appeared in a vision to her in the depths of the Chasm on Tython.[2]
            Shae Koda's father was first mentioned in Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi 0, a prequel issue for the comic book series Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi, and he first appeared in a vision in the 2012 comic book Dawn of the Jedi: Force Storm 4;[1] her parents were also mentioned in the sixth issue of the series.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shae_Koda%27s_father</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemShaeKoda'sfather</string></dict>

            A member of House Organa, Tia Organa grew up on Alderaan with her brother and sisters. Several years before the Clone Wars began, Organa was set to marry a nobleman of House Vandron. Despite this, Organa had begun having an affair with her brother Prestor Organa's friend and companion, Halagad Ventor. During the affair, Organa joined her brother and Ventor on a manka cat hunting expedition at the Okonomo Retreat when the mad geneticist Zeta Magnus infiltrated the Retreat building and infected all of the revelers, including Ventor's parents, with a hive virus. Driven mad by the virus, the partygoers were held under a cannibalistic sway and began a mad frenzy of devouring each other before ultimately being consumed by Magnus. When the hunting party received word of the tragedy, Ventor abandoned Organa and left her pregnant and alone. The scandal rocked the political world in Aldera City, and the alliance between House Organa and House Vandron came to an end. She later gave birth to a son, whom she named Nial Organa.[4]
            Organa had a number of pittins whom she spoiled, treating them like they were her own children. They included All-Terrain Attack Vehicle, Taffy, Winkie, and Fluffy.
            Tia Organa was present on Alderaan in 0 BBY when Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin ordered the destruction of the planet. When the Death Star fired on Alderaan and destroyed it within seconds, Organa perished along with her son and all other Alderaanians present on the world.

        <key>Rouge Organa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.263.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rouge Organa was a female Human who was a member of the Organa family of Alderaan and the sister of Bail, Celly and Tia Organa, as well as the adopted aunt of Leia Organa. A strict dowager, Rouge helped her brother raise the young Leia by inculcating her with the codes and protocol of high court life. In 0 BBY, Rouge Organa died in the destruction of Alderaan.
            A Human female, Rouge Organa was born in the last decades of the Galactic Republic on Alderaan,[1] a planet of pristine beauty that had been and a center of culture and education for many a century.[5] From birth, she was destined for a glamorous life, as the blood of the most noble and wealthy House Organa coursed through her veins. She was the daughter of the Viceroy Organa and one of four siblings, the others being Tia, Celly and Bail Prestor.[1] When she finished school and came of age, Rouge was brought to a debutante ball on Coruscant, capital city of the Republic. By custom, young noblewomen attended levees in hopes they could find a suitable husband of high lineage.[6] Eventually, Rouge Organa got married and started a family of her own.[7] In the meantime, her brother Bail Prestor Organa went on to become the Viceroy and First Chairman of the Alderaan system and the husband of Queen Breha Antilles.[8]
            Following the end of the Clone Wars, a three-year galaxy-wide conflict, Rouge's brother adopted the late Senator Padmé Amidala's daughter, a baby called Leia.[9] Rouge Organa and her two sisters, Tia and Celly, helped their brother raise his adopted child, moving to the Royal Palace of Aldera.[4] By the time Leia was an infant, Rouge Organa had become a widow.[1]
            Rouge and her sisters hired deportment teachers to tutor young Leia, wishing to make a "proper" princess out of their tombyish niece,[1] including the redoubtable Madame Vesta, headmistress of Alderaan Select Academy for Young Ladies. The Organa sisters would often tend to the Princess' dress and hair themselves, much to Leia's annoyance.[4] In 1 BBY, Rouge accompanied Leia Organa, now a young adult and a Senator, to a levee on Coruscant along with her siblings. When her niece noticed the Galactic Emperor Palpatine's jeweled concubines and asked her about them, Rouge assumed a superior air and answered that a Princess was not obligated to speak with their sort.[1]
            One year later, the Galactic Empire decided to subject all Alderaanians to a radical punishment, following their Viceroy's involvement with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Imperial Grand Moff Tarkin decided to use his new superweapon, the Death Star, to sow the seeds of terror and keep the seditious star systems in line. The peaceful planet Alderaan vanished with a single green blast from the Death Star's superlaser, with the captive Princess Leia watching in horror.[10] Although her aunts had made her girlhood tough and sometimes unpleasant, Leia Organa was immediately struck with grief when she realized they were gone forever.[3] Many years later, the Princess, now the Chief of State of a New Republic, would often remember her Aunt Rouge.[1]
            Rouge Organa was a fair-skinned Human female who sported long hair that she kept bound,[4] as was customary among Alderaanian adults,[11] and would adorn them with flowers.[4] In the evening, before dinner, she enjoyed having servants tending to her hair in front of a gilt-framed mirror in her boudoir.[1] A refined woman born into wealth, Rouge Organa enjoyed wearing iridescent Old Republic bronze earrings, a taste she shared with her sisters. By contrast, she despised semi-dry wines, considering them unrefined and only good enough for space-hoppers.[1] A gossipy[12] and proud noblewoman, she overtly despised Palpatine's Imperial concubines.[1] Rouge Organa valued patience, and she tried to inculcate this virtue into her niece.[3] The dowager attached great importance to etiquette, and she would not hesitate to lecture other people of high-rank about their offspring's public behavior.[1] She also had a very strict idea of the proper dress code for a self-respecting woman.[1]
            Princess Leia's three dowager aunts were first mentioned in Children of the Jedi, is a 1995 novel written by Barbara Hambly. More specifically, Rouge Organa was mentioned by name eleven times throughout the novel, which is twice as much as Celly and more than thrice as much as Tia.[1] Although Rouge, Tia and Celly Organa were created in the absence of a mother figure for the young Leia, early sources such as Star Wars 53: The Last Gift From Alderaan! suggest that a woman whom Leia called "mother" survived until the destruction of Alderaan.[13]
            In 1998, Rouge Organa received a passing mention in Jude Watson's Star Wars Journal: Captive to Evil, a retelling of the events of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope from Princess Leia's point of view.[3]
            In "The Princess Leia Diaries", a short comic written by Jason Hall that appeared in Star Wars Tales 11, Bail Organa's three sisters were pictured for the first time. However, Rouge Organa has not been clearly identified with any of the three aunts from the comic.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rouge_Organa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRougeOrgana</string></dict>

        <key>Breha Organa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.265.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Breha Organa, born Breha Antilles, was a female Human who was the Queen and Minister of Education of Alderaan at the time of the Galactic Empire's formation. She was the wife of Prince Bail Organa, Viceroy and First Chairman of the Alderaan system. The couple longed for a child for many years, but Queen Breha suffered multiple miscarriages that put her own life at risk. Eventually, the Organas adopted the baby girl of the late Senator Amidala after the end of the Clone Wars. The couple raised the girl as their own daughter, the Princess Leia Organa. In the early days of the Galactic Empire, the Queen's family helped to build a rebellion against that Authoritarian Dictatorship. Breha Organa later perished when the Empire destroyed[9] Alderaan by blowing it up and turned the planet into an asteroid field with the superlaser of the Death Star battlestation. Years after her passing, she was remembered as a loving mother, and a simple mention of her would still awaken a sense of patriotism in the surviving Alderaanians.
            Breha Antilles was born on Alderaan, one of the founding planets of the Galactic Republic[7] at some point between 59 and 49 BBY,[2] under the chancellorship of either Thoris Darus or Frix.[10] A Human female of noble lineage, she was a member of the House of Antilles, one of Alderaan's most influential families.[7] She had at least one sister, Deara Antilles, who looked much like her, although with a round face and a taller stature.[11] She had a cousin, with whom she grew up and whom she considered a brother.[12] She was also related to both Prince Bail Antilles[13] and Captain Raymus Antilles, who was later entrusted with piloting the private vessel of the House of Organa,[14] the Sundered Heart.[15]
            After the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention, Breha married Prince Bail Prestor Organa, and she took the mantle of Queen of Alderaan at some point before 22 BBY. During Queen Breha's wedding, the famous Alderaanian scientist Tryn Netzl acted as her groom's witness.[16] Breha Organa also enlisted her sister, making her a royal advisor.[11] Beyond her royal role, Queen Breha also served as her planet's Minister of Education.[7]
            Following the election of Senator Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic[17] in 32 BBY,[3] Bail Organa acted as Senator of the Alderaan sector to the Galactic Senate. With her husband—whom she affectionately called "B"—serving on Coruscant,[12] Queen Breha often spent days alone in her palace in the mountains over the capital of Aldera. An influential and busy man, Senator Organa could rarely afford long trips to his home planet. Over the same period, Breha Organa befriended Padmé Amidala, Senator and former Queen of the Mid Rim planet Naboo.[18] The two women had many things in common, having both ruled their respective homeworlds,[1][19] both of which were peaceful planets with pristine landscapes and a focus on art and philosophy.[20][21] When the Clone Wars broke out in 22 BBY, Bail Organa became even more engaged in the ongoing political turmoil, and Breha would only receive lightning visits from him.[18]
            Over the years, Breha and her husband had many difficulties in producing a child and heir. The Queen had suffered at least five miscarriages, despite receiving treatment from the best fertility doctors in the Galactic Republic.[16] After the last miscarriage in 21 BBY, her doctors informed her that another attempt to conceive would probably kill her.[22] The Queen's husband suffered tremendously as a result of the repeated mournings, and he often attempted to drown his sorrows in alcohol under the benevolent surveillance of his friend Tryn Netzl.[16]
            That same year, the Queen's brotherly cousin, who served as a tactical officer in the Republic Navy, was killed in the destruction of his ship Bespin Dancer during a battle over Falleen. Arguing that his wife should be informed by him personally and not by an impersonal communiqué, Bail Organa broke protocol and told Queen Breha about the demise of her kinsman. Upon hearing the news, the Queen of Alderaan reacted with deep, if muted, sorrow.[12]
            In 19 BBY, the fury of the Clone Wars ended. The three-year long conflict had left very deep wounds all over the galaxy, but the hardest part was yet to come. Chancellor Palpatine, who was in fact a powerful Sith Lord known as Darth Sidious, dismantled the Republic and replaced it with his despotic Galactic Empire. The Senator Amidala, who had been Queen Breha's friend, was among the indirect fatalities of the regime change, leaving behind her newborn twins: a boy named Luke and a girl named Leia. In reality, those children had been fathered by Anakin Skywalker, a famed Jedi Knight who had turned to the dark side. Unbeknownst to most people in the galactic community, Skywalker became the right-hand man of the Emperor Palpatine, wearing the name and heavy armor of Darth Vader.[1]
            With the blessing and sanction of the Jedi Master Yoda, Queen Breha Organa and her husband then took Leia in, committed to loving her as their own child. Through adoption, Amidala's baby girl became Leia Organa, Princess of Alderaan.[1] Soon thereafter, when Bail's former senatorial aide Sheltay Retrac and her husband died, Breha and Bail also adopted their orphaned daughter, the infant Winter.[7] The couple raised both girls together, although Winter was not considered royalty.[23] A third foster child, the young Neena, was also raised in the Organa household.[24] The new parents relied on Prince Bail's sisters Rouge, Tia, and Celly Organa to assist them in their parental work.[25]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Breha_Organa/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBrehaOrgana</string></dict>
        <key>Mazicia Organa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.266.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mazicia Organa was a female Human who served as the Queen of the planet Alderaan during the period leading up to the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict. She was also the mother of Bail Prestor Organa, who became the last Viceroy and First Chairman of the Alderaan system. In 38 BBY, the life of Mazicia Organa was shattered when her youngest brother, the agricultural specialist Tayvor Mandirly, was murdered on a moon known as Antar 4. The famous blockade runner CR90 corvette later known as the Tantive IV was built during her reign, under the name Star of Alderaan. Despite the time that had gone by since Mandirly's passing, the mourning Queen was never able to resume a normal life. At some point before the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, the Queen's sorrow was such that she died of grief.
            A Human[4] female, Mazicia Organa came from Alderaan,[1] a pristine planet of refined culture,[6] in the waning decades of the Galactic Republic.[1] She was one of several children, the youngest of which became the renowned agricultural expert Tayvor Mandirly.[7] Later in life, Mazicia joined the House of Organa,[8] one of the galaxy's most respected Ancient Houses,[9] by marrying the Viceroy Organa.[10] Eventually, Mazicia Organa was crowned Queen of Alderaan.[1] In the year 67 BBY,[11] she gave birth to a baby boy, the Prince Bail Prestor Organa.[12] Together, the Queen and the Viceroy Organa became dedicated and loving parents, but they never spoiled their son, even though his patrician education came with many privileges.[7]
            In 38 BBY,[3] Mazicia's brother Tayvor was murdered on the moon Antar 4 by Raxis and Nolid, two members of a local criminal organization, during a colfillini plantation dispute on the planet. Mandirly's charred body was found nailed to a stake by the Jedi apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi. That traumatic event was devastating for the Queen of Alderaan, and from then on, sorrow began to take over her life.[7]
            Sometime before 33 BBY,[13] the Queen ordered the construction of the Star of Alderaan, a Corellian CR90 corvette the use of which was reserved to Senator Agrippa Aldrete,[1] who represented the Alderaan sector in the Galactic Senate.[14] Organa allowed the ship to serve the House of Alderaan without granting it the status of royal vessel so that it could have additional defensive systems and weapons added, predicting that her family might someday need more protection in dangerous situations.[1] As years went by, Mazicia never managed to get over her brother's death, which eventually led to her own demise. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Separatist Confederacy in 22 BBY, Queen Mazicia Organa had been dead for some time, and the throne had been passed to Breha Antilles, who was the wife of Bail Organa.[7]
            Long after Queen Mazicia's death, her memory was still vivid in the mind of her son. At the start of the Clone Wars, Bail Organa was still deeply resentful against Raxis and Nolid, believing they should have been executed for provoking his mother's passing.[7] House Organa also continued to use the Star of Alderaan, later renamed the Tantive IV, for over three decades,[12] and their involvement in the Rebellion against the newly formed Galactic Empire[15] proved Mazicia's prediction that her family might need more protection.[1]
            The Queen of Alderaan Mazicia Organa was deeply attached to her family. Her son Bail would remember her as a "doting" mother, and the Queen's love for her brother ultimately sent her into depression after he died.[7] During her reign, however, Organa proved to be far-sighted and proactive. She was capable of foreseeing the dark times to come, providing her descendants with a private starship that could be fitted for war.[1]
            Mazicia Organa was first mentioned in the 2006 October issue of the Star Wars Insider magazine, in the article "20 Things You Didn't Know About the Tantive IV." The article was written by Pablo Hidalgo as part of the Refresher Reading recurring feature. In the text, Mazicia Organa was only referred to as a past Queen of Alderaan, with no explicit mention of her family ties with Bail Organa.[1] Two years later, Bail Organa's mother was mentioned, albeit unnamed, in the novel The Clone Wars: Wild Space, written by Karen Miller.[7] The two characters were confirmed to be one and the same on page 15 of the 2010 reference book Star Wars Blueprints: Rebel Edition.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mazicia_Organa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMaziciaOrgana</string></dict>
        <key>Leia Organa Solo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.267.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Leia Organa Solo (born Leia Amidala Skywalker) was, at various stages of her life, a politician, revolutionary, and Jedi Knight of the New Jedi Order. The daughter of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo, Leia was the younger twin sister of Luke Skywalker, and, shortly after her birth, she became the adopted daughter of Bail Organa and Queen Breha of Alderaan, making her a Princess of Alderaan. An accomplished Senator, Leia Organa was most famous for her strong leadership during the Galactic Civil War and other subsequent galactic conflicts, making her one of the galaxy's greatest heroes. Later she married Han Solo, and became the mother of their three children: Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo. Around the start of the Swarm War, Leia unknowingly became a grandmother through Jacen's daughter Allana.
            She had a forceful personality and bright intellect, having accomplished much in her youth: she was a strong proponent for the Rebel Alliance, the youngest Senator ever of the Galactic Empire at eighteen standard years of age, and a member of the Royal Family of Alderaan. Years later, she was instrumental in the creation of the New Republic, and was elected to the position of Chief of State, serving twice in that office.
            Due to her powerful Force heritage, Leia, following her family's legacy, became a Jedi Knight in the New Jedi Order. She was partially trained by her brother Luke and later by Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne, who declared her a fully trained Knight at the end of the Swarm War. This training would serve her well as the galaxy teetered on the edge of collapse into civil war once more during the Second Galactic Civil War, although it complicated her allegiance. During this conflict, Leia's son Jacen turned to the dark side of the Force, becoming the Sith Lord Darth Caedus. Leia and Han became determined to destroy Caedus, feeling that their son was already dead. However, it was their daughter Jaina who ended his life in a lightsaber duel that also concluded the war.
            In the aftermath of Caedus' death, the Solos became the guardians of their granddaughter Allana, at the behest of her mother, Tenel Ka of Hapes, and remained two of the galaxy's most important figures, standing with the Jedi Order amidst the tensions that arose between it and the government of Chief of State Natasi Daala.
            A Human female, Leia was born on the asteroid colony of Polis Massa in 19 BBY, shortly after the start of the Great Jedi Purge and the formation of Palpatine's Galactic Empire. Her heavily-pregnant mother, the Naboo Senator Padmé Amidala, had been suffering a Force choke by her spouse Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight who had fallen to the dark side of the Force.[2] Amidala had been brought in a panic to a hospital of the Polis Massa Base by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had arranged rendezvous with Yoda, Grand Master of the Jedi Order, and Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.[16] Due to Amidala's condition, the Polis Massan surgeons were nearly forced to remove the twins she was carrying, but the children were born just in time. In a few, feeble breaths, Amidala named her twins "Luke" and "Leia." The Senator died mere moments after their birth, effectively orphaning Leia and her older twin brother.[2] The medtechs of the Polis Massan facility had been struggling to save Amidala, but their efforts had been in vain. With the twins' father believed dead on Mustafar, Bail Organa wondered what the Jedi intended to do with Luke and Leia.[16]
            Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda knew that the children, both strong in the Force, had to be protected from[2] the inherently evil[17] Emperor Palpatine, who intended to hunt down the remaining Jedi. Amidala's corpse was sent back to Naboo, with the instruction of making it look like she was still pregnant. In this way, nobody would know of the children's existence. When they decided it would be best if the twins were separated, Master Kenobi suggested that he would take the boy, and Master Yoda would take Leia. However, Yoda disagreed, arguing that they should wait for the right time before training the twins in the ways of the Force. At that point, Bail Organa offered to adopt baby Leia, as he and his wife were childless and longing for a daughter.[18] The Jedi agreed, and the infant boy Luke was sent to live on Tatooine with his father's stepbrother Owen Lars and his wife Beru. As promised, Leia was adopted and raised by Bail Organa and his wife, Queen Breha Organa,[2] who had been friends of Amidala during the antecedent conflict known as the Clone Wars.[19] Through adoption, Leia Amidala Skywalker became known as Leia Organa, Princess of Alderaan.[16] Nineteen years would pass before the twins saw each other again.[5]
            Leia, the orphaned daughter of the Naboo Senator and the fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, was given a loving home within the House of Organa,[2] one of the galaxy's so-called Ancient Houses.[20] Her adoptive parents could not have children of their own,[21] so Leia became the crown princess,[1] and, as such, was formally referred to as "the Princess Leia Organa, of the Royal House of Alderaan."[22] Although the Organas were not trying to hide the fact that Leia was adopted,[1] they never informed the Princess of her parentage, nor did they reveal the existence of her twin brother.[23] However, during the short time between her birth and her mother's death,[2] Leia gained a faint memory of her mother as a beautiful and kind, yet sad woman.[23]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Leia_Organa_Solo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLeiaOrganaSolo</string></dict>
        <key>Leia Organa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.268.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Leia Organa, a Force-sensitive human female, was a princess of Alderaan, a member of the Imperial Senate, a leader of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a member of the Galactic Senate, and general of the Resistance. Born alongside her twin brother, Luke Skywalker in the year 19 BBY as Leia Amidala Skywalker, she was the daughter of the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo. As a result of her father's fall to the dark side of the Force, the Skywalker children were separated with Leia becoming the adopted daughter of Senator Bail Organa and his wife, Queen Breha Organa, who renamed her Princess Leia Organa. Raised with the values of her adoptive parents, Organa supported the principles of the Galactic Republic and opposed the rule of its successor, the Galactic Empire. Despite succeeding to her adoptive father's post in the Imperial Senate, Organa worked in secret to undermine the Empire's operations and was entrusted with the stolen plans to the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon capable of destroying entire planets. Although she was unable to prevent the annihilation of her adopted homeworld, the plans were ultimately delivered to the Rebel Alliance, resulting in the destruction of the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY.
            Organa became a leading figure in the Alliance, participating in key events such as the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY and the decisive Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. She also killed the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, earning her the title of "Huttslayer." With the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and his apprentice, Darth Vader, the biological father of Organa and her brother, the Empire was defeated at the Battle of Jakku and subsequently forced to capitulate to the New Republic in 5 ABY. Having achieved her lifelong goal to overthrow the Empire and restore freedom to the galaxy, Organa settled down in an effort to start a family with her husband, the smuggler-turned-Rebel, Han Solo. She gave birth to their son, Ben Solo, on the day that marked the end of the Galactic Civil War. However, like his mother, Ben was born inherently strong with the Force due to his biological connection to the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker. Due to the similarities between Ben and his grandfather, Organa placed her son in the custody of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker in the hope that Ben would not turn to the dark side as Vader once did.
            As a senator of the New Republic, Organa opposed the Senate's lack of response to the rise of the First Order, a successor of the Empire in all but name. Sidelined by a new generation of political leaders, Organa founded the Resistance to monitor the activities of the First Order. By then, Organa's son had turned to the dark side and destroyed Skywalker's efforts to fully restore the Jedi Order. Adopting the persona of Kylo Ren, the former Ben Solo became the apprentice of Supreme Leader Snoke, although his mother remained hopeful that the light side of the Force still existed within her son. It was at Organa's request that her estranged husband attempt to bring Ren home, resulting in Han Solo's death at the hands of their son. Ren's parricidal actions caused Organa to lose faith in her son, believing he was indeed beyond the hope of redemption. At the same time, the First Order had risen with the intent of conquering the known galaxy in the wake of the Republic's collapse, leaving the Resistance alone in its war against the Empire's successor. Following the near destruction of the Resistance at the Battle of Crait, Organa retreated from the First Order with a handful of survivors aboard her late husband's starship, the Millennium Falcon.
            During the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Yoda set out on a journey to discover the secrets of immortality. His journey took him to Moraband, the ancient Sith homeworld, where he faced visions of the future. At the end of his journey, the Force Priestess, Serenity, who guided his journey told him that there was another Skywalker, and Yoda heard his voice from the future say so as well.[14] These events not only alluded to the potential he would sense in Leia,[15] but to what Yoda would tell her twin brother, Luke, about Leia in his last words, before his death.[10]
            Leia Amidala Skywalker[16] was born on the asteroid of Polis Massa[2] two days after the end of the Clone Wars and the newly established Galactic Empire's purge of the Jedi Order.[3] She and her twin brother, Luke, who was born shortly before her, were the children of Galactic Republic Senator Padmé Amidala, who died straight after labor, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who had recently fallen to the dark side of the Force. To protect the children from the Empire and the now–Sith Lord Darth Vader, Senator Bail Organa agreed to adopt the infant Leia together with his wife, Queen Breha of Alderaan, while Obi-Wan Kenobi personally watched over Luke, who would live with their father's stepbrother Owen Lars and his wife Beru, on the planet Tatooine.[2]
            Of the two Skywalker children, Yoda felt that Leia was more suited to be a Jedi, owing to her natural strength, will, and clarity (as opposed to her brother, who was impetuous, headstrong, unruly, and inattentive), wanting very much to train her.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Leia_Organa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLeiaOrgana</string></dict>
        <key>Ovolot Qail Uthan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.269.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Doctor Ovolot Qail Uthan was a scientist working for the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
            Doctor Uthan led the research on a clone-killing nanovirus, FG36, stationed on Qiilura. After the attack by Jedi Etain Tur-Mukan and Omega Squad, she was abducted and her research facility destroyed.
            As of 18 months after the Battle of Geonosis, Dr. Uthan was reportedly held in a Republic maximum-security prison. During her incarceration, she wondered whether or not the cloaked man who had commissioned her research tried to contact her. The man was most likely the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who kept her work as an insurance policy against the clones if they ever turned against him.
            In order to not lose her sanity, Dr. Uthan bred Soka flies inside her cell even without proper laboratory facilities. During the Battle of Coruscant, she was rescued from the madhouse at Valorum Center by Kal Skirata, Bardan Jusik, Ordo and Fi. She was brought to Mandalore where she agreed to Kal's offer of finding a cure to the clone's accelerated aging.
            While living on Mandalore, Uthan became romantically involved with Mij Gilamar, and bonded with Padawan Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy, a Jedi survivor living in Kyrimorut, making the young Jedi her lab assistant.
            Sometime after Order 66 the Sith formerly known as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine used her FG36 virus on her home planet of Gibad who was rebelling against the new Empire. The virus was not clone specific at the time it was released on her homeworld, killing every humanoid on the planet. Crushed by virtually destroying her whole home planet and the people she loved, she decided to retaliate by recreating the virus to release personally on Coruscant. Kal Skirata reasoned with her before she could to create a antivirus first, as a different way to fight Palpatine and protect themselves. The antivirus was then tested on herself to see if it worked, then it was spread all through Mandalore. It is assumed that she began work on returning the aging gene in clones to normal after FG36 was finished. It is unknown if she ever spread the virus to Coruscant.
            Doctor Uthan was able to convey strong emotion by whispering fiercely, or, when she was tied up by clone commandos, simply writhing and wriggling. She had wild hair that was mainly blue and black, with red stripes, and she was also fond of septsilk clothes. Ghez Hokan in particular was impressed by her subtle political skill, knack for dressing well and carrying herself like an empress.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ovolot_Qail_Uthan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemOvolotQailUthan</string></dict>
        <key>Augwynne Djo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.270.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Augwynne Djo was a female Human who was the leader of the Singing Mountain Clan of Dathomiri Witches, the grandmother of Teneniel Djo, great-grandmother of Tenel Ka, and great-great grandmother of Allana.
            Born on the planet of Dathomir decades before the founding of Palpatine's Galactic Empire, Augwynne Djo was a female Human and a member of the Witches of Dathomir, a society dominated by Force-sensitive women.[1] At some point before the rise of the Empire in 19 BBY, she had become the clan mother of the Singing Mountain Clan, a coven of witches that claimed the territory located in the vicinity of an eponymous landform. Mother Augwynne and her sisters were the guardians of a ruined Star Temple,[2] a mysterious pyramid built by the ancient Kwa to protect a powerful artefact.[4]
            During her tenure as clan mother, the life of Augwynne Djo unfolded in tragedy. All four of her daughters ended up being lost to her, either through death or betrayal. Djo's oldest daughter, Barukka, had dabbled in the forbidden teachings of the dark side of the Force, and the clan mother had been forced to cast her out. Her other daughter Allaya Djo, who acted as the clan's warmaster and had borne a daughter named Teneniel, met an untimely death in battle. Her youngest child, Kara'Teel, died while trying to protect her. But worst of all was the loss of Gethzerion, who had always been Mother Augwynne's favorite. Gethzerion and Barukka, both lost to the dark side, became Nightsisters and attempted to murder their own mother, a plan that was only foiled by the sacrifice of their youngest sister Kara'Teel, who gave her life to protect Augwynne.[5]
            Around 2 ABY Augwynne informed Jedi Knight Rachi Sitra about a danger one of the Nightsisters, Kyrisa, had represented to her clan.[6]
            Augwynne was present when Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia Organa arrived at the Singing Mountain Clan, and declared Han a free man after Leia presented his case. She struck a deal with Han, if she got him off Dathomir and gave him gold gems from Dathomir, he would give her the deed to the planet. She did not complete Han's third request, as she could not make Leia marry Han.
            Augwynne had no choice but to lead the sisters of the Singing Mountain Clan against Gethzerion's Nightsisters in order to give Han time to get the Millennium Falcon off Dathomir. She requested help from other clans, but none came. Thanks to Luke Skywalker, Isolder, Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and her granddaughter Teneniel Djo, the sisters of the Singing Mountain Clan were able to defend the clan and drive the Nightsisters away. Augwynne and the sisters were finally rid of the Nightsisters when they were shot down trying to escape Dathomir.
            After the Battle of Dathomir, Augwynne became the owner of Dathomir when Han Solo turned over the deed. Around the same time, her surviving daughter Barukka returned from the dark and rejoined the clan, much to Augwynne's joy. A few years before 22 ABY, Augwynne's favorite rancor died and her great-granddaughter Tenel Ka Djo kept two of the animal's smaller teeth.[7] In 23 ABY, she helped Luke and Tenel Ka find the resurgent Nightsisters and the Shadow Academy.[8] It is unknown what happened to her during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of Dathomir.
            By 18 BBY, she had the appearance of a sixty-year-old woman, with pale eyes and hair the color of moonlight. She was tall and regal, with facial features considered handsome by her fellow Humans, as well as graceful, long-fingered hands.[2] When in full regalia, Mother Djo wore a tunic of glittering yellow scales over a hide robe with black lizard shapes sewn around the hem. Her ceremonial headdress was made of smooth golden wood, and was decorated with cabochons of yellow tigereye.[1] On other occasions, Djo was known to wear a coronet of aurodium.[2]
            In Cracken's Threat Dossier, Augwynne's daughters are named as Gethzerion, Barukka, and Kara'Teel. Star Wars Encyclopedia and the Star Wars Customizable Card Game gives the name of her daughter as Allaya Djo. Curiously, she is also named as the person to have married Han and Leia Solo.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Augwynne_Djo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAugwynneDjo</string></dict>
        <key>Astri Oddo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.271.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Astri Oddo was a cook, adopted daughter of Didi Oddo,[4] and pre-owner of Dex's Diner.
            Astri served as the cook at Didi's Cafe, owned by her adopted father, Didi Oddo, who found her at the doorstep of the cafe. She came to meet Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi through her father. Later, when Obi-Wan's Master was captured and her father shot by the bounty hunter Ona Nobis, she went with Obi-Wan to find Jenna Zan Arbor, who held Qui-Gon Jinn captive, and the cure for Didi. She then "married a homesteader in the Outer Rim."[6] She was later married to Senator Bog Divinian, by whom she had a son, Lune Oddo Divinian. However, with the Jedi's help she left Bog behind for a long while, after taking up Nuralee as her adopted homeworld.
            In 18 BBY, she sabotaged the computer systems of the planet Samaria with the permission of prime minister Aaren Larker, prompting Emperor Palpatine to send Ferus Olin to hunt her down. However, the ex-Jedi instead helped her and her son escape the clutches of the Galactic Empire, and relocate on an secret asteroid base located in an atmospheric storm near the planet of Acherin.
            Later, she as well as her son Lune went to live in the Orange Sector of Coruscant, in the safe house of Dex.
            She spent much time with the Erased and trusted them enough to send Keets Freely and Curran Caladian to look after Lune. Unfortunately Imperial Stormtroopers kidnapped Lune to train as an Imperial Pilot. But Dexter sent Trever Flume and Ferus Olin to save him. She was very grateful to have Lune returned.
            When a mysterious young woman named Flam arrived to create a Rebellion team called Moonstrike, a friend of Ferus, Clive Flax, suspected her as an Imperial spy. He asked Astri to help. They then discovered that Flame was in fact Eve Yarrow, and that she was in league with the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Clive and her then contacted the base, warning them of this.
            After the base was destroyed by Vader's superweapon, Astri and Clive agreed to adopt Trever after his memory was wiped to protect him, making him forget what he knew about Darth Vader's real identity and everything that happened in the last year.
            Astri was killed along with Clive and Trever in their attempt to destroy an Imperial factory on Bellazura. Their son, Lune Divinian was unable to participate in the battle, and thus survived.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Astri_Oddo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAstriOddo</string></dict>

        <key>Ketsu Onyo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.274.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ketsu Onyo was a human female Mandalorian from Shukut who worked as a bounty hunter in the employ of Black Sun in the years prior to the Battle of Yavin. She was a friend of Sabine Wren and helped the cadet escape from the Imperial Academy on Mandalore. The two became bounty hunting partners before she and Wren parted on bad terms, and Wren joined the Spectres. After leaving Sabine for dead, Ketsu joined Black Sun.
            Ketsu later resurfaced on Garel where she accepted a job from Black Sun to steal a GNK-series power droid called EG-86, who was carrying sensitive information. However, this job brought her into conflict with Wren and her rebel associates Chopper and Ezra Bridger. Following a struggle that ended in the space above Garel, Ketsu and Sabine reconciled and the two joined forces to escape an Arquitens-class command cruiser and deliver EG-86 to the rebellion on Havoc Outpost. While Ketsu declined Wren's offer to join the rebellion, the two departed on friendly terms.
            Later, Ketsu helped the Phoenix Cell to obtain fuel from Horizon Base. She later aided the Spectres by fighting off Imperial forces during an Imperial attack on the rebel fleet. Ketsu's actions enabled the Ghost to land on the rebel flagship and deliver vital supplies to the rebels. Having refueled, the rebels were able to escape to the planet Atollon.
            Born on the planet Shukut in 22 BBY,[1] Ketsu Onyo was a Mandalorian warrior and artist[6] who lived during the Age of the Empire and studied with her friend Sabine Wren at the Imperial Academy on Mandalore.[4] At some point, they decided to escape the Academy, Ketsu helped her friend escape from the academy and the two became bounty hunters. However, Wren alleged that Ketsu became "greedy" and left her for dead while she alone joined Black Sun. Meanwhile, Sabine survived and joined a group of rebels that operated from the starship Ghost and was part of a larger rebellion against the Galactic Empire.[3]
            Several years later, Ketsu crossed paths with her former friend Sabine on the planet Garel. Onyo had been sent by Black Sun to collect the GNK-series power droid EG-86, who was carrying information of vital importance to the rebellion. The droid was scheduled to arrive on a GX1 short hauler at Garel City's spaceport. However, Ketsu's mission was complicated when she discovered that Sabine and two rebel associates, the astromech droid C1-10P and the human Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger, had already picked up the courier droid. Shortly after, Ketsu emerged from hiding and confronted Sabine.[3]
            After a tense reunion, Ketsu demanded that Sabine and her friends surrender EG-86. She also told Sabine that she would have been better off dead rather than joining the rebellion since the Empire had put a bounty on Sabine's head. Wren refused to back down and the two former friends prepared for a showdown. However, their confrontation was interrupted by the arrival of a stormtrooper patrol. When the stormtroopers demanded that they leave the spaceport, Onyo opened fire on the stormtroopers with her blaster; sparking a three-way gun battle. In the midst of the fighting, Sabine and her rebel associates managed to escape with EG-86 on a stolen shuttle. However, one of the rebels, Ezra, was separated from his comrades after falling out of the side entryway.[3]
            Ketsu was then surrounded by stormtrooper reinforcements who held her at gunpoint. However, she turned the tables on them and took the stormtroopers out in hand-to-hand combat. She then pursued the rebels on her personal starship Shadow Caster. In space, Ketsu quickly caught up with the rebels' shuttle and managed to disable its hyperdrive. Ketsu then shot open the shuttle's side door, causing a hull breach which sucked Chopper out into the vacuum of space. Satisfied that she made her point, Onyo brought the Shadow Caster face-to-face with the rebels' shuttle and repeated her ultimatum to Sabine.[3]
            Unknown to Ketsu, Chopper had survived the breach and had managed to use his rocket boosters to sneak up on the Shadow Caster. Having noticed that Chopper was sabotaging the Shadow Caster's main turbolaser turret, Sabine deliberately prolonged their conversation to give Chopper enough time to complete his work. When Onyo expressed pride at working for Black Sun, Sabine derided the crime syndicate as a bunch of slavers and assassins. After Sabine rejected her ultimatum again, Onyo reluctantly opened fire on Wren's shuttle only to discover that her turret had been sabotaged. This gave enough time for Sabine to escape in her shuttle.[3]
            However, Onyo managed to trap Chopper with the Shadow Caster's tractor beams and took him prisoner. Communicating with Sabine over the intercom, Sabine offered to trade Chopper for EG-86. Unwilling to abandon her rebel comrade to Ketsu, Sabine reluctantly returned and docked her shuttle with the Shadow Caster. Meeting face to face, Ketsu discovered that Sabine was determined not to give up the courier droid. She offered to split the bounty but Wren was not interested in profits and reiterated her devotion to the Rebel cause. Onyo was skeptical that the rebellion would succeed and responded that she was solely concerned with her own survival. After a tense discussion, the two former friends reconciled and Sabine forgave Ketsu for abandoning her.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ketsu_Onyo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKetsuOnyo</string></dict>

        <key>Jocasta Nu</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.276.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jocasta Nu was a female Human who served as the Chief Librarian of the Jedi Archives during the final days of the Galactic Republic, and who tended to show overconfidence in the completeness of her Archives. Her patterned robes bore the symbols of the Ansata, representing her devotion to knowledge and learning.[3]
            During her career, Nu served as a member of the Jedi High Council and trained many Padawans, including the future Emperor's Hand, Jerec; Olee Starstone, whom she tutored in the years prior to the Clone Wars; and Jin-Lo Rayce, founder of the Agents of Ossus. Jocasta Nu died when the 501st Legion ransacked the Jedi Temple at the end of the Clone Wars.
            Brought into the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Galactic Republic, it is likely Jocasta Nu was discovered by a recruiter of the Acquisition Division to be Force-sensitive around infancy before being brought to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training. Raised in a youngling clan, she passed the trials of the Jedi academy and was eventually selected by a Master for one-on-one training. Passing the Jedi Trials, Nu pursued the path of the Consular and became a researcher specializing in the field of archaeology. Attaching herself to the Exploration Corps after consulting the Council of Reassignment, Nu traveled the galaxy gathering information for the Jedi Archives. During her journeys Nu discovered the Force-sensitive Miraluka, Jerec, and delivered him to the Temple for entrance into the academy there. Eventually Nu returned to the Temple and selected Jerec as her Padawan, passing along her own desires to learn all there was to know in the galaxy, which eventually drove him to Knighthood himself. After her padawan completed his training, Nu was made a Jedi Master and began to perform the duties of an archivist in the Archives. Eventually, Nu was appointed Chief Librarian of the Archives and Library and made a member of the Librarian's Assembly.[2] Part of her responsibility as Chief Librarian was oversight of the Educational Corps; she reported directly to the Reassignment Council on all matters concerning this branch of the Jedi Service Corps.[4]
            During her tenure as Chief Librarian, Nu was appointed to the Jedi High Council in 62 BBY, serving on the august body before stepping down in ten years later. Foregoing the traditional brown robes of the Order, Nu began wearing a tunic and dress imprinted with ancient Ansata patterns, a type of dress worn by some of the most famed Jedi historians including the ancient Master Atris. Over the years, Nu came to know most of the Jedi in the Temple, becoming especially fond of Master Dooku; she personally mourned the loss of his great idealism when he left the Order shortly following the Invasion of Naboo. Using the extensive knowledge gained in the field with the ExplorCorps, Nu continued to gather a very precise and extensive knowledge of the galaxy.[2] Working in cooperation with the Jedi Councils, Nu was always advised of upcoming missions so that she could help prep a report for all Jedi about to depart the Temple.[5]
            In 52 BBY, Nu undertook a diplomatic mission to the world of Serenno with Jedi Masters Dooku, Qui-Gon Jinn and Sifo-Dyas. At the meeting, the Jedi team met Damask Holdings Magister Hego Damask, in reality the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis.[6] Nu took on her last Padawan, Jin-Lo Rayce sometime after the Stark Hyperspace War around 44 BBY, teaching him all of the secret passage ways in and out of the Temple. In 39 BBY, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent on a mission to Vorzyd IV. Nu provided the two Jedi with the information needed for them to complete their assignment.
            Over the course of her time as director of the Archives her confidence in the data stored in the stacks was whole; claiming that if something was not in the Archives, then it did not exist. This statement was belied when Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi was unable to find the aquatic world Kamino in the Archives and suggested that the Archives were incomplete; somewhat miffed, Madame Nu reiterated her belief that if an item was not in the Archives, it did not exist, and strode away to assist a young Padawan who had just arrived. Discovering that the files had been purged from the Archives' data banks, the integrity of the Archives came into question much to Nu's embarrassment.[7]
            With the Clone Wars underway in 22 BBY, the High Council became increasingly concerned with protecting the Archives as more and more Jedi were called away from Coruscant to fight on the front lines. As reprimand for failing to follow orders during the First Battle of Felucia, the High Council assigned Padawan Ahsoka Tano to guard duty within the Archives. Meeting Tano in the Archives' Rotunda, Nu familiarized the Togruta with security protocols in the Archives and around the Holocron Vaults. Putting Tano to the test, bounty hunter Cad Bane had sent Cato Parasitti into the Temple to assist in his infiltration mission. As a Clawdite, Parasitti was able to slip pass both Tano and Nu under the guise of the recently deceased Master Ord Enisence. Suspicious of Enisence's oddly curt behavior, Nu offered the Skrilling a gentle hand, only to be struck by the bounty hunter and rendered unconscious. Stealing Nu's identity, as well as her blue-bladed lightsaber, Parasitti broke through Temple security and allowed Bane to enter the Temple without much trouble. While distracting the Jedi monitoring Temple security, Parasitti was discovered by Tano to be an impostor. After a brief scuffle, Parasitti was defeated and placed under arrest, yet Bane had already successfully completed his mission to infiltrate the Vaults and escape unnoticed. Nu recovered shortly after and returned immediately to her work.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jocasta_Nu/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJocastaNu</string></dict>

            Nubyl was restored to full functionality by the same doctor who enhanced Durge and Jaing. Her cybernetic enhancements included a powered wheelchair, a pair of robotic arms, a mind-machine neural interface, her mouth covered with a breather, and her left eye replaced with a droid sensor.

        <key>Noana Sowrs</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.279.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Constable Noana Sowrs was a Human female who was the top law enforcement officer on the Outer Rim planet of Taris during the Mandalorian Wars. Married with two children, by 3964 BBY Sowrs had ascended to the head of the Taris Civil Authority and was tasked with dealing with a significant swoop gang problem growing in Taris' Lower City. That year, the graduating class at the Upper City's Jedi Tower was massacred, and while Sowrs spearheaded the search for accused killer Zayne Carrick, the former Jedi Padawan ultimately escaped, a development that led to widespread riots and the Jedi being pulled off Taris entirely. Sowrs' two children were kidnapped in the midst of the chaos, but that soon became the least of the Constable's problems, as the Mandalorian warrior clans attacked besieged Taris in the aftermath of the massacre and Sowrs joined a ragtag resistance group led by Senator Haydel Goravvus based in the Lower City.
            In the face of withering attacks from the Mandalorians, Sowrs and the Taris Resistance managed to join forces with the powerful swoop gang known as the Hidden Beks, who ingratiated themselves with Sowrs' group by returning her two children. With the combined strength of the Resistance and the Beks, Sowrs helped plan a surprise attack aimed at assassinating top Mandalorian tactician Cassus Fett, but the Resistance found itself outmaneuvered and crushed in a devastating ambush. Sowrs survived the Mandalorian assault and managed to ensure her children's escape from Taris, but was forced to flee into the rakghoul-infested wasteland known as the Undercity—there, Sowrs was ran to ground and infected with the rakghoul plague by a herd of the beasts, before being slain by Jedi Shadow Celeste Morne.
            A native of the planet Taris, Noana Sowrs was a law enforcement officer in the Taris Civil Authority during the era of the Mandalorian Wars. By 3964 BBY,[3] Sowrs had a husband[2] and had two young children, Nahk and Tallie.[3] Sowrs' law enforcement career eventually culminated in her taking the position of Constable, making her the top law enforcement officer on Taris. In her position as Constable, Sowrs had to deal with increasing problems posed by rampant swoop gang activity in the Lower City. At the time, Sowrs had been helping oversee policing activities by the Jedi Padawan class in training at the Jedi Tower in the Upper City, and was quoted in the Taris Holofeed as being hopeful that the apprentices would stay on Taris after they achieved Knighthood to help her keep control of the gangs.[1] Those hopes were dashed when the class was slain in a high-profile massacre at their knighting ceremony—Zayne Carrick, the lone survivor, was blamed as the murderer and, along with Snivvian "accomplice" Marn Hierogryph, became the subject of a massive manhunt. Although Carrick was actually an innocent patsy framed by the real perpetrators—the Masters of the Tower themselves—Constable Sowrs believed the Masters' story and worked with them in the effort to hunt Carrick and Hierogryph down, promising them that they would be found shortly.[4]
            Sowrs came through on her promise, tracking Carrick to the Lower City and cornering him and Hierogryph in a desolate trash heap known as Junk Junction. But while Sowrs had them outnumbered and had the power of the Jedi Masters at her side, Carrick and Hierogryph managed to flee in a hidden junk hauler owned by Arkanian Offshoot locals Jarael and Gorman "Camper" Vandrayk, blasting past the police cordon into interstellar space. As Sowrs' patrol cruiser was not spaceworthy, Sowrs had little choice but to call off pursuit of the craft[5] as it reached temporary safety in an asteroid field.[6] Carrick turned himself into bounty hunter Valius Ying a short time later, and was brought back to Taris to face the Jedi Masters amidst a frenzy of media attention and public fury. However, Carrick was rescued from summary execution by Hierogryph, Jarael and Vandrayk and the four fled Taris for good. Carrick's escape destroyed public confidence in the Jedi and in Taris law enforcement, and led to a wave of riots that overwhelmed the Civil Authority. Within three weeks, the riots had reached the Middle City, with rioters kidnapping Sowrs' children. Little remained to stop the lawlessness—half of Sowrs' force had fled, with the other half falling back to the Upper City, and the Jedi Tower Masters were recalled to Coruscant.[7]
            Within a few weeks, riots in the Middle City would be the least of Taris' problems. The Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, who were in the nascent stages of a war for supremacy with the Galactic Republic, took the departure of the Jedi from Taris as a signal to attack,[8] besieging Taris in the first great stab of the Mandalorian Wars. Still searching for her children, Sowrs joined up with a armed resistance led by Senator Haydel Goravvus, which carved out a territory in the Lower City from which it battled the Mandalorian invaders. Although Sowrs quickly became one of Goravvus' top lieutenants, Sowrs actively worked to sever the Resistance's ties with local swoop gangs also fighting the Mandalorians, as she believed that they were responsible for her children's disappearances[9] and she still intended on enforcing Tarisian law despite the circumstances.[3] However, as the Mandalorians continued withering attacks on the Resistance's territory, the swoop gang known as the Hidden Beks made contact with the Resistance—Zayne Carrick's presence with the Bek detachment caused a brief standoff, which was ended when Bek leader Gadon Thek revealed that he had brought Sowrs' two children with them.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Noana_Sowrs</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemNoanaSowrs</string></dict>
        <key>Noirah Na</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.280.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Noirah Na was a female Human Jedi Padawan who was trained by Master Simms and wielded a blue lightsaber during the Clone Wars.
            A Force-sensitive, Noirah Na was taken as a Padawan by Master Simms. During her apprenticeship, the Clone Wars broke out across the galaxy, and Na was made a Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic, fighting against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
            In 19 BBY, around the time of the Battle of Coruscant, Simms and Na joined Jedi Master Kai Hudorra on the planet Toola, where for weeks they attempted to thwart the Separatist occupation. Leading a group of clone troopers atop motmots in battle to destroy the main generators of the invaders, the Jedi used a diversionary tactic, managing to destroy the generators and defeat the droids. Their victory was short-lived however, as immediately following the battle, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine issued Order 66, which deemed the Jedi as enemies of the Republic.
            Sheltered by the wrecked wall of the Separatist base, Na was held back by Master Hudorra as Simms stood upon the ruined battlement and deflected the clones' blaster fire with her lightsaber. Na and Hudorra fled the scene on STAPs as Simms fell to the troopers' fire. Making it a great distance across the glaciers of Toola, one of the STAPs ran out of fuel, forcing the two Jedi to make their way on foot to Ithaqua Station. Unknown to Na and Hudorra, their former ally Commander Keller was in pursuit, and after discovering the abandoned STAPs, he commed the garrison in Ithaqua to prepare to intercept the two fugitives.
            Some time later, the two Jedi found themselves on a dock in the outskirts of Ithaqua. With clone troopers guarding the port, Hudorra recommended that they go underneath the town to avoid detection, and the two plunged into the freezing waters. Swimming beneath a warehouse, Hudorra cut his way through the floor using his lightsaber, and the pair emerged, cold but safe. Na asked Hudorra why the clones would turn on them and kill her Master, but the old Bothan had no answers for her. Instead, he reminded her that Simms had died for them, and that they must survive above all else. He searched through some of the crates in the warehouse and finally found a large warm blanket, ordering Na to strip out of her wet clothes and wrap herself in the fur. The two then rested for a brief time before Hudorra figured out what to do next.
            Later that day, Hudorra left Na alone so that he could gather credits, buy supplies, and gain information in the town's market. He was also able to book passage aboard a freighter heading toward the Core Worlds. While he was gone, Na opened up many of the other crates in the warehouse, searching for something to eat. While unable to find food, she did locate several heating units, and began to dry out their Jedi robes. When Hudorra returned however, he was greatly displeased, and called Na foolish. Noting that Jedi robes would cause them to be caught instantly, he discarded the robes into the water beneath the hole he had cut earlier, and instructed Na to dress in the new clothing he had bought. Na was downcast, and Hudorra softened, remarking that it must have been a long time since she had eaten. Na searched through the packages Hudorra had purchased, and was shocked to find not only blasters, but a slave tunic meant for a boy. Hudorra then pulled a knife out hacked off Na's hair, making her appear as if she was a male.
            Knowing that the nighttime temperatures of Toola would drive even the clone troopers indoors, Hudorra had the two of them make their move in the dead of night. Unable to take the lift to the local spaceport, due to Keller's search, the pair had to climb hundreds of meters of ladder instead. By the time they reached the top, dawn had arrived to the town, and the spaceport thrummed with activity. In order to keep up the ruse he had created, Hudorra forced Na to carry all their luggage as if she was truly a slave. Though stopped at boarding by a clone trooper, Hudorra made a fuss about being forced to pay for the "boy", and the trooper allowed the two aboard.
            Over the course of the journey to Coruscant, Hudorra cautioned Na on how to alter her behavior to avoid detection during the dark times they now found themselves in. He told her to abandon the ways of thinking and fighting that she had been taught, and to instead flee in the face of danger, or use her blaster instead. After docking on Coruscant, the pair made their way to the Temple Precinct, where they soon came upon the ruined Jedi Temple and the enormous pile of dead Jedi burning on the Temple's steps. Na cried out in shock, and both Jedi recoiled, hidden by the crowd amassed around the entrance. Those in the crowd remarked on the turn of events, with some believing the Emperor's lies about the Jedi and others in disbelief.
            Suddenly, a fellow Jedi, still wearing his Jedi robes, emerged from the crowd and began to speak. He extolled both the Jedi in the crowd, whom he knew to be watching, and the civilians to join him in striking a blow against the fledgling Empire. Na began to draw her lightsaber, but Hudorra placed his hand upon hers and restrained her. Other Jedi in the crowd—among them, Koffi Arana, Dass Jennir, and Shadday Potkin—also stayed their hands. The Jedi charged up the steps of the Temple, engaging the troopers head-on. Though he was able to deflect more than a few bolts from their blasters and bisected one of the clones, they quickly overwhelmed and killed him, and his body was dragged onto the pile of burning corpses.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Noirah_Na</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemNoirahNa</string></dict>
        <key>Enfys Nest</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.281.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Enfys Nest was a human female resistance fighter who led the Cloud-Riders, a band of pirates and rebel group that fought against the crime syndicate Crimson Dawn. Nest's skills as a pirate earned her a reputation as an infamous marauder including in Crimson Dawn, who Nest and her Cloud-Riders actively fought against in retaliation for the atrocities Crimson Dawn had committed against them. Nest, who wore a battle helmet passed down to her from her mother, had run-ins with Crimson Dawn operative Tobias Beckett and his gang.
            In 10 BBY, Nest and the Cloud-Riders sparred with Beckett and his crew, including Han Solo, as they competed for a score of valuable hyperspace fuel called coaxium. After both groups failed to steal a shipment on Vandor, Nest and her lieutenant, Weazel, tracked Beckett’s crew as they stole coaxium from Kessel. Nest and the Cloud-Riders found Beckett’s crew on Savareen, where she revealed the group’s true purpose as allies fighting against Crimson Dawn. Solo sided with Nest and they teamed up to steal the coaxium from Crimson Dawn, dealing the syndicate a critical blow in the process. Nest intended to use the coaxium to help give life to a rebellion, so she gave the coaxium to Saw Gerrera of the Partisans and his young ward, Jyn Erso.
            Born during the twilight years of the Galactic Republic around 28 BBY[1] into a family whose women fought to protect the galaxy for many generations,[4] Enfys Nest was the daughter of a woman who led the Cloud-Riders,[5] a band of pirates who sought reprisal against the Galactic Empire and criminal syndicates that terrorized the galaxy. She came from a world that was brutalized by the criminal organizations of the Five syndicates[2] and carried a specific vendetta against Crimson Dawn[5]—widely considered the deadliest and most powerful of the Five syndicates[6]—for what they did to her homeworld, family and innocents across the galaxy. Around 12 BBY[7] Nest's mother perished, leaving the 16-year-old Nest to take up the mantle of her mother's distinctive mask and armor and her place as leader of the Cloud-Riders to carry on the mission of fighting back against the threats to the galaxy's safety.[5] With her identity and age hidden behind mask and vocoder chest box, she built a reputation as an infamous and dangerous pirate, not underestimated for her youth as she had been in the past.[8]
            In 11 BBY,[9] about a year following her ascension to leader of the Cloud-Riders, Nest led a squad of six marauders on a raid of an Imperial spice cache on Gargon. The raiding party approached the cache aboard their swoop bikes and stole its stores of medicinally processed spice, kept in ready-for-use triage kits and emergency packs. Although pursued by Imperial forces that came near to closing in on them, the Nest and the Cloud-Riders successfully escaped with their quarry. In the ensuing Imperial Security Bureau investigation of the incident, Agent Andressa Divo observed how the raiding party took only the medicinally processed spice, forgoing the raw spice that could be refined into a lucrative narcotic form and sold for immense profit. While her compatriots attributed this curiosity to a hurried escape forced by Imperial pursuit, Divo judged it was a deliberate decision on Nest's part and reflective of the ideological motives behind her gang's activities. She suspected Nest was not simply out to make a profit but fostering an insurrectionist movement against the Empire and preparing an army to go to war.[10]
            In need of some blank identichips, Nest decided to trick her rival Tobias Beckett into acquiring some for her. Nest sent a transmission to Beckett and his crew, posing as Dryden Vos of the Crimson Dawn. Believing Vos wanted them to steal blank identichips, Beckett and his crew stole a package of identichips from Dvorad on Hovun IV.[11]
            Beckett's gang took their cargo to the space station Munt Ontdal on the Rampart. However, when they arrived, they discovered that it had been a setup when Nest and her Cloud-Riders confronted them, managing to take them prisoner. Beckett tried to intimidate them with the threat of Dryden Vos showing up, but Val had deduced that Nest had been the one to send them on their mission. Nest threatened Beckett with a blaster, asking him where the identichips had been hidden. To prevent Nest from getting the cargo, Beckett destroyed the Rampart, escaping with his crew during the explosion.[11]
            Having been a thorn in the side of Tobias Beckett and Crimson Dawn for an extended period of time, the possibility of Nest and the Cloud-Riders interfering with Beckett's heist on Vandor was brought up by Val, whose advice fell on deaf ears; Beckett had been assured that only he and his inside men had the knowledge of the supply carried by a 20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport in the mountains of Vandor. However, Val's fears were soon proven correct when Enfys Nest arrived with her Cloud-Riders, attempting to thwart an attempt by Beckett's gang to steal a large quantity of coaxium from the conveyex, wanting to take the coaxium for themselves. As Beckett and his gang detached the train car carrying the hyperfuel, Nest and the Cloud-Riders, flying swoops, attached tow cables to the car and attempted to wrest the fuel from Beckett's stolen Y-45 armored transport hauler, flown by Rio Durant and Han Solo. In the ensuing struggle, the coaxium cargo fell into a mountainous ravine, resulting in a huge explosion.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Enfys_Nest</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemEnfysNest</string></dict>

            The Nelprin family was fairly well known in the New Republic Defense Fleet for their proficiency in unarmed combat.[1] Shalla's father was Vyn Narcassan, a Galactic Republic intelligence officer who disappeared after the rise of Palpatine's Galactic Empire.[2] He was hunted by the Imperials but was never found.[4] Nelprin and her sister, Vula, were both trained by Narcassan in hand-to-hand techniques, leading Vula to become a successful instructor in the art. Vula was Kell Tainer's instructor, and could toss him around like a rag doll—Nelprin claimed she was even better, and her performance supported this.[1]
            She managed to infiltrate Zsinj's headquarters, thanks to Kell's previous mention of her under an alias, during a previous meeting with Zsinj. However, due to an absent-minded boast during said meeting, she was forced to fight Captain Radaf Netbers in hand-to-hand combat. Face had bragged she could beat a Wookiee, Kell gave details, and this prompted Netbers to try and confirm it. Luckily, Nelprin's own boasts were not exaggerated, leading to Netbers having his nose broken.[1] She faced Netbers a second time during a later mission, and charged him to prevent discovery of her identity. Netbers nearly murdered her, except her squadron-mate Hohass Ekwesh intervened.[4]
            After her participation in the Battle for the Razor's Kiss with the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Razor's Kiss, Nelprin was promoted to lieutenant and granted permission to paint half of an Executor-class silhouette on her X-wing.[1]
            Although not present during the Wraith operations against the Yuuzhan Vong, Nelprin transferred to New Republic Intelligence Service with the majority of her squadron when they were recommissioned as an intelligence unit.[4]
            Nelprin would again appear in 40 ABY as a member of Intelligence investigating Syal Antilles during the Second Galactic Civil War, no longer a Wraith Squadron member.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shalla_Nelprin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemShallaNelprin</string></dict>

Before her fall, Nayama was the wife of Padawan Jolee Bindo.
            A Force-sensitive Human from Ukatis, Nayama was a member of the Ukatis Enforcers serving the tyrannical Ukatisian monarch. During her service to the monarch, Padawan Jolee Bindo of the Jedi Order traveled to Ukatis on a mercy mission smuggling supplies to the Ukatis citizenry through a blockade set up by the Ukatis government. Opposed to Galactic Republic involvement, Nayama was ordered to track Bindo's ship and shoot it down; a mission she succeeded in completing. Bindo was captured and she managed to foil three of his escape attempts while in captivity, though eventually he won her over and they fell in love. Helping him escape offworld, the two were married; although marriage was frowned upon by many Jedi of the time and was deemed unacceptable for a member of the Order. Immediately, Bindo noticed that Nayama was strong in the Force, which is why she was able to shoot him down. Deciding to train her as a Jedi, Bindo's status as a Padawan and Nayama's age caused the Jedi High Council to deny his request. Ignoring the High Council's wishes, Bindo began secretly training her in the ways of the Jedi.[1]
            The joy of Jolee's marriage to Nayama was not to last as the words of fellow Padawan Exar Kun inspired her to join in his dream of heralding in a Golden Age of the Sith. Urging her husband to abandon what she called "the decrepit trappings of the Jedi" and join her in Kun's war of conquest, Bindo pleaded with her to reconsider and think about what she would become and what she would be throwing away. In her frustration and failure to convince her husband and mentor to join the Sith, she drew her lightsaber and attempted to strike him down. The battle between husband and wife was long and difficult but eventually Bindo gained the upper hand and defeated her; it was at this moment he realized his wife had fallen to the dark side. At his mercy, Bindo refused to kill the woman he loved and he let her go. She followed many other fallen Jedi of that time, including Oss Wilum, Crado, and Ulic Qel-Droma in their attempt to create a new golden age in a conflict which quickly came to be known as the Great Sith War.[1]
            The mistake of sparing the woman would come to haunt Bindo for years to come, as he allowed her to join Exar Kun, going on to kill many Jedi during the war until she herself was slain in the final battle on Yavin 4. The High Council decided to put Bindo on trial for his actions by training Nayama against their wishes and for him allowing her to escape his grasp. Though he was absolved of all responsibility, with the High Council citing mitigating circumstances and that he deserved compassion and he learned wisdom the hard way for all his actions during the war, the High Council decided to raise him to full Jedi status.[1]
            The decision would come to haunt Bindo because he believed he deserved to be punished and that the Jedi forgave him; however, he could never forgive himself. According to him, that was when the Jedi left him, and that was where they failed him. Filled with sadness for the loss of his wife, he decided to leave the Jedi and head for the uncivilized parts of the galaxy. It was on his way that his ship was damaged in an asteroid field and he ended up in the Shadowlands of Kashyyyk, where he decided to exile himself.[1]
            Nayama is first mentioned in the computer and video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, developed by BioWare. She is never actually seen; all the details of her life are related to the player, as Revan, through optional conversational dialogue with Jolee Bindo.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nayama</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemNayama</string></dict>
        <key>Natasi Daala</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.288.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Natasi Daala was a Human female who became the first woman to reach the rank of admiral in the Imperial Navy, and later was named Chief of State of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. Born on Irmenu but raised on Botajef, Daala enlisted in the Imperial Navy on Carida, but was discriminated against due to her gender. However, she achieved success thanks to Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who discovered her after she defeated many skilled Imperial opponents in simulated battles, using an alias to hide her true identity. Tarkin took her under his wing, and as he rose in the ranks, so did she. She became his lover and was eventually promoted to admiral by him. Shortly after, she was sent to oversee the top-secret Imperial research facility known as the Maw Installation. There, some of the best scientists in the galaxy worked on new concepts, designing superweapons for the Empire. She resided there with four Imperial I-class Star Destroyers for eleven years, unaware of what was happening in the galaxy.
            In 11 ABY, Kyp Durron, Han Solo, and Chewbacca stumbled upon the facility after making an emergency escape from Kessel. She interrogated them, and was stunned to learn that Tarkin and Emperor Palpatine were dead and the Empire was on the verge of collapse, having been defeated by the Rebel Alliance. She decided to launch her campaign to wreak havoc on the galaxy and gain revenge for Tarkin's death, with her four Star Destroyers and the Sun Crusher superweapon. However, the Sun Crusher was stolen from her by Solo and his two companions, who were also able to warn the New Republic of Daala's existence. Ultimately, Daala accomplished little, and with three of her Star Destroyers destroyed, headed back to the Maw to try to protect it from the New Republic. There, she found New Republic forces, who attacked her fleet. Though she managed to destroy the Installation, preventing the New Republic from gaining new weapons, her Star Destroyer was damaged and she made an emergency hyperspace jump.
            In 12 ABY, Daala attempted to unify the Imperial warlords, but found little success. She executed them, then took command of their forces. She once again attempted to destroy the New Republic, this time with the aid of Vice Admiral Gilad Pellaeon. However, she was defeated, and relinquished command to Pellaeon, resigning from the military. A year later, she re-appeared to aid the New Republic against the corrupt Moff Tol Getelles, then disappeared, swearing she was done with military service. It was at this time that Daala was reunited with her former lover Liegeus Vorn; the two married and later had a son. In 17 ABY she once again attacked the New Republic, but was defeated.
            The New Republic believed she was dead, but Daala stunned them when, in 40 ABY, she revealed herself to the galaxy once more. Commander of the Maw Irregular Fleet, she split from the Imperial Remnant to join the Mandalorians and fight against Darth Caedus, the despotic leader of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. Following the death of Caedus, she became the new Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance. After attempting to fix what Caedus had done, she displayed a strong anti-Jedi sentiment, exiling Luke Skywalker as part of a backlash against the Jedi. However, after she ordered a siege of the Jedi Temple and entered a severe dispute with the acting Grand Master, Kenth Hamner, her actions caused her to be perceived more negatively by the public and viewed as a tyrant by the Jedi. Unable to handle her increasingly extreme policies, a group of Jedi led a coup to depose her. Sent to prison, Daala was able to escape from confinement with the help of the bounty hunter Boba Fett and began to plan her revenge on those who had removed her from power.
            Thanks to Boba Fett's intelligence, Daala blackmailed several members of the Council of Moffs to join her in overthrowing Head of State Jagged Fel and taking control of the Imperial Remnant. However, the betrayal of Moff Tol Getelles and the arrival of Empire of the Hand ships to support Fel forced Daala into a siege at Exodo II. As Daala and Fel faced off, political instability erupted in the Remnant and, under the advice of Lieutenant Lydea Pagorski, Daala offered to compete with Fel in a general election for Head of State. Daala campaigned against Fel and Admiral Vitor Reige. Despite Fel's withdrawal, Reige defeated Daala, ending her ambitions.
            Born to Human parents on Irmenu, a feudal, oceanic planet located in the Belsmuth sector of the Outer Rim Territories, Natasi Daala hailed from a princely family. When she was still an infant, rivals of Daala's family managed to overrun and seize their holdings. While the rest of Daala's family was put to death, a younger son of the rival family took pity on Natasi and smuggled her offworld. Daala's benefactor left her on Botajef at an orphanage[11] owned by COMPNOR and run by Renatasian nuns, where she was then raised.[1] When she was young, Daala fell in love with the holo faker Liegeus Vorn. However, feeling a need for a sense of duty, she enrolled in the Academy of Carida to serve the Empire, and so left Vorn.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Natasi_Daala</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemNatasiDaala</string></dict>

Natala disliked the fact that Zeerid was forced to do illegal work to provide for them, and she worked hard on Vulta, although she was unable to make enough to buy a decent living space. Her relationship to Zeerid was strained, but they both worked their hardest to provide Arra with what they could.

        <key>Sola Naberrie</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.291.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sola Naberrie was a Human female from the Mid Rim planet of Naboo. She was the elder daughter of Ruwee and Jobal Naberrie, the sister of Padmé Amidala, as well as the mother of Ryoo and Pooja Naberrie. She would later become the maternal aunt to twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo.
            Sola met her future husband Darred Janren, a young architect, while studying at a Naboo university. Shortly after her marriage, she had two daughters, Ryoo and Pooja. Sola and Darred recognized the fact that the Naberrie name was well-known within the social and political circles of Naboo, and therefore decided to keep it as the family name.[1]
            Having settled happily into a domestic life, Sola worried about Padmé's choice of life, wondering if her "little baby sister" would ever settle down and have children of her own.[5] She also greatly enjoyed teasing Padmé about men who would make likely suitors for her, much to her sister's exasperation.[1] Sola even told Anakin Skywalker, her future brother-in-law, that he was "the first boyfriend" Padmé had ever brought home to the family.[3]
            Shortly after the Clone Wars had ended, Sola, along with her family and thousands of other mourners, attended her sister's funeral.[4]
            Her youngest daughter Pooja later became Naboo's representative in the Imperial Senate.[6]
            Sola Naberrie was portrayed by Claudia Karvan,[7] an Australian actress perhaps most well-known for her work on TV programs The Secret Life of Us and Love My Way.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sola_Naberrie/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSolaNaberrie</string></dict>

This relationship made her the first cousin of twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo.
            Similarly to her sister Ryoo, who was named after their mother's maternal grandmother, Pooja received the name of her father's maternal grandmother. As a child, she was considered to be very talkative and like many other young children, she seemed to have a new idea for what she wanted to be when she grew up every week and often spoke of being a senator, a teacher, a starfighter pilot, a tusk cat trainer, and even an astromech droid.[2] It is said that she, like her sister, had a crush on Anakin Skywalker, the future husband of their aunt, when he visited and she also liked playing games with him and asked a lot of questions.[6]
            In 21 BBY, Amidala had been compelled to miss Pooja's fifth birthday celebrations because of her work in the Galactic Senate. She had sent a gift to Pooja and commed her beloved niece on the day, but she still felt guilty for not being able to be there in person.[7]
            Two years later, Pooja, along with the rest of the Naberrie family and thousands of other mourners, attended her aunt Padmé's funeral shortly after the Clone Wars ended.[8]
            In 6 BBY, at age 20, Pooja was appointed representative of Naboo's sector in the Imperial Senate by Queen Kylantha, succeeding Senator Jar Jar Binks. This made her a colleague of her cousin, Leia Organa, the senator of Alderaan, and the two became good friends, completely unaware of their familial relationship.[6] She would hold the position of senator until the Imperial Senate's dissolution in 0 BBY.[5]
            During the Galactic Civil War, Pooja was a secret Rebel sympathizer, but also a great supporter of the queen. In order to ensure Senator Naberrie's security, a woman named Kima Nazith served as Pooja's bodyguard.[5]
            Around 36 ABY, Leia met with Pooja and told her about her discovery that Padmé was her mother and that the two of them were first cousins. Pooja subsequently recounted to Leia her recollections of Anakin Skywalker.[6]
            The character was portrayed by Hayley Mooy in a deleted scene of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, as well as in a brief scene of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pooja_Naberrie/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemPoojaNaberrie</string></dict>

This relationship made her the first cousin of twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo.
            Ryoo was named after her mother Sola's maternal grandmother, Ryoo Thule, as well as a blue and yellow flower that grew in the outlying hills near the city of Keren. Of her and her younger sister Pooja, Ryoo was the more temperamental sister. Ryoo and her sister would often accompany their mother on visits to their grandparents, and would visit with Jev Nerran, a neighbor and friend of the family.[1]
            During her childhood, Ryoo attended the best schools where she learned classic futhork calligraphy, a subject she disliked. As a young girl, she owned a pet voorpak named Sanani, which she often dressed up to share many of her imaginary adventures.[1]
            In 22 BBY, Ryoo and the rest of the family met Jedi Anakin Skywalker when her aunt, Padmé Amidala, brought him to the Naberrie family home in Naboo's capital city of Theed.[3] Three years later, at the end of the Clone Wars, Ryoo, along with her family and thousands of other mourners, attended her aunt's funeral in the streets of Theed.[4]

            Thalia May and a group of fellow students from the Sith Academy on Korriban refused to execute a group of civilians from the nearby Dreshdae colony on the orders of Headmaster Uthar Wynn. In response, Uthar ordered the students executed as punishment. Before the sentence could be carried out, May and her companions escaped into the nearby shyrack cave. No one from the Academy was willing to brave the dangers of the caves to find them and carry out Master Uthar's order.

        <key>Delian Mors</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.297.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Delian Mors was a human female who served as a Moff in the Galactic Empire in the years after the end of the Clone Wars. In 14 BBY, Mors served as the Imperial Moff of the Outer Rim planet of Ryloth. Her underling Colonel Belkor Dray grew frustrated with her leadership and collaborated with the Free Ryloth movement in an attempt to discredit her. Mors was caught up in a plot by Cham Syndulla to assassinate Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. In an attempt to unseat her, Belkor collaborated with Cham. However, Mors and the two Sith Lords outsmarted their opponents. Mors exacted revenge against Belkor and executed him.
            In the early days of the Empire's rule over the galaxy, Delian Mors' wife, Murra, was killed in a transport accident. Around the same time, she was assigned to the Outer Rim planet of Ryloth, a post she considered undesirable. Her loss and her assignment felt like a burden, one that made her neglect some of her duties. A known spice addict, she lived a luxurious lifestyle on Ryloth's largest moon while assigning the day to day affairs of her position to her disgruntled underling Colonel Belkor Dray. Mors lived in a luxurious palace and was attended by green-skinned Twi'lek servants, all women and all scantily clad, who moved like pale-green ghosts through the rooms. Although none could leave, the Moff refused to call them slaves. With Dray taken aback by Mors' negligent lifestyle and shady contacts, he took it upon himself to actively support a growing resistance movement on the planet in an attempt to tarnish Mors' reputation and place himself in command.[1]
            In 14 BBY, Colonel Belkor visited Moff Mors at her luxurious palace on Ryloth's moon. The Moff was meeting with Nashi the Hutt, an envoy of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. After Belkor arrived, Mors concluded her meeting with Nashi and allowed her to leave with three cases of Theenwine. When Nashi made a joke about Belkor in Huttese, Mors translated that he was as straight and rigid as a tree. Mors described Belkor as a young ambitious officer. Following Nashi's departure, Mors turned her attention to Belkor and asked if he despised her for her dealings with the Hutts and decadence.[1]
            Belkor denied this was the case and claimed that rank came with privilege, concealing his disdain for her. Belkor then proceeded to deliver Mors his quarterly report, which the Moff took little interest in. When Mors inquired about the Free Ryloth "terrorists", Belkor reported that he had dispatched his best assets to due with the case and that things on Ryloth had been quiet for a month. Mors then mentioned a recent failed attempt by the Free Ryloth Movement to hijack an Imperial weapons shipment. When Mors inquired about Belkor's counter-insurgency efforts, he reported that the insurgents had blended in with the local population and that killing innocents indiscriminately would only increase sympathy for the Free Ryloth Movement.[1]
            Mors then mentioned that Senator Orn Free Taa would be returning to Ryloth within ten days. She speculated that the Emperor Palpatine had ordered him back to publicize the failed terrorist hijacking and to offer support for the Imperial occupation. Belkor volunteered to handle the Senator's welcoming. Before leaving, she told Belkor to lighten up and to enjoy life and to fetch her wine girl. Unknown to Mors, Belkor planned to arrange for the Free Ryloth Movement to assassinate Orn Free Taa so that he could pin the blame on Mors. Both were unaware that the Emperor and Darth Vader were accompanying Orn Free Taa as part of a plan to lure the Free Ryloth Movement out of hiding.[1]
            After Cham Syndulla's forces ambushed and attacked the Imperial Star Destroyer Perilous, Belkor contacted Moff Mors via hologram. When Belkor reported the ambush, Mors chastised the Colonel for allowing a fleet of rebel ships to hold position at the edge of the Ryloth system. Belkor claimed his resources were limited and that they did not normally patrol that far out in the system. In truth, Belkor had diverted patrol craft and flight clearances in a way that had allowed Cham to move his ships into position. To ameliorate Mors, Belkor suggested calling for all available repair ships to give to the Perilous. Mors obliged and allowed Belkor to manage the relief effforts[1]
            While Belkor went to dispatch repair ships, Mors conferred with another official and learned that the Emperor and Darth Vader were indeed aboard the Perilous. Knowing the Emperor and Vader's fearsome reputations, Mors was afraid that
            Despite her efforts, the Perilous was destroyed in orbit. Breehld informed Moff Mors of the news. This was a shocking development for Mors because this was the first time that an Imperial Star Destroyer had been destroyed. Mors feared that her career was in tatters as a result of the Star Destroyer's ambush. Mors then contacted Belkor who informed her that Lord Vader and the Emperor had escaped the Perilous's destruction. Since there were many survivors landing in escape pods, Belkor directed Breehld to assist in rescuing the Emperor and Vader. When Mors demanded to know why V-wing starfighters and rescue craft had not been diverted, Belkor claimed that he had delayed launching reinforcements to avoid colliding with the Perilous's wreckage.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Delian_Mors</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDelianMors</string></dict>

        <key>Kasan Moor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.299.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kasan Moor was an Imperial TIE interceptor pilot and flew as the lieutenant of the elite 128th TIE Interceptor Squadron. Following the destruction of her homeworld, Alderaan, by the Empire's Death Star, Moor grew something of a hatred for the Empire and would defect to the Rebel Alliance during the Alliance's liberation of Gerrard V.
            Moor's knowledge of Imperial installations and her exceptional piloting skills were reason for her induction into the legendary Rogue Squadron, an Alliance starfighter unit led by Commander Luke Skywalker. Flying under the callsign Rogue Seven, Moor led the Alliance through a string of several victorious hit and run operations against various Imperial bases. Following her assistance in bringing down Moff Kohl Seerdon, Moor retired from being an active member of Rogue Squadron to be an advisor to Mon Mothma, Chief of the Rebel Alliance. She would once more fly for Rogue Squadron during the Battle of Calamari years later.
            Moor was an orphan raised to be a pilot for the Empire (despite the fact her parents were members of the Rebel Alliance). She rose to the rank of lieutenant and, after proving her prowess, was given command of the 128th TIE Interceptor Squadron, which Rogue Squadron member Wes Janson later referred to as "the best of the best." One of her known activities with the group during her time with the Empire was to find potential candidates for Imperial takeover on the gas giant Taloraan.[1] Moor and the 128th were so well regarded that both she and the squadron were mentioned as an example of what the best pilots and machines can do in the official Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide.
            Her views on the Empire changed following the destruction of her home planet, Alderaan, by the first Death Star. After she was assigned to put down a rebel uprising on the planet Gerrard V, Kasan's TIE Interceptor's controls were damaged by repeated ion cannon blasts from Gold Squadron member Crix Madine. When Madine forced Moor to surrender herself, Moor admitted her quarrels with the ideals of the Empire, and offered defection to the Alliance.[1]
            Kasan was taken to Rebel service during the Liberation of Gerrard V by one of Crix Madine's Y-wings. Moor donated her TIE interceptor to the Alliance Fleet, and offered her knowledge of Imperial installations to the elite Rogue Squadron, led by Commander Luke Skywalker. Due to her knowledge and prowess at piloting starfighters, Moor was inducted into Rogue Squadron as Rogue Seven. Her knowledge was used to lead a raid on an Imperial storage facility on the Jade Moon. Rogue member Wedge Antilles did not trust Moor, but Moor continued to prove her allegiance by assisting Rogue Squadron in attacks on Balmorra and Kile II.[1]
            Moor took part in the rescue of Antilles from the Imperial prisons on Kessel following his capture on Kile II. With Rogue Squadron again at full strength, Moor assisted Rogue Squadron in attacks on Taloraan and Fest, raids which were aimed at reducing the resources of Imperial Moff Kohl Seerdon, who was amassing his forces for a massive attack on the Alliance's bacta supply on the jungle world Thyferra. She confronted Seerdon directly during Seerdon's retaliatory attack on Chandrila, homeworld of one of the Alliance's founders, Mon Mothma. Seerdon insisted that her defection to the Rebellion would be her undoing, and was a waste of her prowess. While Moor was intent on pursuing Seerdon, Luke Skywalker persuaded her otherwise.[1]
            Moor's knowledge led to another raid on Imperial territory, this time on the Capacitor on the volcanic planet of Sullust. Seerdon had used this raid to his advantage, and used the time that the Rebellion was focused on Sullust to achieve his goal of seizing the Alliance's supply of bacta on Thyferra. Moor took part in the battle to reclaim the bacta. During the battle, her X-wing starfighter was shot down by Imperial forces, but she managed to survive the crash-landing.[1]
            It is believed that Moor retired from Rogue Squadron sometime before the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY. She would remain a member of the Rebel Alliance, acting as an advisor to Mon Mothma, General Crix Madine, and Admiral Gial Ackbar, and continued to use her knowledge of Imperial operations to aid the fledgling Rebellion.[2]
            Years later, though she had long since retired from her role in Rogue Squadron, Moor flew for the team again during the Battle of Calamari.[1] This was done as a personal favor for Wedge Antilles, who was promoted to Rogue Leader following the retirement of Luke Skywalker. Since she was not an "official" member of the group during the battle, no New Republic records describe her participation during the battle.[2]
            Kasan Moor was voiced by Olivia Hussey. She was named after the radio station KSAN.[3]

        <key>Mon Mothma</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.300.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mon Mothma was a human female politician and revolutionary leader who served in the Galactic Senate and Imperial Senate as the representative of Chandrila, the leader of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and the first Chancellor of the New Republic. Mothma came to political prominence during the Separatist Crisis and the Clone Wars when, along with such allies as Senators Bail Organa and Padmé Amidala, she became an outspoken proponent of peace between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. She also spoke out against the increase in executive power given to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who transformed the Republic into the Empire at the war's end.
            Mothma worked with Organa and other allies to plant the seeds of rebellion against the Imperial regime. Mothma left the Senate after publicly denouncing Emperor Palpatine, which was soon followed by the establishment of the Rebel Alliance. Mothma sanctioned the recruitment of Jyn Erso, who led the Rogue One squadron in stealing the Death Star plans during the Battle of Scarif. After the Battle of Yavin saw the destruction of the Death Star, Mothma led the Alliance through the Galactic Civil War. The Battle of Endor, which Mothma helped plan with the Alliance High Command, saw the death of Emperor Palpatine and left the Empire in chaos.
            In Endor's aftermath, the Rebellion formed the New Republic and headquartered the new Galactic Senate on Chandrila. Mothma was elected as the first chancellor of the New Republic Senate and intended to do away with Palpatine's emergency powers, which the Senate gave to the office of the New Republic chancellery. She also intended to demilitarize the Republic, hoping to cut the New Republic Defense Fleet by ninety percent while leaving the defense of member worlds to the worlds themselves. When the war with the Empire finally came to end, the Republic and the Imperial remnants signed the Galactic Concordance and the Republic passed the Military Disarmament Act. The end of Mothma's chancellery brought a close to a period of unity in the Republic, with several political factions, such as the Centrists and the Populists, breaking out in disagreement over the best future for the new government.
            Mon Mothma was born in 46 BBY into a political family; her father was an arbiter-general in the Galactic Republic, and her mother was a governor on their homeworld of Chandrila.[2]
            In 32 BBY, she joined the Republic's Galactic Senate.[11] In the Chandrilan winter of 31 BBY, at the age of fifteen, Mothma fell in love, discovered smashball and her parents' imperfections. Because of that, she decided to turn her back on her family's political dynasty to become a historian. By the next summer, however, her moment of rebellion had been forgotten. She ended up returning to politics, both because of family pressures and a genuine love of governance.[12] In 27 BBY,[13] she became one of the youngest senators to date.[2]
            She became a member of the Loyalist Committee, a group of senators tasked by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine to maintain the integrity of the Republic during the political crisis that saw the formation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.[1] After the Clone Wars broke out between the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic and the Droid Army of the Separatist Alliance, Mothma remained a member of the Loyalist Committee but became an outspoken opponent of the war with the Separatists. Mothma, along with friends and allies like Senators Padmé Amidala of Naboo and Bail Organa of Alderaan, came to fear that the Republic's push to defeat the Separatists made it blind to the toll that the war would take on the Republic. She warned that wartime measures, such as the increasing scope of the emergency powers that the Galactic Senate gave the chancellor, were a threat to democracy. It was the desire of Mothma and her allies to find a peaceful solution to the Clone Wars, and Mothma served as a mentor to Amidala as the young senator became one of the leading advocates for peace in the Republic.[14]
            During the Battle of Malastare, the Grand Army of the Republic discovered a creature known as the Zillo Beast that dwelled underneath the surface of the planet Malastare. Having been given a way to the surface by the bombardments during the battle, the Zillo Beast fought against the Republic Army, and it was discovered that the creature was nearly-indestructible.[15] In the hopes of replicating the indestructibility for use in clone trooper armor, Chancellor Palpatine approved the creature's relocation to Coruscant, the capital of the Republic. The Zillo Beast escaped from captivity and made its way towards the Senate Office Building to find the chancellor, who had ordered the beast be destroyed so its indestructible scales could be removed for testing and replication. The creature attacked the Senate Office Building, and Mothma was present during the attack, walking the corridors of power with Senator Organa. The Republic and the Jedi soon eliminated the creature, bringing an end to the threat against the Senate.[16]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mon_Mothma</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMonMothma</string></dict>
        <key>Reija Momen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.301.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Reija Momen was a Human female from Alderaan, middle-aged as of 22 BBY. Anakin Skywalker believed she resembled his mother.
            When Momen was young, her father took out a loan from the InterGalactic Banking Clan to help the mortgage on the family farm. When bad harvests made him unable to pay it back, the Clan confiscated their holdings, requiring the family to move to the city. This led to her father's depression and eventual death, and left Reija with a lasting hatred of Muuns.
            In 27 BBY, Reija was made chief administrator of the Intergalactic Communications Center, due to the fact she liked the job as opposed to the large salary. The workers at the Communications Center referred to her as "Momma Momen." She considered eventually retiring to start a family on Alderaan.
            After being taken hostage by Pors Tonith during the Battle of Praesitlyn, Tonith used Momen to send a message to the Republic, demanding Republic forces evacuate Praesitlyn or the Separatists would start killing hostages. Momen read the message, but against orders, she ordered the Republic to attack. She was rescued by Anakin Skywalker, only to be shot by a battle droid and die in his arms, having shielded him from the blast.
            Because of her physical resemblance to Shmi Skywalker, Anakin found himself reliving his mother's death. Momentarily tapping into the dark side of the Force, he proceeded to cut a swath of destruction through Tonith's security forces and nearly killed the Separatist admiral before being stopped by the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Reija_Momen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemReijaMomen</string></dict>
        <key>Elise Montagne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.302.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elise Montagne was a Human female who lived on an estate north of the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine during the time of the Jedi Civil War. She developed an unhealthy attraction to her husband's protocol droid C8-42-GE3 after his death, prompting the droid to eventually run away from his home and owner.
            Revan first met her on the plains just outside the Jedi Enclave, where she stopped him and begged his help in finding her "companion". Revan eventually discovered that the dear companion she was searching for was in fact a droid, but despite being a little unnerved by her mannerisms he agreed to find it for her.
            Revan eventually discovered the run away droid and saved it from a vicious Kath Hound attack, only to discover that it had been intentionally trying to destroy itself. C8-42-GE3 explained to Revan that Elise had become obsessed with him and wanted to treat him like her dead husband, which was making her increasingly isolated and insular.
            Concerned for her state of mind—and a little unnerved by her affections—, he came to the conclusion that she would only get better if he was no longer there.
            Revan then destroyed C8-42 at his request, so that Elise would move on with her life.
            When Revan returned and relayed to her what had happened she was grief-stricken and ran back to the Jedi Enclave, where ironically she met a man named Samnt, and the two of them became close very quickly. At their last meeting Elise thanked Revan for his help, finally admitting that she had been using her droid as a way to cope with her husband's death. She apologized for the way she had been behaving before, and she and her new man left.
            There was initially no canonical establishment on what Revan did with the droid since there are many alternatives in the game. The surname Montagne stands for "Mountain" in French.
            If the player tells Elise that the droid was nowhere to be found, she runs out onto the dangerous plains to find him. This is a definite dark-side-oriented action, and most members of your party will give the player criticism for their actions, except the two droids and Canderous.
            In another alternative dark side ending, instead of promising to C8-42 to explain to Elise why he had chosen to be destroyed, Revan tells the droid that he would destroy him and tell Elise that he never found him instead. Shocked at his cruelty, the harmless droid becomes enraged and attacks him, and is easily destroyed. Doing this, however, has no effect on what the player later chooses to tell Elise.
            In another alternative ending to the mission, Revan ordered the droid to return to Elise. C8-42 reluctantly complied. Elise was very grateful for the return of her droid and doesn't meet Samnt.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Elise_Montagne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemEliseMontagne</string></dict>
        <key>Morgana Onasi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.303.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Morgana Onasi was the wife of Carth Onasi and the mother of Dustil Onasi.
            Carth served in the Galactic Republic military during the Mandalorian Wars, leaving Morgana and Dustil on their own. At the end of the war, Carth came back to Telos with the intention of forever being with his family. However, at the outset of the Jedi Civil War Carth reenlisted, feeling that the Republic needed him. Morgana hated this choice, but accepted it.
            During the war, Telos came under attack by the Sith fleet. Admiral Saul Karath, ordered by Darth Malak, bombarded the planet from orbit as proof of his change of allegiance. Carth arrived with a Republic contingent soon after the bombing to find Morgana near death and Dustil missing. He held her and screamed for the medics, but she died before they arrived.
            When Carth and Dustil met two years later in the Sith Academy on Korriban, Dustil cited the failure of the Republic in general, and Carth in specific, to protect Morgana as a reason for his turn to the dark side.
            According to Carth, Morgana was courageous and stubborn. Carth said that he could never talk her out of anything she set her mind to.
            In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Carth Onasi's wife went unnamed. David Gaider, who worked on the game as a writer, was the first to identify her as "Morgana,"[2] and this name was later canonized in the  Knights of the Old Republic Handbook.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Morgana_Onasi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMorganaOnasi</string></dict>
        <key>Kea Moll</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.304.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kea Moll was a Human female member of an anti-Imperial resistance cell on the Outer Rim planet Annoo during the early years of the Galactic Empire. Born on Annoo around 32 BBY, Moll followed her parents into the resistance at the age of fifteen after she witnessed the atrocities committed by the Empire on her homeworld and other planets. In 15 BBY, Moll's mother, Demma, sent her to the planet Ingo to destroy the Trigon One, a powerful weapons satellite under construction by the Fromm Gang criminal organization as part of a power play against their rival gangs. After she witnessed the kidnapping of Ingoian speeder racer Jord Dusat by the Fromm Gang, Moll helped Dusat's racing partner, Thall Joben, and the pair's droids, C-3PO and R2-D2, rescue Dusat from the secret base operated by gang leader Sise Fromm's son, Tig.
            Moll agreed to transport her new friends to the Boonta Speeder Race, but a hyperdrive malfunction forced them to seek repairs on Annoo. After they learned of Moll's mission, Joben and Dusat agreed to help her. Moll, Joben and the droids hid aboard Sise Fromm's starship as it headed for Tig Fromm's base, from where they stole the Trigon One. The Fromms later captured Dusat and Demma Moll, and used them to force Joben to reveal where he had hidden the stolen starship. However, Joben had sabotaged the vessel; when Tig Fromm returned it to Annoo, the guidance systems malfunctioned, and it was sent on a collision course with Sise Fromm's stronghold. Moll and Joben rescued Dusat and Demma from the base moments before it was destroyed.
            Despite the Fromm Gang's attempts to exact revenge, Moll and her friends finally reached the planet Boonta, where Joben raced to victory in the Boonta Speeder Race. His win attracted the attention of Zebulon Dak, owner of Zebulon Dak Speeder Corporation, who offered the group jobs in his organization. Unknown to her friends, Dak was himself a resistance operative and had recruited Moll to spy on manufacturing plants loyal to the Empire. Moll later joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic and, after the Alliance evolved into the New Republic, became a founding member of the New Republic Intelligence Service.
            A native of Annoo,[1] a planet in the Outer Rim Territories,[5] the Human female Kea Moll[1] was born around 32 BBY[2] and was raised by her mother, Demma, and her father on the family farm on her homeworld. The young Moll spent many hours working with her father on his ship, a Corellian Engineering Corporation Starrunner-class starship called the Sand Sloth, until she was fully acquainted with its systems. She took up piloting at an early age, using the spare time that farm life left her to practice her flying, and eventually became an accomplished pilot.[1]
            In 19 BBY,[6] when Moll was around thirteen years old,[2] Galactic Republic Supreme Chancellor Palpatine declared himself Emperor of a new Galactic Empire.[7] Moll's parents were among those opposed to Imperial rule and subsequently joined a local resistance cell[1]—setting up a base of operations in a concealed room with a hidden entrance from the farm's sand sloth stables[8]—but they kept their involvement with the resistance a secret from Moll in order to protect her. However, her father was killed in a failed mission against an Imperial target and, when Moll was fifteen years old, her mother revealed the truth to her. Having witnessed for herself many of the atrocities committed by the Empire both on Annoo and other worlds, Moll decided to join her mother's organization and assist in their fight against the Empire.[1]
            The Empire was not the only group to which the Annoo resistance was opposed. The criminal syndicate known as the Fromm Gang was based on Annoo, and its leader, Sise Fromm, used fear to maintain control over a number of planets near the Annoo system.[1] The Fromm Gang also sought to take possession of the Moll family farm.[9] In 15 BBY, the resistance discovered that the Fromm Gang was constructing a powerful weapons satellite, the Trigon One,[1] in the secret base maintained by Sise Fromm's son, Tig, on the planet Ingo. The Fromms planned to use the new weapon to take over their rival gangs,[3] and the resistance feared that the Trigon One would pose a threat to the galaxy in the wrong hands. Aged only seventeen, Moll was sent on her first solo mission: to travel to Ingo and destroy the Trigon One.[1]
            Taking the Sand Sloth—her ship of choice following her father's death—Moll made her way to Tig Fromm's base in the Vaj Desert on Ingo.[1] While she surveilled the facility, Moll saw two landspeeders, piloted by the local racing team of Thall Joben and Jord Dusat, accompanied by their droids C-3PO and R2-D2, pass into the base's restricted security zone. The automated defenses launched seeker probes after the intruders, and Moll realized that the racers would be killed if she did not intervene. Joben was able to evade his pursuers, although C-3PO was thrown clear of his speeder during the chase. As Joben raced to help Dusat, who had been forced to abandon his speeder as the seeker probes destroyed it, a sentry droid approached C-3PO and prepared to fire a seeker probe at the droid.[3] Moll quickly equipped her sawed-off blaster cannon[1] and destroyed the sentry droid before it could fire. The two racers soon returned in Joben's speeder to retrieve C-3PO, and the entire group left before more droids arrived, unaware of Moll's help.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kea_Moll</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKeaMoll</string></dict>
        <key>Mira</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.305.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mira was a female Human bounty hunter and one of the Lost Jedi from the moon Nar Shaddaa, serving as one of the followers of Meetra Surik, the Jedi Exile during her search for lost Jedi Masters in 3951 BBY.
            Mira was born in 3974 BBY.[2] As Mandalorians raided worlds on the Outer Rim during the Mandalorian Wars, Mira was taken in as a slave when her home was sacked. Mira was raised by the Mandalorians from a young age but they later accepted her into a Mandalorian squad, and she was taught how to fight, hunt, and survive like a Mandalorian, and was treated as a part of the unit. However, at the age of fourteen, the Battle of Malachor V erupted. Mira lost her adopted family when the Mass Shadow Generator activated.
            With the Mandalorians crushed at Malachor V, the Galactic Republic was flooding with refugees, and many of them—including Mira—ended up in the refugee sector of Nar Shaddaa. To survive in the hostile environment, she became a bounty hunter. While she worked for credits, she recognized that the Mandalorian Wars left people scattered and lost. Her wish was to find these people and begin to piece the galaxy back together and then perhaps find herself or a new family. Her provocative clothing was a device to distract male opponents so that she could defeat them and check any outstanding bounties on them. Unlike other bounty hunters, who enjoyed killing their victims, Mira believed that a good bounty hunter did not need to kill their targets—especially if they knew their targets well. Despite her strange beliefs, she soon became successful, and that success predictably led her enemies to envy. Eventually, she gained the attention of an unknown being who employed the Wookiee Hanharr to hunt her.
            Hanharr planned to ambush Mira in vents beneath the Nar Shaddaa docks and drive her into some mines he placed in escape tunnels, but Mira outwitted him by remotely disabling the mines and re-enabling them when Hanharr was pursuing her. Hanharr survived the explosion—barely—and begged Mira to end his torment by killing him. However, Mira felt pity for him and saved his life. Unknown to Mira, this caused Hanharr to owe Mira a Wookiee life debt.
            According to the Wookiee code, a Wookiee should pledge a life debt to his savior. However, Hanharr possessed a hatred for humans so extreme that it drove him to insanity. While Hanharr respected the life debt he owed to Mira, his madness caused his interpretation of that life debt to become twisted and evil. Hanharr considered it a form of 'living death' to owe a life debt to a human such as Mira. Consequently Hanharr focused all of his hatred for humanity upon Mira and instead of guarding Mira's life, Hanharr continually hunted Mira and threatened to kill her. Hanharr would often stalk Mira, grab her by the throat and promise to derive pleasure from killing her sometime in the future, when the time was right. Mira often told Hanharr that she didn't want his life debt but Hanharr's insanity meant that he could see no way out other than to kill Mira.
            The conflict reached its culmination when Goto, an elusive crime lord, announced Meetra Surik's arrival on Nar Shaddaa. Hanharr, as well as a number of other bounty hunters, started looking for Surik, each hoping to receive the bounty Goto had put for every remaining Jedi. Mira, however, was hired by Zez-Kai Ell – who was a former Jedi Master and Council member living in self-imposed exile on Nar Shaddaa – to secretly watch over Surik and keep Goto off her back until he could speak with her.
            Mira tracked Surik's actions, who was helping Nar Shaddaa's refugees and undermining the Exchange's business. When Visquis, the local Exchange boss, tried to lure Surik into a trap in the Jekk'Jekk Tarr, Mira stole her envirosuit (which was supposed to protect Surik from the Jekk'Jekk Tarr's atmosphere, toxic to Humans) and allowed Visquis to capture her. Unknown to her, however, Hanharr had collaborated with the Quarren. While Surik was trapped in the Jekk'Jekk Tarr tunnels, Visquis allowed Hanharr to kill Mira in his arena. However, Mira proved herself tough to kill. She defeated Hanharr and left him apparently dead in the arena, and fought her way through Visquis's Ubese bounty hunters, and let Surik in, escaping through the tunnels herself. After that, Mira joined the Ebon Hawk crew in their quest to free Surik from Goto's yacht.
            She remained loyal to Surik, accompanying her during her adventures on the Ebon Hawk. However, in Surik's presence, she did not hold back and killed her opponents though she did not understand why. Surik recognized the Force-sensitivity in Mira when she described the natural flow of life on Nar Shaddaa, Surik taught Mira to feel and use the Force on Nar Shaddaa, allowing her to become a Jedi Sentinel. Because she was unused to feeling the Force, Mira was initially overwhelmed by all the rush of life and activity, but Surik helped her to learn to shut it out and calm her mind.
            On Malachor V, Mira confronted and defeated an enemy she did not expect to ever meet again: Hanharr, who had been saved from death by Kreia on the proviso that Hanharr continue to hunt down and kill Mira. Despite being on his knees defeated, Hanharr's irrational hatred for Mira remained because she once saved his life. With Hanharr's hate fueled madness not in the least bit diminished, Hanharr begged Mira to kill him because he would rather die than endure the 'living death' he would suffer again if Mira spared his life a second time. Tired of constantly having to live her life in fear and realizing that Hanharr would always hunt her for the rest of her life if allowed to live, Mira granted Hanharr's request to die and killed him. After the final confrontation with Surik, Darth Traya predicted that Mira would stop hunting life and instead live it. "She was not born to be a predator," said Darth Traya among her last words. "Her death will occur in many years time on a forgotten planet, saving the lives of others. But it will be her choice, and she will have no regrets."</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mira</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMira</string></dict>

        <key>Callista Ming</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.307.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Callista Ming, originally known as Callista Masana, was a Human Jedi Knight from the planet Chad during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. She was a member of a rogue sect of Jedi, led by Master Djinn Altis, who were accepted back by the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars to take command of clone troopers and fight for the Republic. During the war, she followed Altis into battle on the planet JanFathal alongside a contingent of clones and two orthodox Jedi, Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, in order to rescue a Republic Intelligence agent, Hallena Devis. After the war, Masana survived the initial stages of the Great Jedi Purge and made contact with other survivors on the planet Belsavis.
            When the automated Imperial dreadnaught Eye of Palpatine came to demolish the settlement, Masana and her lover Geith Eris launched a desperate mission to sabotage the ship. They were successful, but in the process, Masana shed her physical body, remaining embedded in the ship's computer as a spirit. Many years later, Luke Skywalker and several other Jedi were brought onto the ship as it resumed its mission. Masana, in spirit form, communicated and began to fall in love with Skywalker. She later took the body of one of the other Jedi, Cray Mingla, after Mingla gave it up to stop the superweapon once and for all. However, in the process, Masana, now using the surname "Ming," lost her ability to touch the Force.
            Despite this loss, Ming helped thwart Admiral Natasi Daala and the Death Seed plague conspiracy, though she and Skywalker parted ways forever. On her journey to rediscover the Force, Ming encountered the dark side entity Abeloth, who absorbed her life essence and took over her body. Abeloth then used Ming's spirit to reach out to Skywalker as he traveled to her, and tried to convince him that she was in fact Ming when he confronted her. Skywalker was surprised to realize how much he still loved Ming after so many years, but he was not fooled by Abeloth's trickery. After facing her numerous times, Skywalker was finally able to detach Ming from Abeloth and the physical world, causing her to disappear into the light side of the Force.
            Born on the water-world of Chad, the Force-sensitive female Human Callista Masana lived on an ark in a deep-water ranch with her father, stepmother, and an uncle named Claine; she also had an uncle named Dro. The ranch followed the planet's Algic current, ranging from the equator to the arctic circle. Masana's family was not wealthy, but they had a happy life, living mostly on the deep oceans as herders and farmers.[2] From her youth, Masana helped out on the ranch, herding tsaelke cetaceans and wander-kelp.[4] When the ranch was in the territory of the predatory wystoh and they needed to leave their floating home, the family sent out a foo-twitter, a floating device meant to distract the marine hunters. Masana also rode cy'een, fish native to the world. The first time Masana used the Force was to move some ice that had trapped her with several sea cows. Afterward, she knew she had to join the Jedi, but could never make her confused father understand why.[2]
            Rather than going through the normal process of separation from her parents and training in the Jedi Temple on the capital planet Coruscant, she was recruited into the Jedi Order by the maverick Jedi Master Djinn Altis in 25 BBY, who led a group called the Altisian Jedi. She trained under Altis for five years on his praxeum ship, the second Chu'unthor. Masana constructed a lightsaber, which bore a ring of stylized tsaelke sea-creatures around the hilt in token of her heritage. During a layover on the planet Bespin, she sensed Geith Eris' potential in the Force and asked him to come along with her. He did, though mostly to be with her, and the two fell in love.[7]
            During the Clone Wars, Masana and Eris journeyed with Master Djinn Altis and several other Jedi of their community. They traveled across the galaxy in a freighter, Wookiee Gunner, rendering humanitarian aid to various planets affected by the war. While heading to the planet Yarille on another relief mission, Masana advocated more directly aiding the Galactic Republic, stating that the presence of Altis' Jedi could make a difference, but Altis was reluctant to agree with her and Eris was opposed to the idea altogether. Before they reached Yarille, though, Wookiee Gunner picked up a distress signal from an undercover Republic Intelligence agent on JanFathal, Hallena Devis. Altis contacted a local Republic commander, Captain Gilad Pellaeon, whose ship, Leveler, was the nearest Republic warship, and offered the services of his Jedi in extracting Devis. Pellaeon, who was romantically involved with Devis, agreed to the Jedi offer.[5]
            In short order, Altis, Masana, Eris, and their other Jedi companions met with and boarded the Leveler. While on the Republic ship, Masana marveled at the complexity of the machinery and electrical systems it contained. She met a Togruta Jedi Padawan named Ahsoka Tano, and Masana made Eris—who fostered a keen dislike of the rules of the orthodox Jedi Order—promise not to antagonize the Padawan. Masana also met Captain Pellaeon, who freely admitted his own interest in rescuing Devis, but asked his officers and the Jedi to keep him accountable to his duty; she admired him for his admission and his hands-on approach to leadership.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Callista_Ming</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemCallistaMing</string></dict>

        <key>Marida Sumar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.313.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>In 4 BBY, Marida Sumar lived with her husband Morad on a farm on Lothal. The two were forced from their home by the Galactic Empire, who had originally wanted to buy it from them but, after Sumar refused the offer, destroyed it and took the couple prisoner. They were later rescued by Ezra Bridger and Garazeb Orrelios. By 2 BBY, Marida and her husband had joined a rebel cell led by Lothal's former Governor Ryder Azadi. She and her husband took part in a joint mission to infiltrate the Lothal Imperial Armory Complex. During the course of that mission, Marida lost her husband.
            Marida Sumar was a female human who lived during the Age of the Empire. In 4 BBY, she and her husband Morad Sumar owned a farm near the city of Kothal. Her husband made a living by selling jogan fruits at a stall in the Kothal market. That year, the Imperial Supply Master Yogar Lyste wanted to buy their farm but Morad refused to sell their livelihood to the Empire. Unwilling to let the matter rest, Lyste visited the farm with three Imperial Troop Transports and several stormtroopers. After razing the farm, Lyste loaded Marida, her husband, and their Aqualish helper onto the side compartments of a Troop Transport.[2]
            While traveling through the grassy plains of Lothal, the Sumars and their Imperial captors encountered a TIE fighter that had been commandeered by Ezra Bridger and Garazeb Orrelios, the former a friend of Marida's husband. While the Imperials exchanged fire with the rebel TIE fighter, Ezra managed to board the middle transport. Using the Force, he freed Marida, her husband, and their Aqualish servant from their restraints. Marida, Morad, and their servant then managed to flee into the plains while Ezra and Zeb engaged the Imperials and escaped with a crate of meiloorun fruit.[2]
            By 2 BBY, Marida and her husband Morad had joined a rebel cell headed by Ryder Azadi, the former Governor of Lothal. Their cell specialized in sabotaging vehicles produced by the Imperial Armory Complex in Capital City. Her husband Sumar used his position as a factory worker to sabotage various vehicles including 614-AvA speeder bikes and AT-DP walkers, causing the Empire to lose many personnel and missions. She, Morad, and the Ithorian bartender Jho were present when Ezra, his master Kanan Jarrus, and the rebel astromech droid Chopper visited Ryder's stone circle encampment.[4]
            When Marida and her comrades learned that Ezra and the Phoenix Cell were planning to take out the factory, they cheered. Since Ezra and his team planned to steal secret Imperial plans for a new secret weapon, her husband Morad agreed to help them infiltrate the factory using his position as a worker there. The following day, Morad and Ezra's team departed on their mission. However, Morad was killed when Grand Admiral Thrawn, who had been dispatched by Imperial High Command to investigate the high rate of faulty vehicles at the Lothal factory, forced him to test a faulty 614-AvA speeder bike.[4]
            After losing contact with Ezra's team, Marida accompanied Ryder on a diversionary attack on the factory's east gate. Marida used her rocket launcher to damage an Imperial Troop Transport. In response, the Imperials sent two AT-AT walkers to engage them. Ezra's team managed to escape the factory in a stolen AT-DP walker but were attacked by the AT-ATs. Marida used her rocket launcher to hit the foreleg of the AT-AT walker that was crushing the rebels' AT-DP walker. She and Ryder were pleasantly surprised when Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper emerged from the hatch of the AT-AT. Marida bowed her head in sadness when Ezra informed her that her husband Sumar had not survived the mission. After returning to Ryder's base on their two landspeeders, the rebels discovered that Thrawn had been developed a prototype starfighter that was equipped with deflector shields.[4]
            Later, Marida and Ryder were patronizing Old Jho's Pit Stop when they received a HoloNet transmission of the former Imperial Senator Mon Mothma's speech urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion against the Empire.[3]
            In 1 BBY, Marida and Ryder survived an Imperial crackdown which claimed the life of Jho. After Ryder informed the Rebel Alliance about the new TIE/D Defender Elite, the Spectres smuggled themselves in Lothal with the help of the crimelord Cikatro Vizago. After the Spectres evaded Imperial forces through Lothal's sewers, Marida and Ryder ferried them to safety in their U-wing.[5]
            Marida Sumar was a human woman with blue eyes and copper skin. She wore a white scarf around her head over a brown and white top.[2] After joining Ryder's rebel cell, Marida learned how to fire a rocket launcher. She was visibly saddened after learning that her husband Morad did not survive an undercover mission at the Lothal Imperial factory.[4]
            Marida Sumar first appeared as a minor background character in the Star Wars Rebels Season One episode "Fighter Flight", which premiered on WatchDisneyXD.com on October 13, 2014. She returned to the series in Star Wars Rebels Season Three Episode 9, which was titled "An Inside Man". In the episode, she received speaking lines for the first time. These lines were performed by Vanessa Marshall, who also voices Hera Syndulla on the series.[4] Despite the character's name already being established, Sumar is identified only as "Female Citizen" in the episode's end credits.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Marida_Sumar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMaridaSumar</string></dict>

Her older sister learned to survive on her own after the Droid Gotra caused a gang dispute on the planet Eshan and imparted her survival lessons to her younger sister. Maxa rode a Vulptereen Skysnipe-616D during shipjacking raids.[1]
            While she was a member, the Cloud-Riders attempted to steal a shipment of coaxium from the Galactic Empire on the planet Vandor. Riding speeder bikes, they attacked a 20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport carrying the goods, but discovered that a group working for the criminal Crimson Dawn were already on the transport trying to steal the same shipment. The groups fought and ultimately neither managed to claim the coaxium as it was destroyed. During the raid Tobias Beckett shot at Maxa's swoop bike, causing her to lose control of the vehicle and crash into the side of the mountain, perishing in the ensuing explosion.[3]
            Moda Maxa was skilled in the Echani martial arts and trained with her sister Tayshin to improve their combat skills.

        <key>Malarus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.319.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Malarus was a human female who served as a commander in the First Order around 34 ABY. She arrested the First Order Security Bureau Agent Terex after he undertook a rogue mission to destroy the Resistance.
            After the First Order Security Bureau Agent Terex defied Captain Phasma's warnings not to embark on a rogue mission to destroy the Resistance,[2] the First Order dispatched Commander Malarus to punish Terex. Malarus brought a Maxima-A class heavy cruiser and several TIE/fo space superiority fighters to the desert planet that Terex had pursued Poe Dameron to. Malarus' space forces wiped out the Ranc gang's fleet of "Uglies" and destroyed Terex's flagship Carrion Spike.[1]
            Malarus then led an Atmospheric Assault Lander and a contingent of stormtroopers and TIE fighters to the planet's surface. She greeted Dameron and his droid BB-8 as he emerged from the cave with the disabled C-3PO and a dejected Terex. After exchanging pleasantries, Dameron warned Malarus that his Black Squadron was capturing footage of their meeting in case she ordered her men to gun him down. Malarus complimented Dameron for his political savvy before ordering him to hand over Terex. Dameron complied but told Terex about his defeat before dragging Terex towards Malarus.[1] Malarus, Terex and her stormtroopers then boarded the bulk freighter Romary. There, she questioned Captain Perrili about her connections to the Resistance. Despite Perrili's claims about her business just being business, Malarus ordered her to be shot and Romary rigged to explode. She then ordered their tanker to siphon the Romary's fuel supply.[3] Malarus then took the Enshado to a hyperspace ring. There, she and the Enshado were confronted by Dameron, who demanded they leave without the Romary's fuel or they would blow up the Romary. Malarus told her forces to hold off Dameron's forces as the Enshado made their way to the hyperspace ring. Unfortunately, Dameron's forces destroyed the ring. Malarus, knowing they were under orders to avoid a direct confrontation with the Resistance, had the tanker's crew abandon the tanker. Malarus then made sure to set the tanker on self-destruct. Unfortunately, only the Romary blew up, and Dameron's forces took the tanker.[4]
            Malarus then spoke to Terrex about Dameron. She and Terex then went to Abednedo to capture Oddy Muva. After capturing Muva, she told his wife, Sowa Chuan, to tell Dameron about her husband's capture.[5] Aboard a transport, Malarus had Terex interrogate Muva for information on the Resistance. She was then informed that X-wings were coming their way and that another officer had captured Jessika Pava, Kare Kun and their team at Spalex.[6] Malarus then had Dameron and Wexley taken aboard the Enshado. She then took the Enshado to Spalex to capture the rest of Black Squadron. She then ordered Terex to kill Muva, seeing him as dead weight. However, Terex released Muva, who then helped Dameron and Wexley escape. Malarus and Terex then took a Xi-class light shuttle to Spalex to finish off the last of Black Squadron. They were stopped by Dameron and Wexley in their X-wings. Malarus then watched as Muva made a suicide run on the Enshado and then made her escape into hyperspace.[7]
            Malarus then went to Cato Neimoidia using Dameron's own X-wing,[8] where she went head to head with Dameron. During their dogfight, Malarus did not care about civilian casualties. As she went in for the kill, Dameron's astromech, BB-8, took control of the fighter. After BB-8 was picked up by Dameron, Malarus crashed. She was confronted by an official of House Reya, who arrested her and said they would give her a trial.[9]
            Malarus was a tall blonde human woman with an amber right eye. Her left eye was artificially black due to the introduction of a naturally occurring narcotic.[1] The narcotic also promoted her body-mass growth and intelligence, and retarded her aging.[5] She tied her hair into a tight bun. Malarus complimented Resistance pilot Poe Dameron for his savvy.[1]
            Malarus first appeared in the 2017 comic book Poe Dameron 13: The Gathering Storm, Part VI, which was written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Phil Noto.[1] When creating Malarus, Soule asked Noto to model the character after actress Brigitte Nielsen's character from the film Rocky IV.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malarus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMalarus</string></dict>

        <key>Magna Tolvan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.321.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Magna Tolvan was a female human who served as a captain in the Galactic Empire's military during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Yavin and the Rebel Alliance's subsequent evacuation of their base on Yavin 4, Tolvan was in command of Imperial forces as they investigated the now-deserted base. She was later demoted to Lieutenant and briefly stationed on an Imperial base on Someilk, before being re-assigned to the Inspectorate, as Lieutenant-Inspector on Coruscant. After her success at crippling the criminal organization Son-tuul Pride, however, Tolvan regained the rank of captain. 
            Magna Tolvan joined the Galactic Empire sometime before 0 BBY. In the Imperial Academy, her classmates thought she was the most likely to succeed.[5] At one point, Admiral Kendal Ozzel considered her "a candidate for greatness" and she eventually reached the rank of captain. Under the command of General Cassio Tagge, she was responsible for the security on Eadu,[6] a planet that hosted a research and development facility of the Tarkin Initiative.[7] In 0 BBY,[8] however, a band of Rebels sent to assassinate the scientist Galen Erso wreaked havoc at the facility,[9] which Tolvan could not prevent.[6] By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Tolvan was under the apprenticeship of Inspector Thanoth. He once told her that nothing happened without a good cause.[5] Thanoth, however, died during his final assignment.
            Although Tagge proved to be a rather forgiving superior toward Tolvan, she was still assigned to a punishment duty on the uninhabited moon Yavin 4. There, the captain was to comb the Great Temple, which had been the Rebels' main base until they were forced to evacuate. On Yavin 4, a lieutenant informed Tolvan of readings they had picked up, theorizing the possible presence of rebels. The infiltrators at hand were not rebels but Chelli Aphra, her father, Black Krrsantan, and the droids BT-1 and 0-0-0, who were there to take readings from the temple. Tolvan sent out speeders but Krrsantan shot them down. She saw this from afar and ordered her forces to move out and respond to this threat.[1]
            As they reached the temple, Krrsantan opened-fire on Tolvan's forces with a heavy blaster cannon he obtained from a walker.[1] Inside the temple, Aphra and the rest of her team collected the readings they wanted and began to leave, engaging Imperial troops along the way. Tolvan then managed to trap them between her and her stormtroopers, and an AT-AT. She ordered them to drop their weapons and her troopers prepared to fire. However, Aphra's ship, the Ark Angel II, then intervened and picked them up while destroying the AT-AT.[6]
            Wanting to redeem herself, Tolvan and her remaining troops, now equipped as snowtroopers, followed Aphra to the Citadel of Rur, marching through the entrance past the hidden 0-0-0 and BT-1. Aphra, her father and Krrsantan were walking along the edge of the citadel when Tolvan's forces arrived. Krrsantan covered his comrades as ran for cover along a Force bridge. Aphra then shot the device controlling the bridge and three pursuing snowtroopers fell to their doom.[10]
            Tolvan and her troops were unable to cross the void and pursue Aphra,[10] but had bigger concerns when a large number of droids attacked them, gradually massacring the snowtroopers. Aphra then appeared again and told them to follow her. Tolvan did so and Aphra had the Force-bridge generate again and deactivate when Tolvan was across. They then retreated back to Tolvan's ship to find the pilots had been slaughtered by 0-0-0 and BT-1. In addition, an Imperial droid was being possessed by the conscience of a dead ancient Jedi and attacked Tolvan. Nevertheless, the group escaped the citadel before it exploded and the droid was freed from the technopathy.[11]
            Tolvan got up and threatened to shoot Aphra with her blaster. However, Aphra's father stabbed her in the shoulder with Rur's lightsaber, effectively subduing her. Tolvan was then left stranded on a planet in the Outer Rim; Aphra acknowledged that she should kill Tolvan, but decided not to, due to her attraction to Tolvan.[11]
            Following her run-in with Aphra, Tolvan was once again demoted. As a Lieutenant, she was assigned to an Imperial base on the planet Someilk in the Outer Rim. Tolvan's new superior, Captain Punfor, taunted her about her demotion, recalling her "high flying days" at the academy. After she reflected on her failures and wondered what advice her old mentor, Thanoth would give her.[5]
            To her surprise, an Orbital Insertion pod landed on the base, deploying a number of armed criminals. Tolvan warned Punfor of the attack told him to lock down the base and not deploy stormtroopers. Stormtroopers, however, responded to the attack anyway and were mowed down by the mercenary Rexa Go. Tolvan tried to flank them when she spotted Aphra. Shocked by her reappearance, of Tolvan and shot at her, but Go fired at her, pinning her down. After consulting a new plan with Punfor, Tolvan attempted to take control of the base's LAAT/le gunship, but was apprehended by Aphra and held at gunpoint.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Magna_Tolvan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMagnaTolvan</string></dict>

        <key>Mahwi Lihnn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.325.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mahwi Lihnn was a female Human bounty hunter who was active during the waning years of the Galactic Republic.
            In 42 BBY Mahwi Lihnn was forced to leave her homeworld after killing a corrupt government official. She soon took up bounty hunting. During her ten years of bounty hunting before 32 BBY, Mahwi Lihnn pursued bounties on Ord Mantell, Roon, Tatooine, and other worlds.
            In 32 BBY, Lihnn was hired by Rune Haako of the Trade Federation to rein in and bring back the "traitorous" Hath Monchar. Monchar had gone missing, much to the displeasure and slight worry of Darth Sidious. Sidious suspected that Monchar, who knew of the Trade Federation's upcoming blockade of Naboo, was treacherous and prepared to leak the sensitive plans.
            Lihnn would track down Hath Monchar, but it would prove to be her last bounty hunt. Visiting Coruscant for her first—and last—time, Lihnn searched Monchar's Kaldani Spires Residential apartment before tracking him to the Dewback Inn. Following the cloaked figure of Darth Maul, who was in turn following Monchar, Lihnn came to the Neimoidian's domicile only to find him already slain by Darth Maul. Maul, apprentice to Darth Sidious, had been dispatched by Sidious to kill Monchar and anybody he talked to. When the two hunters, knowing nothing of the other's parallel mission, encountered each other, Lihnn pulled her BlasTech DL-44 heavy blaster pistols on Maul. She held the upper hand with Maul backed into a corner, but the Sith used the Force to distract Lihnn by hurling a fallen bodyguard's blaster at her. Lihnn recovered quickly and fired at Maul as he ignited his double-bladed lightsaber. With the dark side of the Force guiding his every move, Maul reflected multiple shots back at the bounty hunter. However, none of the blaster bolts could penetrate Lihnn's shell spider silk armor. Despite this, Lihnn soon grew desperate and prepared to fire an wrist-mounted rocket. Maul, recognizing the devastation such a blast could cause, fled the scene by slicing through the adjacent wall and down through the floor. Lihnn realized as the rocket fired that the Sith had escaped and attempted to jump back into the hallway. Too late, the blast of the explosion slammed Lihnn halfway through the far wall and messily ended the career—and life—of the female bounty hunter.
            Mahwi Lihnn first appeared in the novel Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter.
            Mahwi Lihnn is voiced by Roger Jackson in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds. She appears as a hero for the Trade Federation in the game's level editor. Like all the bounty hunter units of that faction, she is portrayed here as a white-skinned humanoid with a strange, high-pitched voice.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mahwi_Lihnn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMahwiLihnn</string></dict>
        <key>Maris Magneta</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.326.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Maris Magneta was a Human female who served as chief of the Royal Naboo Security Forces under King Ars Veruna of Naboo. After Veruna first abdicated in 33 BBY, then was assassinated, Magneta stepped down; the new regent, Padmé Amidala, replaced her with Captain Quarsh Panaka. Although she didn't know how Veruna was assassinated, she did eventually find out that a Muunilinst businessman named Hego Damask and "his puppet" Palpatine were involved in the assassination.
            Before the Invasion of Naboo, Maris had learned of Damask's involvement, but she was later brutally murdered by Darth Maul, who broke her neck. Maul—upon reflection, which left him disillusioned concerning points of 'contract' and 'honor'—was shocked that his Master, Darth Sidious, would apparently break the millennia-old Sith Rule of Two by taking on his own apprentice while two Sith Lords yet lived and were seemingly bound to one another by that ancient dark covenant.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Maris_Magneta</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMarisMagneta</string></dict>

        <key>Lucia  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.328.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lucia was a Human female trooper who fought for the Brotherhood of Darkness during the New Sith Wars. She served as a sniper in the Gloom Walkers unit under the command of Lieutenant Ulabore, and took part in the Battle of Phaseera. Lucia defended Sergeant Dessel's mutinous actions during the battle, as she believed he had saved the unit's lives; however, Dessel was arrested anyway. Believing Dessel to have been court-martialed and killed due to Ulabore's order of arrest, Lucia killed Ulabore during a skirmish on Alaris Prime. After the end of the war, Lucia became a prisoner of war, until the Republic Senate issued an official pardon to the troopers who had served the Sith.
            After being released, Lucia served as a bodyguard and bounty hunter, and in 987 BBY she became the bodyguard of Serra, a nurse who saved her life after her failed attempt to capture the Meerian Salto Zendar. Serra later married Prince Gerran of Doan, and Lucia was inducted into the Doan Royal Guard. When Gerran was later killed by the planet's mining caste, Lucia hired the Huntress to assassinate the miners' leader. Soon after, Serra learned of her father's death, and ordered Lucia to contact the Huntress to capture Darth Bane, mistakenly believing him to be her father's killer.
            The Huntress succeeded in her task, and Bane was taken to the Stone Prison, where he was interrogated by Serra, with Lucia and the Huntress accompanying her. Lucia was shocked to recognize Bane as Dessel, and, believing she owed him her life for his action during the New Sith Wars, Lucia freed the Sith Lord. She then hurried to find Serra, hoping to get her to safety before Bane could find her. Lucia first saw Bane and confronted him, begging him to spare Serra. Lucia was killed, however, when Bane's apprentice, Darth Zannah, arrived and attacked them, hoping to take from Bane the title of Dark Lord of the Sith.
            The Human female Lucia was born sometime between 1030 and 1020 BBY, and she served in the Brotherhood of Darkness during the New Sith Wars against the Galactic Republic in the years leading up to the Seventh Battle of Ruusan. Lucia served as a junior officer and sniper in the Gloom Walkers unit, under the command of Lieutenant Ulabore.[1] She served alongside the trooper Dessel of the Gloom Walkers during the battle at Kashyyyk, and again during the battle at Hsskhor.[2] In 1002 BBY, Lucia and the Gloom Walkers participated in the Battle of Phaseera, an effort to capture the Republic manufacturing world of Phaseera. The Gloom Walkers were tasked with taking out a Republic outpost overlooking a valley that led to the Republic base camp in Phaseera's capital city. This outpost prevented the Brotherhood army from moving through the valley during the daytime without being spotted and their presence alerted to the Republic soldiers in the camp. In addition, the Republic had three flatbed gunships that could inflict massive damage from the sky.[1]
            Before the battle began, the Gloom Walkers stayed at a makeshift camp in the jungle. Ulabore eventually received the order from the Brotherhood's commanders to move out, and Lucia was sent to tell the rest of the troopers to assemble. However, when Ulabore told the Gloom Walkers that they were to attack the outpost in one hour, the Gloom Walkers objected, believing it to be a suicide mission. When Ulabore refused to listen, Dessel, who had been promoted to Sergeant, mutinied by knocking Ulabore out and taking command. The Gloom Walkers then waited until nightfall to strike and moved through the jungle, split into four squads, and encircled the outpost, with each squad using interference boxes to jam all transmissions within the perimeter.[1]
            Lucia was in Dessel's squad, and when Dessel saw that the crews of the now-grounded gunships were still there, he asked Lucia if she could snipe them. Lucia answered in the negative, stating that no one could kill so many troopers that fast. Frustrated and acting on impulse, Dessel attacked the crews by himself, killing several before being blinded by a flash canister. Dessel was able to retain his sight, even after the detonation of the flash canister, and went on to kill the rest of the Republic soldiers with incredible speed and precision. Lucia was very shocked by this display and stared with her mouth agape for a moment before continuing the fight for the outpost.[1]
            Three hours later, the Gloom Walkers succeeded in taking the outpost, with nine casualties. With the outpost eliminated, the main Brotherhood army was well on its way to surprise-attacking the Republic base camp. Lucia and the rest of the Gloom Walkers, save a small squad led by Senior Trooper Adanar that was tasked with holding the outpost, returned to their jungle camp to find an awake Ulabore surrounded by several Sith enforcers. Dessel was placed in shackles and told by Ulabore that he was going to be court-martialed. Although Lucia tried to defend Dessel, he was taken away by the armed enforcers.[1]
            A month later, Lucia and the Gloom Walkers traveled to Alaris Prime. On patrol there, they were ambushed by Republic troops—something that Lucia knew would never have happened had Dessel still been with them. The ensuing skirmish was quick and bloody; casualties were heavy on both sides, but the Republic troops were forced to flee. Lucia had not forgiven Ulabore for having Dessel arrested and likely killed, and she shot him in the back during the battle, killing him. The other Gloom Walkers never reported her betrayal, and Ulabore was registered as killed in action. However, unbeknownst to Lucia, Dessel's court-martial never occurred;[2] word had spread of his remarkable shooting, and he was taken to Korriban to train in the dark side of the Force. Dessel eventually became the Sith Lord Darth Bane. Two years after his arrest, he destroyed the Brotherhood by providing them with the thought bomb to use in battle against the Jedi. The war ended after the last battle on Ruusan, and Bane secretly established his own Order of the Sith Lords.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lucia_(soldier)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLucia</string></dict>

        <key>Lashowe</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.330.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lashowe was a young Force Adept who sided with the Sith Empire during the Jedi Civil War. Desiring power, influence and greater knowledge of the dark side, she aspired to become a full-fledged Sith student at the prestigious Korriban Academy. This goal was finally within her grasp when, shortly after harassing a newcomer to the Dreshdae colony, she became one of a small group of hopefuls selected to compete for the opportunity to undertake the “final test” that stood between prospective and true Sith students. To her surprise, the stranger she had encountered earlier was among that group and, like Lashowe herself, apprenticed to Yuthura Ban. Unbeknownst to her, however, he was in truth the reformed Dark Lord of the Sith, Revan. Determined to be the one to most impress Master Uthar Wynn, Lashowe uncovered the location of an ancient holocron in the Valley of the Dark Lords. Yet, outclassed by the man who had once ruled the Sith she so fervently hoped to join, Lashowe fell short of her ambitions and instead died at the hands of Revan in the Valley of the Dark Lords.
            Though Lashowe was sensitive to the Force and born after the Great Sith War, her later choice in friends suggested that she was not trained by the Jedi Order during the Restoration.[1][2] Even so, by 3956 BBY, her talents as a Force Adept had been recognized by the Sith Empire and she dwelt on Korriban, eager to prove herself worthy of full acceptance at the Sith Academy.[1]
            While loitering nearby the kiosk of the Rodian weapons merchant B'ree alongside a pair of fellows, Lashowe spotted a newcomer to Dreshdae. Determined to both intimidate and humiliate the stranger, who was in fact the reformed Sith Lord Revan, Lashowe —still but a promising hopeful, in truth[1][3]— aggrandized, identifying herself as one of the innumerable and powerful Sith of Korriban. Asserting that the former Dark Lord’s life was in her hands, Lashowe demanded that he amuse her if he wanted to live. Ultimately, the confrontation ended without violence and Lashowe and her companions returned to the Sith Academy.[1]
            Not long after, Lashowe was brought before the head Sith Master of the Academy, Uthar Wynn, as one of several candidates to become a fully initiated Sith student.[1][4] And there, standing alongside the more familiar faces of Mekel and Shaardan, was a “late entry”: the man she had accosted in Dreshdae. Revan had been nominated by Yuthura Ban, Wynn’s apprentice and second-in-command.   Yet, confident in her abilities and undaunted neither by the new arrival nor by Wynn’s line of questioning, Lashowe proclaimed herself ready to take her next great step down the dark path.
            Wynn explained to the candidates that they would each be competing to accumulate “prestige”, earning favor in his eyes by performing acts he deemed to be worthy of a Sith. Whoever impressed him the most would then undergo the “final test” in the tomb of Naga Sadow. Those left in the victor’s wake, assuming they even survived, would be forced to wait until the following year.
            Though Lashowe, like the other candidates, was assigned Ban as her teacher,[1][5] she soon learned of an age-old artifact of tremendous value: a holocron within the tomb of Tulak Hord. Utterly determined to be the one to win Master Wynn’s approval, Lashowe turned all her attention to its acquisition. Unfortunately, she soon discovered that the holocron lay within the gullet of a Tuk'ata mother and, as such, was effectively guarded by a pack of the vicious beasts. Undeterred, she began planning a strategy to deal with them.[1]
            While Lashowe worked at her dormitory’s en suite computer terminal she was approached by Revan. Though initially dismissive of the man, he proved persistent and, eventually, Lashowe told him of her designs upon an "artifact". To her surprise, he offered to help her recover it and, with some persuasion, Lashowe agreed to an alliance, finally revealing that the artifact was an ancient holocron. Plotting treachery, but trusting the intentions of her newfound partner, Lashowe did her best to assure Revan that Wynn would split prestige for the act between them. She then left for the Valley of the Dark Lords to begin preparations and await his arrival.
            Once she reached the entrance of Tulak Hord's tomb, Lashowe knelt before the resting place of the ancient Sith Lord. Using the Force, she began to call out to the Tuk'ata in their own "language", knowing that it would lure them out into a vulnerable position in the open. Yet, as time drew on, Lashowe still saw no sign of the aid she had been promised and, fearing what would happen were the Tuk'ata to attack her alone, she begrudgingly prepared to abandon her plan.[1][6]
            She was therefore immensely relieved when the help — Revan — finally did arrive, albeit mere moments before the Tuk'ata emerged from the tomb. Yet Lashowe and Revan together, fighting side by side, proved more than a match for the dark side creatures. Delighted by the victory and surprised by the ease by which they accomplished the task, Lashowe triumphantly plucked the Holocron from the dead Tuk'ata mother, fully intending to betray the man who had made it possible and claim all the credit for herself.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lashowe</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLashowe</string></dict>

        <key>Elscol Loro</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.332.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elscol Loro was a Human female resistance leader and New Republic starfighter pilot during the Galactic Civil War. A native of the Colonies planet Cilpar, Loro joined the Cilpari Resistance to oppose Imperial rule on her homeworld. Following the death of her husband, Throm Loro, at the hands of Imperial forces, Loro became leader of the Resistance and gained a constant companion and protector in the Wookiee Groznik, who transferred his life debt to Loro when Throm died. Despite her strong hatred of the Empire, Loro also distrusted the New Republic, believing them to be collaborating with Cilpar's Imperial government due to the actions of a traitor within the Resistance. Shortly after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the New Republic starfighter unit Rogue Squadron arrived on Cilpar. Loro initially took the Rebels captive, but came to trust them when they helped her to overthrow Moff Boren Tascl and expose the traitor.
            After the planet's liberation, Wedge Antilles invited Loro to join Rogue Squadron. She accepted, but her membership in the squadron proved to be brief. Following the death of Groznik during Rogue Squadron's mission to Mrlsst, Loro became increasingly insubordinate, disobeying Antilles's orders and taking unnecessary risks that placed herself and her wingmates in danger. After the squadron's mission to Tatooine, Antilles and Loro agreed that Rogue Squadron was not where she belonged. Loro left the New Republic to start her own resistance group, joining forces with former Special Intelligence operative Sixtus Quin and his squad, along with a handful of others who hated the Empire but were unwilling to join the Republic.
            Over the next few years Loro's group targeted Imperial worlds and worked to overthrow their planetary governments by training the local citizens to stage successful uprisings. In 7 ABY, Rogue Squadron resigned from the New Republic Defense Force to carry out an unsanctioned operation to free Thyferra from the rule of Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard. As Loro and her team specialized in such missions, Antilles contacted her and she agreed to assist him in overthrowing Isard. During the Battle of Thyferra at the end of the campaign, Loro led a team that stormed Xucphra Corporate Headquarters and captured Minister of Trade Fliry Vorru. Isard, however, escaped capture by faking her own death.
            The Human female Elscol Loro lived with her parents[2] and sister[4] in Tamarack, a town on the planet Cilpar[2] in the Colonies region of the galaxy,[5] during the Imperial era.[2] By 1 ABY, Elscol married Throm Loro,[6] a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a resistance group which was fighting a civil war against the ruling Galactic Empire. During the war, Throm was part of a team that liberated an Imperial base on the forest moon of Endor, during which he saved the life of the captive Wookiee Groznik, earning his loyalty in the process. Accompanied by Groznik, Throm later returned to Cilpar to fight the planet's Imperial governor, Moff Boren Tascl,[2] and he and Elscol became the leaders of the local anti-Imperial resistance group. Although the Cilpari Resistance had contacts in the Rebellion, they remained independent and received little assistance from the Alliance.[1]
            Loro's husband was killed fighting Imperial forces at the Battle of the Cliffs;[2] when he failed to return, Loro searched for him for two days before finding his body.[7] Groznik, who was with Throm when he died, transferred his life debt to his friend's widow and became a constant companion and protector.[2] Despite her loss, Loro attempted to hide her grief and continued the fight against Tascl, taking full command of the Cilpari Resistance.[8] After hearing of the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor[4] in 4 ABY,[9] Tascl destroyed two Cilpari settlements[4] where members of the Resistance were based, including Tamarack.[2] The attack resulted in the deaths of many family and supporters of the resistance fighters,[8] including Loro's sister[4] and parents—whose home took a direct hit. Refusing to believe that any of her people had betrayed their location, Loro blamed their contact in the Alliance—the only other person who knew where her organization was located.[2] The Rebels had been negotiating for Tascl's surrender before the attack[4] and Loro came to believe that the two sides had united against the Cilpari Resistance.[2]
            Soon after the destruction of Tamarack,[2] the Alliance's successor state,[10] the New Republic, dispatched the starfighter unit Rogue Squadron to Cilpar to escort a supply convoy to the planet Mrlsst. When Rogue Squadron were unable to locate the convoy, they established a base west of the city Kiidan while they attempted to make contact with either the Cilpari Resistance or "Targeter", the codename for Winter, a Rebel agent operating on the planet. Believing the new arrivals to be allied with Tascl, Loro led a squad to the Rebel base where they arrested Rogue Squadron pilots Dllr Nep, Plourr Ilo and Derek Klivian, along with their commanding officer, Captain Wedge Antilles. Despite Antilles's protests of innocence, the captive Rebels were loaded into the Cilpari's tank and taken to Tamarack, where Loro showed them the results of Tascl's attack. The group arrived to find the body of Gates Harnik, a local grocer who had been supplying the Rebels, hanging from a street light. After Loro's people cut the body down and cremated it, Loro searched the wreckage of her parents' home, looking for any holograms that had survived. Although she still did not trust him, Loro agreed to let Antilles help and the pair uncovered a "Starlight by Moonlight" music ball that had been given to her by Throm on the couple's third anniversary.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Elscol_Loro</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemElscolLoro</string></dict>

        <key>Camie Loneozner</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.334.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Camie Loneozner was a Human female who was a friend of Luke Skywalker at Anchorhead during the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. Her family managed an underground hydroponic garden on Tatooine, and bought most of their water from Owen Lars's farm. She hung out at Tosche Station with Janek "Tank" Sunber, Laze "Fixer" Loneozner, Biggs Darklighter, and Skywalker.
            Camie was involved with Laze Loneozner, whom she eventually married when Luke Skywalker and Biggs Darklighter left Tatooine. Laze Loneozner built an illegal podracer to sell in order to raise enough funds for a lavish wedding party for her.[1]
            After the deaths of Owen and Beru Lars, some of the locals believed that their nephew had murdered them. Camie Loneozner, having spent much time with him, didn't believe those rumors at all. After the Battle of Yavin, she told this to historian Voren Na'al in an interview.[2]
            When TaggeCo decided to test their Omega Frost technology on Tatooine, they bought up a number of the local moisture farms. The Loneozners took over the operations of the old Darklighter farm and were hired by the Tagges to take care of all of the local properties.[3]
            The two Loneozners ran into Luke Skywalker when he returned to Tatooine on a mission for the Rebellion. They feared that Skywalker might cause trouble and ruin their relationship with the Tagges, and so they reported him to the Imperials. However, Fixer Loneozner had second thoughts about turning in his old friend and decided to warn Skywalker about the Imperials, allowing the young Rebel to escape capture.[3]
            Camie was portrayed by Koo Stark in A New Hope, though her scenes were not used in the final film release. Her deleted scenes appeared in the first issue of the Marvel Star Wars comics adaptation of A New Hope, and she also appeared in Star Wars 17: Crucible and Star Wars 31: Return to Tatooine. The lost scenes from A New Hope can be seen in Star Wars: Behind the Magic.
            She was portrayed by Stephanie Steele for the Star Wars Radio Drama on National Public Radio.
            Her name has sometimes been misspelled as "Cammie".
            An action figure released by Hasbro in 2010 gave Camie the last name "Marstrap", a name that was once given to another of Luke Skywalker's friends, Windy. Windy was later given the last name "Starkiller", which was considered canonical in the continuity of Star Wars Legends.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Camie_Loneozner</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemCamieLoneozner</string></dict>

Before joining the Resistance, Lintra lived on a farm with her father on Pippip 3 where she learned how to fly using her father's old RZ-1 A-wing interceptor. Some time after joining the Resistance, Lintra participated in a series of missions against a group of pirates in the Cassander sector. By the time of the  war against the First Order, Lintra was known as one of the most capable pilots on the Resistance. She piloted a RZ-2 A-wing interceptor and served as Blue Leader during the evacuation of D'Qar until her demise aboard the Raddus at the hands of a pair of missiles fired by Kylo Ren's TIE Silencer.
            Tallissan Lintra was born[5] in 12 ABY[2] long after the dark days of the Galactic Empire. During her early life she and her father lived on a farm on Pippip 3, where she learned how to fly using her father's crop duster RZ-1 A-wing.[5]
            In 28 ABY,[8] Princess Leia Organa created the Resistance,[9] a small military force created to oppose the First Order.[10] By 34 ABY,[3] Lintra had joined the Resistance, becoming a lieutenant and one of their most capable pilots, impressing even Poe Dameron with her piloting skills.[5]
            In 34 ABY,[11] the Resistance learned that pirates armed by the First Order had started to raid the star systems in the Cassander sector. In response to the threat of the sector being taken by the First Order, the Resistance sent Lintra and her A-wing squadron as well as bombers from Cobalt and Crimson Squadron to the sector. The Resistance's first target in the sector was to destroy a pirate controlled spaceport on Mamkoda, Lintra and her squadron were assigned to protect the bombers while they made their attack run on the spaceport. During the battle, Lintra and her squadron encountered heavy resistance from the pirates, but the Resistance bombers were able to destroy their target.[7]
            Three days after the mission on Mamkoda, Lintra and the Resistance forces undertook a relief mission to Caraxl. While the bombers started to deliver the supplies, Lintra reported to the bombers that First Order TIE fighters were on an intercept course to their position. As their orders were to avoid confrontation with First Order vessels, the mission was aborted and they headed back to the[7] Free Virgillia-class Bunkerbuster[12] Ninka. After returning they learned that the pirates' base was located on Sheh Soahi, with the information Resistance forces were able to destroy the base and get proof of the First Order alliance with the pirates.[7]
            Following the destruction of Starkiller Base,[13] ships from the Resistance fleet arrived at D'Qar with new complements of starfighters and joined the remaining forces stationed on the planet to reinforce the Resistance base.[5]  After the Resistance learned that the First Order was regrouping, Lintra was present on a briefing where General Organa ordered to evacuate the planet, shocked by the decission Lintra discussed with Suralinda Javos about it. During the briefing Dameron designed a semi-improvised plan to protect the evacuation ships, Lintra and the A-wings were assigned as the primary defense for the fleet.[14] Dameron also designed a plan destroy a[4] Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought[12] after receiving the schematics from Inferno Squad.[15] As part of the plan squadron commander Lintra,[16] piloting an A-wing starfighter[12] and assuming the leadership of Blue Squadron,[6] was tasked to command the Resistance starfighter forces and escort the bombers to the dreadnought .[1]
            After the First Order fleet arrived at D'Qar, Lintra and the fighters started their approach to the dreadnought after Commander Dameron had destroyed all the turbolasers[6] on the Fulminatrix's[5] surface. While they started to get closer to the dreadnought Lintra ordered the bombers to stay in formation and joked with her wingmate Stomeroni Starck to not get drawn into dogfights. During their approach Teene spotted several TIE fighters closing in formation, Lintra compared their formation to dire hounds loose among whellays back home on Pippip 3.[16] Once the TIE Fighters got close enough the Resistance fighters engaged in combat trying to clear a path for the bombers, after reaching the dreadnought Lintra ordered the bombardiers to start their dropping sequence on the ship, however the majority of the bombers were destroyed after one spiraling TIE cockpit detonated the proton bombs in one of the bombers. The only bomber left managed to drop its explosives destroying the dreadnought. As the dreadnought exploded Lintra and the surviving fighters returned to[6] the Raddus[5] and jumped into hyperspace.[6]
            After fleeing from D'Qar, the Resistance fleet dropped out of hyperspace in the remote Oetchi system.[4] Unknown to the Resistance, the First Order had tracked them through hyperspace and began an attack on their fleet.[6] Lintra, whilst sleeping, had a dream where she had to protect the bombers, but she couldn't see them but instead could only locate them by the screams of their pilots as they died. After being woken up by a klaxon in the Raddus ready room, Lintra and Starck confusingly looked at the holotank and realized that the First Order fleet had followed them. After putting on her boots and her flight vest Lintra made her way to the hangar.[16] In the hangar Lintra and the rest of the fighters started up their ships in order to engage the First Order. Before they could take off, Kylo Ren fired a pair of missiles into the hangar[6] from his TIE silencer,[5] killing Lintra and destroying the starfighters.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tallissan_Lintra</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTallissanLintra</string></dict>

        <key>Arden Lyn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.338.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Arden Lyn was a female Human and master of Teräs Käsi who belonged to the Followers of Palawa. This ancient Dark Jedi, along with her fellow Palawans, joined the Legions of Lettow upon the advent of the First Great Schism between Force users, and became the lover of Xendor, head of the Legions. When Xendor was killed during the conflict, Lyn ascended to leadership of the Legions, although she was confronted by Jedi Master Awdrysta Pina. Lyn defeated Pina with a powerful Kashi Mer talisman, but the Jedi Master was able to stop Lyn's heart before being destroyed, sending the martial artist into a Force trance.
            25,000 years later, during the Great Jedi Purge, Lyn was reawakened in the Unknown Regions by scouts, before being confronted by three of Emperor Palpatine's Inquisitors: Antinnis Tremayne, Ameesa Darys, and Grand Inquisitor Laddinare Torbin. After fighting off Tremayne and killing Darys, Lyn was maimed by Torbin, who spared her life so that she could serve Palpatine as an Emperor's Hand. Lyn did so for a while, spurred on by the Emperor's promise that he would resurrect Xendor from the dead. When she finally came to accept that Palpatine had been lying, she turned rogue, and aided Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin in his attempt to abduct the Emperor. The endeavor failed, and Lyn was forced to flee. She was eventually hunted down and killed by a vengeful Palpatine.
            A Follower of Palawa[3] born during the early days of the Galactic Republic,[1] the female Human Arden Lyn was a master of the Teräs Käsi martial art.[3] The Followers of Palawa were noted for being able to master a technique for falling into a deep Force trance, allowing them to sleep for decades without aging.[2] Along with the other Followers of Palawa, Lyn fell in with the Legions of Lettow,[6] a group of Force users who had embraced the dark side of the Force and opted to turn against the teachings of the Jedi Order.[2] Lyn became the lover of that faction's leader, Xendor, a Kashi Mer exile. After her investment as a Steel Hand of Palawa, she went to the world of Pelgrin to learn her fortune from the Oracle. It told her that she would have to go to Ossus, the home of the Jedi Order, where she would meet a man with a clever mind and a fair face, and learn from him. When she arrived, she was welcomed by the Jedi as a fellow student of the Force, and joined them. While studying on Ossus, she met Xendor, who wanted to learn about Teräs Käsi, and they secretly conversed, each teaching the other. At first, Xendor merely wanted to set up another academy to study other Force traditions, when the hierarchs refused, he and Lyn left the Order and founded their own academy on Lettow, with other Jedi later accompanying them. Relations between the Order and Xendor and his disciples, who became known as the Legions of Lettow, deteriorated, and war was the result.
            The Jedi and the Legions of Lettow formed armies, with Xendor being the General and leader of the Legions, and Lyn his right hand. Together, the two of them wreaked havoc and destruction during the First Great Schism as they actively waged war against the Jedi Order.[3] During the Battle of Columus, Xendor was slain by Jedi Master Awdrysta Pina. Following Xendor's death on Columus, Lyn ascended to the leadership of the Legions of Lettow.[2] However, she knew that there was no longer a chance of victory, so they fled. Subsequently, she was tracked down by Pina, who followed her to Irkalla. While Pina disarmed Lyn of her sword, she had a powerful Kashi Mer talisman which Xendor gave her. She used that talisman, to focus all her rage, her grief and her love of Xendor to shatter Pina's katana blade, and drive its pieces into his body, fatally wounding him, bringing joy to her. However, Pina was able to use the technique of morichro to stop Lyn's heart before he died.[3]
            Due to her possession of the Kashi Mer talisman, Lyn survived Pina's attack by falling into a Force trance,[3] possibly due to her study of Palawan techniques.[2] At some point, an unidentified party discovered Lyn's body, and constructed a tomb, in which it was interned. Her decomposed body was located approximately 25,000 years later at the end of the Great Jedi Purge in the Unknown Regions by scouts. They located the Kashi Mer talisman near her body, and as they brought the artifact into Lyn's proximity she was reawakened, her body rejuvenated. Lyn believed the scouts to be the ones who had killed Xendor many years prior, and so she attacked them. Soon enough, she attracted the attention of Emperor Palpatine's Jedi hunters, the Inquisitors.[3][7] Imperial Inquisitors Antinnis Tremayne, Ameesa Darys, and Grand Inquisitor Laddinare Torbin located Lyn, and she attacked them with vigor. She was able to severely injure Tremayne and kill Darys before Torbin cleaved off her right arm. Defeated, Lyn was at the Inquisitors' mercy, but although Tremayne wanted her killed, Torbin believed that the Emperor might find some use for her rare martial arts skills.[3] He was also impressed by her use of the dark side of the Force,[6] and so he spared Lyn's life.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Arden_Lyn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemArdenLyn</string></dict>

        <key>Lin Gaava</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.341.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lin Gaava[2] was a human female who lived during the era of the New Republic.[1] She worked as a mechanic on Jace Rucklin's team, on the Colossus platform on Castilon. Gaava had red hair, blue eyes and light skin[2]
            Lin Gaava was a member of Jace Rucklin's racing team during the New Republic era, which included the male Sullustan Gorrak Wiles. They had a reputation as fun-loving troublemakers and idlers aboard the Colossus platform on the ocean world of Castilon.[2] Gaava frequented the Colossus marketplace and docks.[1][3]
            Lin and her associates Rucklin and Wiles encountered the undercover Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono, who worked as a mechanic at Jarek Yeager's repair station. Taking advantage of Xiono's dissatisfaction with his demanding employer, Rucklin and his associates befriended Xiono, appealing to his love for racing and fun. Lin also claimed that they were free to take leave anytime.[2]
            Gaava and Wiles later watched on the platform as Rucklin and Xiono raced on speeder bikes over the sea. Under Rucklin's instructions, Lin and Gorrak had sabotaged Xiono's speeder bike so that Rucklin could rescue him and gain Xiono's trust. Rucklin's plan worked and he thanked Lin and Gorrak for their work.[2]
            Later, Xiono visited Jace Rucklin's hangar where he found Lin, Gorrak, and Rucklin working on Rucklin's racer. Xiono had ignored his friend Neeku Vozo's advice that Rucklin and his associates were little more than idlers and troublemakers. Lin was stripping Rucklin's racer of "unnecessary" systems to reduce the ship's weight.[2]
            Rucklin then convinced Xiono to allow him to visit Yeager's trophy room so that he could steal a canister of Corellian hyperfuel. When Rucklin returned, Lin and Gorrak praised Rucklin for executing his heist. Lin also warned Ruckling to be careful as he poured hyperfuel into his racer's tank.[2]
            After Xiono discovered the theft, he returned to the hangar. Lin and Gorrak watched as Xiono remonstrated with Rucklin, who had already injected the hyperfuel into the racer's engines. Xiono managed to rescue an unwilling Rucklin but his racer was destroyed. Lin and Gorrak supported Rucklin when he chastised Xiono for destroying his ship. Xiono countered that Rucklin had stolen Yeager's hyperfuel, something which Rucklin denied.[2]
            While the BB-series astromech droid BB-8 was searching for Xiono, Gaava was frequenting the Colossus marketplace.[4] During Kragan Gorr's Warbirds' second raid on the Colossus, Lin and Gorrik took advantage of the chaos to salvage supplies from the marketplace.[5] 
            Lin Gaava was a female human with red hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Gaava and her associates had a reputation for laziness, humor, and playing pranks among the citizens of the Colossus. Lin liked the fact that she and her colleagues could take days off and not work like droids. She and Gorrak shared their leader Rucklin's willingness to steal and exploit his friendship with Xiono to advance Rucklin's racing ambitions. This included sabotaging Xiono's speeder bike so that Gorrak could gain his trust.[2]
            As opportunists, Lin and Gorrak took advantage of a pirate raid on the Colossus to salvage supplies from the Colossus marketplace.[5]
            Lin Gaava was a mechanic who was familiar with starships and speeder bikes.[2] 
            Lin Gaava is a character created and developed for Star Wars Resistance. She is voiced by Rachael MacFarlane.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lin_Gaava</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLinGaava</string></dict>

In 13 BBY, she snatched a piece of stolen loot from one of the younger scrumrats to give to Lady Proxima, leader of the gang, herself.
            Lexi was a human girl who lived on the planet Corellia and became a member of the criminal White Worms gang at a young age. She served the gang's leader, Lady Proxima, as a scrumrat and worked out of the Den of the White Worms along with the other members of the group.[1]
            In 13 BBY, she and three other scrumrats returned to the tunnels around the den together and emptied their backpacks to compare the loot they had stolen. A younger scrumrat showed her a a shiny piece of stolen material that he believed Proxima would give him and entire portion for; however, Lexi snatched it and claimed that she would be the one to get the portion. The boy complained and tried to grab the stolen property back, but Lexi escaped with it, so he gave chase.[1] The older scrumrat Han Solo witnessed the cruel theft, but did not intervene as he believed the boy needed to learn to fend for himself.[2]
            Lexi was cruel enough to steal from another scrumrat and potentially deprive him of his dinner.[2] She had fair skin, red hair and brown eyes.[1]
            Lexi wore brown robes with a scarf and a satchel for carrying stolen goods.[1]
            Lexi was portrayed by Lily Newmark in the 2018 Anthology film, Solo: A Star Wars Story.[1] Her dialogue is slightly abbreviated in the novelization of the film written by Mur Lafferty.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lexi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLexi</string></dict>

        <key>Larma D'Acy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.344.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Larma D'Acy[1] was a human female who served as a commander in the ground forces of the Resistance, a paramilitary group founded by Leia Organa to monitor and oppose the actions of the First Order.[2] A native of Warlentta, she was recruited personally by General Leia Organa, who greatly admired her homeworld's independent streak. D'Acy's father, despite Warlentta having declined to join the New Republic, was nonetheless a noted critic of the demilitarization efforts undertook by the Senate. D'Acy herself came from a distinguished military background, with her family charged with protecting the Warlentta system, and joined the Resistance with her family's blessing.[1]
            D'Acy attended the funeral of Han Solo and was stationed on the bridge of the Resistance flagship, the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus, during the evacuation of D'Qar and the subsequent surprise attack on the fleet when the First Order somehow tracked them through lightspeed. During the attack, the bridge was destroyed by TIE fighters[2] but D'Acy survived as she had been on an errand.[3] She then reported on the situation to the surviving Resistance members on the secondary command bridge, the only good news being that Leia was alive but unconscious. With a heavy heart, D'Acy revealed that the majority of the Resistance Command, including Admiral Gial Ackbar, had perished in the attack. Following the chain of command, leadership of the Resistance fell to Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, commanding officer of the cruiser Ninka. D'Acy followed her loyally, but this resulted in her being held at gunpoint with Holdo and several other officers when Captain Poe Dameron, at odds with Holdo over her strategies and lack of transparency, staged a mutiny. Holdo managed to regain control of the ship with the help of the newly recovered Leia, who personally stunned Poe and had him loaded onto a U-55 orbital loadlifter which she and D'Acy used to evacuate while Holdo stayed behind to pilot the Raddus, with D'Acy expressing hope that the plan worked. When Poe regained consciousness, D'Acy explained that they were heading for an old rebel base on the mineral planet of Crait where they could take refuge and send out a signal to their Outer Rim allies. When the transports came under fire, it was only thanks to Holdo's valiant sacrifice by ramming the First Order fleet at lightspeed that allowed the remainder to reach planetfall safely. Once there, D'Acy reactivated the base's shields with an ancient computer monitor and observed the battle against the First Order. The signal that Lieutenant Kaydel Co Connix sent out asking for help was received at multiple points but went unanswered, with D'Acy realising that their allies had heard them, but no one was coming. D'Acy then bore witness to the appearance of what appeared to be Luke Skywalker, who proceeded to face down the First Order while the Resistance fled through an underground tunnel, ultimately escaping aboard the Millennium Falcon. D'Acy was left as one of the few surviving Resistance members, telling C-3PO that when they got to the Outer Rim, she had a contact there who could help them.[2]
            A human female with fair skin, blonde hair and a prominent nose, Larma D'Acy was a calm and collected individual who rarely lost her composure and maintained a cool head even when under great stress. Loyal to the Resistance, D'Acy followed Vice Admiral Holdo without question and futilely attempted to intercede when Holdo and Poe Dameron butted heads over strategy. Though deeply affected by the loss of Admiral Ackbar and Leia's near-death, D'Acy nonetheless plowed on resolutely.[2]
            Larma D'Acy wore the standard Resistance officer uniform with a rank plaque denoting her rank of Commander, boots and a belt in which she holstered a standard issue Glie-44 blaster pistol.[1]
            Larma D'Acy was portrayed by Amanda Lawrence in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.

A former apprentice of the Dark Council member Darth Marr, Darth Lachris was appointed Governor of Balmorra after executing her predecessor, the inept Lysennius Melchiro, and tasked with quashing a rebel insurgency led by Grand Marshal Cheketta.
            When a Jedi Consular, the Barsen'thor, came to liberate Balmorra, Lachris was robbed of her apprentice, Lerek Serrus, and was eventually killed by the Jedi and a Balmorran resistance member, Zenith.
            During the outbreak of the Great Galactic War, a war which was fought between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, Lachris was a talented fighter in the dark side and became an apprentice of Darth Marr, member of the Dark Council. She finally received the title of Darth and rose to become a powerful Sith Lady.
            In 3653 BBY, Lachris was part of the invasion force of the Sith Empire that attacked Coruscant, the capital planet of the Republic. Following the Treaty of Coruscant, Darth Lachris took Lerek Serrus as her first apprentice during the galaxy-wide conflict, known as the Cold War that raged on for ten years.
            During the war, Darth Lachris and her apprentice led their Imperial forces on Balmorra under the rule of the Dark Council. After she executed her predecessor, she appointed herself as the local commander in chief. This was where many Balmorrans formed a resistance to strike against Lachris and her Imperial forces.
            As the Sith Empire had reached the world in progress in 3643 BBY, Lachris decided to personally visit and travel to the Sundari flat land, where there was the advanced command base of the Sith Empire. She was informed that Grand Marshal Cheketta had sent a number of Jedi reinforcements to support the resistance. She tasked an Imperial strike team to shut down the barricades from the Balmorran Arms Factory and find solid evidence of official involvement by the Republic. As the Imperials managed to infiltrate the Imperial factory and defeat the Jedi Ralon Nys along with his Tempest-squad commandos, Lachris sent the Imperials to meet the Grand Marshal. As the last remnants of the resistance formed an army, Lachris tasked the Imperial strike team to break the remaining resistance. The mission was successful and Darth Lachris took control of the world.
            The following year, Lachris managed to capture the Balmorran President Retheus Galthe to intimidate the Balmorran Resistance. However, this was when Tai Cordan and Agent Zenith were able to penetrate a weapons factory, where it was assumed that Lachris held the president.

Her family grew hydroponics gardens, buying the water from Owen Lars. Marstrap frequented the Tosche Station along with her boyfriend, Laze "Fixer" Loneozner and their friends Deak, Windy, and Luke Skywalker.
            Camie Marstrap hailed from Tatooine,[1] a sun-scorched desert planet located in the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy. Her parents, a couple of hydroponic gardeners, frequently bought water from the moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars, who lived in the Jundland Wastes.[2] As a result, Marstrap became acquainted with Luke Skywalker, the Larses' nephew and adopted son.[1] In her late teens, Marstrap lived in Anchorhead[3] and spent her free time at Tosche Station with Skywalker, Biggs Darklighter,[1] Deak, Windy,[3] and her boyfriend Laze "Fixer" Loneozner.[1] Like the other members of that small circle, Marstrap nicknamed Skywalker "Wormie," which sometimes made him doubt the sincerity of their friendship.[3]
            In 34 ABY, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker experienced a dream whilst living in exile on Ahch-To. In his dream, he married Marstrap during the early stages of the Galactic Civil War, and remained in the moisture farming business with his uncle and aunt. While dreaming of a different life, Skywalker stood outside of his homestead, gazing at the sunset with his wife as they reminisced of the time they shared together during the war between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance. Marstrap became unsettled by her husband, suspecting that he wanted to be far away from her, but Skywalker assured her that it was not the case.[4]
            A human female, Camie Marstrap had fair skin and blue eyes. She had long, wavy brown hair, which she wore down.[1]
            In the original production of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope (then known as simply Star Wars) in 1976, there were several minutes of film involving Luke Skywalker spending time at Tosche power station with his friends. The only girl in the group was Camie, portrayed by the American actress Koo Stark. Although those scenes were not used in the final film release, they still appeared in the first issue of the Marvel Star Wars comics adaptation of A New Hope.[5] They were also retained in the 1981 Star Wars Radio Drama broadcast by National Public Radio. In this dramatization, Camie was voiced by Stephanie Steele.[6] Camie made a few more appearances in various stories and sourcebooks. These sources are part of Star Wars Legends, previously known as the Expanded Universe, and are therefore not official canon.[7] However, Camie and her backstory were partially canonized by Topps's app Star Wars: Card Trader, which was released in 2015.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Camie_Marstrap</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemCamieMarstrap</string></dict>
        <key>Karé Kun</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.351.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Karé Kun was a human female starfighter pilot who served as a lieutenant in the New Republic Starfleet and as a member of Rapier Squadron. Along with fellow squadron members Commander Poe Dameron and Lieutenant Iolo Arana, she later joined the Resistance during its conflict with the First Order. She received a promotion to the rank of captain and was given command of her own starfighter squadron, Stiletto Squadron.
            Karé Kun was born on Sarq 22[1] sometime around the defeat of the Galactic Empire, and so she was known as a "victory kid." At some point, she joined the New Republic Navy and became a lieutenant, as well as Rapier Two in Commander Poe Dameron's starfighter squadron, Rapier Squadron.[2]
            About thirty years after the Battle of Endor, Kun, along with the rest of Rapier Squadron, responded to a distress call from the freighter Yissira Zyde near Suraz 4. The squadron emerged from hyperspace to find the freighter as it was boarded by First Order troops. They engaged the TIE fighters and shuttles nearby, managing to destroy all eight of the TIEs and one shuttle before the remaining shuttle and the Yissira Zyde jumped into hyperspace. Lieutenant Muran, Rapier Four, was killed when his vessel was caught too close to the Yissira Zyde as it went into hyperspace and the X-wing exploded.[2]
            During Rapier Squadron's next patrol, Dameron embarked on a solo mission to search for the Yissira Zyde, forbidding the others to assist him. He followed the telemetry of the missing freighter and jumped into hyperspace, leaving Kun and Lieutenant Iolo Arana, Rapier Three, to patrol the sector as usual.[2]
            Following Dameron's skirmish in OR-Kappa-2722, Kun, along with Dameron and Arana, joined General Leia Organa's Resistance. She and Arana were promoted to the rank of captain and given command of their own starfighter squadrons, with Kun leading Stiletto Squadron. Kun, Dameron, and Arana were transferred to the refitted MC80 Star Cruiser Echo of Hope.[2]
            Kun, along with Arana, was selected by Dameron to take part in a covert mission to steal New Republic Senator Erudo Ro-Kiintor's yacht, the Hevurion Grace, in Operation: Sabre Strike. Kun wore a bulky EVA suit and flew a Z-95 Headhunter for this mission in the Uvoss system. When the Hevurion Grace arrived in the system, Dameron disabled the ship with modified concussion missiles. He boarded the ship and forced the passengers and crew to evacuate into escape pods. While he was restarting the ships engines, a First Order fleet emerged out of hyperspace and attacked the pilots.[2]
            Ignoring Dameron's orders to escape, Kun and Arana stayed nearby to fight off the TIE fighters swarming the yacht. They destroyed nine of the eighteen TIEs before the Resistance pilots were trapped between a gas giant and the First Order fleet. To avoid the planet's gravity, the pilots risked passing over the First Order ships and made a jump to hyperspace, completing their mission successfully.[2]
            Following Operation: Sabre Strike, Dameron enlisted Kun and several other members of Black Squadron including Temmin Wexley ("Snap"), L'ulo L'ampar, and Jessika Pava on a secret quest to search for the explorer Lor San Tekka, whom Organa believed held the key to finding her brother Luke Skywalker. When L'ampar commented on the secrecy of the mission, Kun countered that he should be lucky that the Resistance allowed "old-timers" like him and Wexley near a starfighter.[3]
            Black Squadron traveled to the planet Ovanis, which was covered in mountains and ravines. While Dameron and BB-8 explored the Cave of the Crèche, Kun and her fellow pilots circled above in their T-70 X-wing starfighters and L'ampar's A-wing starfighter. After establishing contact with the Crèche cultists, Dameron informed L'ampar that he had found a tracker on his starfighter and warned that the First Order was on its way. Kun then warned him that the First Order had already arrived. She spotted a First Order platform carrying several TIE fighters, two Atmospheric Assault Landers, and a contingent of stormtroopers who were equipped with jetpacks.[3]
            Kun and her fellow pilots then discussed the meaning of Dameron's order "get me some leverage." She agreed with L'ampar's assessment that they should figure out the order themselves. After studying the situation, Wexley proposed that they take control of the First Order platform since there was nowhere else to land on the mountainous planet. When Pava proposed drawing away the starfighters, Kun warned that the new TIE/sf space superiority fighters were faster and more maneuverable than X-wings. L'ampar then agreed to attack the TIE fighters, leading to a dogfight. Black Squadron managed to shoot down several TIE fighters but L'ampar accidentally downed the First Order platform, causing it to crash.[4]
            However, the First Order Agent Terex had kept the Maxima-A class heavy cruiser Ravenous in reserve. The Ravenous launched more TIE fighters, which overwhelmed Black Squadron.[4] At the advice of Wexley, Kun and her fellow pilots flew their starfighters into the canyons in an effort to disperse their pursuers. Though Pava managed to destroy several pursuing TIE fighters, her astromech droid was hit. Under fire, Wexley realized that their plan was not working and ordered them to regroup for a head-on assault. Prior to the assault, Wexley confided that he had feelings for Kun. She responded that he would propose to her back at the Resistance base on D'Qar.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kar%C3%A9_Kun</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKareKun</string></dict>
        <key>An'ya Kuro</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.352.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>An'ya Kuro was a Human female who gave up her name in service of the Force and became the Dark Woman. A mysterious yet respected Master of the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars, the Dark Woman trained several Force-sensitives of later prominence in the Jedi arts. However, it was her failure to successfully train a female student named Aurra Sing—who later earned a reputation as a notorious slayer of Jedi—that caused the Dark Woman to enter into a self-imposed exile on the planet Cophrigin V.
            The Dark Woman later returned to the Jedi Order in accordance with the will of the Force to participate in the Clone Wars as a spy. During the onset of the Great Jedi Purge, Kuro went into hiding until she was discovered and struck down by Darth Vader.
            A Force-sensitive Human, An'ya Kuro was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, attaining the rank of Jedi Knight and constructing a purple-bladed lightsaber. Showing much devotion to the Force and the Jedi Code, Kuro took to heart the Order's rule on attachments, shedding her own name and taking up the moniker, the Dark Woman. During her time as a Knight, Kuro began to travel the galaxy to find Force-sensitive children that the Republic's screening process might have missed. In concert with the Order's Acquisition Division, one of Kuro's early successes was the discovery of a young Ki-Adi-Mundi on Cerea.[2]
            While Kuro was negotiating with the child's father in the family farm, a gang of raiders came to steal the harvest of the household. Ki-Adi-Mundi was immediately hidden because of the special status of boys on Cerea—the birth rate for female Cereans to males was twenty-to-one, and raiders would steal young boys to raise as their own. At first, the Dark Woman wished to fight the gang, but the boy's father asked her not to intervene. Indeed, even if the raiders were defeated on the spot, they would probably come back for revenge after the departure of the Jedi. Knowing all of that, Kuro put her lightsaber back and witnessed the raid. Following this new violent experience, Ki-Adi-Mundi's father accepted to let his son go. The Dark Woman was urged to take the child with her before the patriarch could change his mind.[2] Returning to Coruscant with the Cerean child, Kuro convinced the Jedi High Council to allow Ki-Adi-Mundi to begin training despite being older than most accepted Jedi Initiates. When he was old enough, the High Council chose to assign Ki-Adi-Mundi to Master Yoda for his Jedi training, lest an emotional relationship develop between Kuro and the young Cerean.[6]
            Kuro utilized unconventionally harsh training methods which were nonetheless effective, and the High Council often assigned difficult trainees to her. These methods often produced strong Jedi that inherited a hint of Kuro's darkness, as visible in her former Padawan Jon Antilles.[4] However, the harsh training conditions she imposed on her students sometimes led to failure.[6] Circa 51 BBY,[source?] Kuro discovered a Force-sensitive baby in the slums of Nar Shaddaa. Kuro brought the child to Coruscant to receive training. There, the child took the name Aurra Sing. Sing showed aggressive tendencies that led the Council to assign her to Kuro as a "problem case." Their efforts were in vain, however, and by age nine, Sing had still not attained the level of Padawan.[5] While at Kuro's training ground on Ord Namurt[8] in 44 BBY,[source?] Sing was kidnapped by space pirates who convinced the young Jedi that she was sold off by her master. Sing, who had never been close to Kuro, believed the lie. Thus began a lifelong grudge against the Jedi.[5]
            Demoralized by the loss of Sing, Kuro retreated to Cophrigin V to meditate on her role as a Jedi, her training techniques, and the future.[3] In 32 BBY, after twelve years of solitude, Kuro returned to Coruscant just as Ki-Adi-Mundi, now a famed Jedi Knight, was preparing for a mission to Tatooine. Before his departure, Kuro warned her former Padawan to take considerable care on Tatooine, as she had foreseen a great darkness approaching in her dreams.[6]
            Kuro later sparred with Ki-Adi-Mundi's new Padawan A'Sharad Hett in a training room at the Jedi Temple. Hett would not continue his training until he received a lesson from Kuro. The Dark Woman attacked Hett fiercely with her lightsaber and her own words, trying to enrage him. Hett stayed in control, phrasing passages from the Jedi Code and passed his test according to Kuro.[9]
            Two years thereafter, the assassination of two Jedi verified the rumors of Sing's return as a Jedi-hunting assassin and bounty hunter. Kuro requested that the Jedi Council place her in charge of the hunt for her former Padawan, but she was denied on the grounds of her connection to Sing. Instead, Ki-Adi-Mundi, A'Sharad Hett, and Adi Gallia were dispatched to track Sing and bring her to justice.[7]
            Kuro returned to Cophrigin V, unaware that Sing had been hired to assassinate her. The Jedi task force converged on Kuro's retreat just as Sing prepared to strike. Hett engaged Sing in battle and subdued the bounty hunter, but was forced to tap into his anger to ensure victory. Discouraged by the darkness he had seen in himself, Hett wished to give up on his Jedi training until Kuro offered to train him to control his anger. As the Jedi prepared to depart with Sing in tow, a meteor shower struck their landing site, forcing a hasty departure leaving the assassin behind.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/An%27ya_Kuro</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAn'yaKuro</string></dict>

When Order 66 was initiated by Darth Sidious at the end of the Clone Wars, Khandra went into hiding in a Jedi shrine on Anoat accompanied by three others, Mususiel, Zubain Ankonori, and Nuhj. Eventually, their haven was discovered by the Galactic Empire, who dispatched an Inquisitor to deal with them. Mususiel remained on Anoat to buy her companions time while they escaped.[1]
            On Mataou, Ankonori led their new adversary away while Khandra fled with Nuhj to Burnin Konn. With both Mususiel and Ankonori slain by the Inquisitor, Khandra lost her sense of identity as a Jedi, being forced to live in hiding and scrounge for food. At some point, the Inquisitor returned and killed both Khandra and Nuhj in a fight at a chromium mine near Wickridge. Their belongings, including a damaged lightsaber, were sealed in an Imperial vault on Nar Hypa.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Khandra</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKhandra</string></dict>

            A Force-sensitive Human, Qiina was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, serving as a Jedi Master during the decade following the Ruusan Reformations that swept through the Galactic Senate and the Order. Ten years following the end of the New Sith Wars, Master Qiina resided within the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and enjoyed long days of study in the Temple Archives maintained by Chief Librarian Barra-Rona-Ban.[1] Having studied as a Consular, Master Qiina was a learned Lore Keeper and specialized as a librarian.[2]
            During one day in the Archives, Master Qiina unknowingly sat a few meters from one of the two existing Dark Lords of the Sith, Darth Zannah. The Sith, posing as Jedi Knight Nalia Adollu, sat at a nearby terminal studying the ways in which to remove the deadly orbalisks which plagued her master, Darth Bane. Qiina became openly annoyed when Zannah and her cousin Darovit, who were both trying to look up the hyperspace route to the planet Tython, started making too much noise in their haste to leave before Darovit could be questioned about his knowledge of Zannah and her master.[1]
            Not minutes after the cousins left, Master Qiina, at the request of Master Valenthyne Farfalla, pointed out which terminal the cousins were using. After finding out where they were going, Farfalla organized a group of Jedi to follow them to Tython. There, he and the group were killed by the Sith Lords Bane and Zannah.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Qiina</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemQiina</string></dict>

        <key>Xev Xrexus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.356.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Xev Xrexus was a human female who was the boss of the Xrexus Cartel during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, she captured Eldra Kaitis, a Jedi Padawan whom Xrexus planned to sell at auction. She was later killed by Darth Maul aboard her station in order to protect his identity.
            After a shuttle that was holding many Jedi negotiators crashed due to an issue implanted secretly by Sheev Palpatine crashed leaving only Jedi Eldra Kaitis as a survivor, Xev Xrexus, crime lord and leader of the Xrexus Cartel stole the Twi'lek Padawan for herself.
            Shortly after the Xrexus discovered Kraitis, she held a party in her ship above the Drazkel system, to auction the padawan off to different Crime Syndicates and organizations. Several of the Syndicates attending were Grakkus the Hutt, the Jedi obsessed Hutt, Black Sun, the Pyke Syndicate, led by Lom Pyke, some Kyuzo hunters, Trandoshan hunters, the Ohnaka Gang, and Moogans, led by Jee Kra, some of which she describes as familiar faces others new, part of the new were certainly Darth Maul, the Dathomirian Zabrak, a member of the Sith and Nightbrothers accompanied by Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane and his crew, Aurra Sing, Vorhdeilo and the Chadra-Fan, Troo-tril-tek.
            During Xrexus' auction, she noticed that a young Darth Maul had snuck in to the  jail were Kaitis was being kept, unknown to her at the time, his intentions were, as a Sith, to murder Kaitis, as he had seen the past, and saw the Jedi order wipe out all Sith, giving him eternal and unstoppable rage, and desire for revenge. After Maul considering, and then re-considering killing Kaitis, Xrexus and her guard confront Maul, with the intention of killing him, although Maul gave her a short explanation, that he was rash, allowing Xrexus to give him a chance.
            Leader of the Moogans, Jee Kra, wins the auction, taking over Trandoshans, and Xev gives Jee Eldra,and he takes her off on his ship. but then Bane, Sing, and Vorhdeilo, attack the Moogan and his fellows, taking Eldra and storing her on their ship.
            When Xrexus finds out that Maul and his crew had stolen Eldra Kaitis, and taken her off in one of her ships, she deactivates it mid flight, and it descends to Drazkel. She comes out to the crowd and puts a bounty on Maul and Kaitis' heads, saying to the syndicates, "You were probably going to kill her any way so why not make a game out of it." On the moon of Drazkel, all survive but Troo-tril-tek, who was severely damaged and couldn't be saved by his droid as her photoreceptors had been pulled out. Aurra and Bane defeat most other syndicates, leaving only the Trandoshans. Aurra, Cad, and Vorhdeilo bail, leaving only Maul and Kaitis, who had to hunt the Trandoshans.
            Xev Xrexus was at her hideout above Drazkel, having learned from info from her scanners, All the hunters were dead, as was Eldra Kaitis. She asks her guards for something, when Maul explains that he killed them all, confusing Xrexus, thinking that he was a Jedi, who wanted vengeance for the death of Kaitis, assuming she was killed by bounty hunters, when Maul tells her she's wrong, she re-thinks, her new theory is that he is a Sith. This 'gave a reason to strike' for Maul, and he stabs her with his lightsaber.
            Darth Maul had been around Jedi, and they felt disturbances in the Force, which his master, Palpatine disliked, as it would ruin his plan. Maul's vision of the Sith being killed gave him ultimate desire for revenge, but was impatient. Maul tried to keep the assassination of Kaitis a secret from Palpatine, although he knew. Xrexus was an opportunity for Maul, a Sith more key than he seems, to do something he wasn't supposed to do, but something perfectly in Sith ritual, due to Palpatine's plan. However, when Palpatine learned of this, he was really very pleased. Xex Xrexus is an important part of Darth Maul becoming a Sith.
            Xev Xrexus first appeared in Darth Maul, Part II, a 2017 canon comic written by Cullen Bunn and illustrated by Luke Ross.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Xev_Xrexus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemXevXrexus</string></dict>
        <key>Q'anah  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.357.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Q'anah was the assumed name used by a female human who led the Senex-Juvex pirate group known as Q'anah's Marauders. The daughter of a former bodyguard, she fell in love with a young noble from House Elegin of the planet Asmeru and joined the pirate crew he secretly led. Following his death, however, she took charge of the crew and sought revenge on the ships and settlements of the Senex-Juvex worlds, earning a name for herself and becoming a folk hero.
            Following a violent encounter with the Judicial Department, Q'anah and her men were forced to relocate to the Greater Seswenna region of the galaxy where they began to prey upon the lommite shipments from the planet Eriadu. The Marauders were hugely successful in their lommite raids for sometime, using a pattern devised by Q'anah which essentially spelt out her name across each shipment. The pattern was eventually worked out by a young Outland Regions Security Force lieutenant named Wilhuff Tarkin, who used the information to predict the Marauders raids. Using a virus rigged into the cargo containers Q'anah tried to steal, the security forces were able to capture her and execute her by leaving her on a ship programmed to fly into a nearby sun.
            This female human was born on the Core World planet Brentaal IV as the only daughter of a former bodyguard for House Cormond. After her birth, her father received a lucrative offer to leave the Core and oversee security for House Elegin on the planet Asmeru, which he accepted. The daughter moved with him to the world, where she adopted a new name, Q'anah, which in an ancient language native to Asmeru referred to a festival celebrated on the 234th day of the planet's 16th month. While on Asmeru, she fell in love with the youngest son of the House her father served and became his mistress. The young noble lived a double life leading a group of pirates which Q'anah eventually joined up with and fought alongside. While serving with her lover's crew she gave birth to his triplets, but the father of her children was eventually captured and sentenced to death, being executed on the planet Karfeddion.[1]
            Following the death of her lover, Q'anah took lead of his crew, who became known as Q'anah's Marauders, and began targeting starships and settlements across the Senex-Juvex sectors and, due to her audacious raids, became a folk hero in the Senex. During this time she became the subject of many HoloNet News stories and rumors, surviving starship collisions, starfighter crashes, blaster-bolt and vibroblade wounds, fistfights, and personal duels. On one occasion she became stranded on an isolated moon while awaiting rescue and was forced to chew off her own infected hand. Twice she was captured, but instead of being sentenced to death she was given lengthy sentences in maximum security prisons due to her connections to House Elegin, although both times her pirates rescued her from incarceration. After destroying six vessels in a battle against the Judicial Forces, the Republic placed a bounty on her head which forced her to move to the Greater Seswenna region, where the Judicials rarely patrolled.[1]
            In the Greater Seswenna, the pirate and her crew allied with several other pirate groups who agreed to an alliance in order to prey upon the planet Eriadu's lommite shipments to the Core. One set of pirates would monitor or engage the limited number of vessels of the local Outland Regions Security Force and keep the others informed of their location, meaning Q'anah could safely lead the rest of the Marauders in raids on the poorly protected lommite convoys. The fastest of the Marauder's ships would attack the shepherd vessel accompanying the convoy and any security ships, while others would deliver troops to board five specific slave-rigged cargo containers carrying the lommite. The containers targeted were decided by a simple pattern Q'anah employed using the digits 23416, from the date of the Q'anah festival, with each number linked to a letter from her adopted name. The ships corresponding to these numbers would then be chosen, although the way the pattern was applied varied, sometimes starting at the front vessel, sometimes at the back, sometimes in reverse and sometimes carried over multiple convoys. These containers would then be unslaved from the convoy's shepherd vessel and instead slaved to a pirate vessel, which would lead them away to be pillaged.[1]
            Q'anah and her men would then sell the lommite or turn it over to whatever group had hired them for that specific raid. Eriadu Mining, the company who owned the lommite, eventually accepted that handing over the containers to the Marauders was cheaper than trying to defend them, which almost invariably lead to the loss of expensive company ships. Attempts were made to include dummy or explosive containers, but Q'anah's Marauders never once targeted these traps and they were discontinued due to expense. Eventually a young lieutenant in the Outland Regions Security Force named Wilhuff Tarkin worked out the pattern Q'anah used by spending months studying all her previous raids, and managed to persuade the security forces and mining company of his success, with evidence from several further raids which followed the lieutenant's predictions. Tarkin's cousin Ranulph, a commander in the security force, then proposed that the predicted containers be rigged with a hyperdrive motivator virus which would allow the security force to control the pirate's hyperspace jumps.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Q%27anah_(pirate)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemQ'anah</string></dict>

        <key>Darth Traya</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.360.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Traya (pronounced /ˈtɹeɪə/), known in her later years as Kreia /ˈkɹeɪə/, was a female Human Jedi Master-turned-Sith Master during the Dark Wars and Dark Lord of the Sith Triumvirate, ruling over the remnants of the Sith forces after their defeat in the Jedi Civil War. Prior to the Mandalorian Wars, Kreia was a Jedi Master and Jedi historian, who was exiled by the Jedi High Council because her students followed the Jedi Knight Revan, her former Padawan, into battle against the invading Mandalorians. After Kreia withdrew from the Jedi Order, she retraced Revan's footsteps to the Sith world Malachor V, being drawn to it's Force echoes. There, she discovered the Trayus Academy and turned to the dark side, becoming a Sith Master. In the years following the Jedi Civil War, Traya searched for other Force-wounds, and discovered two men who became her Sith apprentices, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus. With them she formed and became Dark Lord of a Sith Triumvirate, intent on destroying the Jedi.
            Eventually, Traya was overthrown by Sion and Nihilus, who stripped their Master of her connection to the Force. After having been exiled by both the Jedi and Sith, she held an abhorrence of how both Orders were used by the Force to its own ends, and began to consider how she might rid the galaxy of its influence forever. Going under the guise of "Kreia" once more, Traya located a former Jedi General that served in the Mandalorian Wars, Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile. Traya saw Surik as having the potential to bring her purpose to fruition, and took it upon herself to "rescue" Surik and retrain her in her own views. Even as Traya orchestrated a Jedi purge, she continued in her attempts to mold Surik—and those she traveled with aboard the light freighter Ebon Hawk—into her own image.
            Traya aided Surik in locating the Jedi Masters Zez-Kai Ell, Vrook Lamar and Kavar; Surik convinced them to reconvene at the Dantooine Jedi Enclave's ruins. When Surik met with the Masters, Traya revealed her identity as a Sith Lord, and severed the Masters from the Force killing them in the process while in the Enclave's remains. Shortly after this, Traya traveled to the secret Jedi Academy on Telos IV and convinced Jedi Master Atris to accept her turn to the dark side.

            The majority of the early life of the Human female Kreia is shrouded in mystery. However, it is known that she was a Jedi historian,[2] and that she had worked her way to the rank of Jedi Master, training many students. Kreia's eyesight went unused as she depended on meditations, attempting to penetrate the galaxy's mysteries. For decades, she challenged her students with difficult questions, such as whether a lightsaber was still a lightsaber if it lost its power, or if a Jedi was still a Jedi if she lost her Force powers. Her fellow Jedi, who called her teachings "Kreia's conundrums", viewed them as quaint, but Kreia's students were mystified.[1]
            One of Kreia's Padawans was a highly gifted Jedi who eventually became known as "Revan". However, her teachings, were looked upon with concern by the Jedi Council.[1] After Revan left Kreia's tutelage, he sought out other Jedi Masters to round out his education,[2] apprenticing himself to Jedi Masters Zhar Lestin and Dorak.[4] Eventually Revan came back to her to seek her guidance regarding the Jedi Council's stance of inaction against the Mandalorians. Revan then made up his mind to openly defy the Council. By the end of her time with the Jedi Order, Kreia's students were believed to be failures by Jedi Master Atris and the Council, because they followed Revan into the Galactic Republic's war against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, and either fell to the dark side or abandoned their training. The Council denounced both Kreia and her teachings.[1]
            After Kreia was exiled by the Jedi for her role in training Revan,[2] she began to question her beliefs, and silently withdrew from the Order. Some believed that she had followed Revan and his Jedi to war, but she instead traced her former Padawan's footsteps, searching for an answer that she alone could provide. Kreia was eventually drawn to the Force echoes of the Sith world Malachor V, a nexus of dark side energies and part of the ancient Sith Empire. On the surface, Kreia found Darth Revan's former stronghold, the Trayus Academy, an ancient dark side praxeum that contained the deepest and most intimate secrets of the Sith. She encountered Sith assassins left by Revan, but rather than attack the Jedi Master, they presented Kreia with Sith hermetica. The Sith manuscripts that Kreia used the Force to read through intimated that the truths of the cosmos were not intended for the sane. Kreia believed that the manuscripts' authors were pureblooded descendants of the ancient Sith species.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Traya</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDarthTraya</string></dict>
        <key>Satine Kryze</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.361.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Duchess Satine Kryze was the pacifistic leader of the New Mandalorians and the ruler of Mandalore during the Clone Wars. Born into Clan Kryze, Kryze left her homeworld of Kalevala to undergo diplomacy and statecraft training on Coruscant. Yet after her father, Duke Adonai Kryze of Clan Kryze, became a casualty of the ongoing Great Clan Wars, Kryze was determined to save the Mandalorians from ruination. She returned to Mandalore under the guard of two Jedi: Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who protected the young duchess from her many enemies. Kryze ended the civil war by convincing the Mandalorian chieftains to embrace peace, but though she and Kenobi developed feelings for each other, their clandestine romance was not to last. Kenobi left Mandalore with Jinn, while Kryze shouldered the burden of rebuilding her society alone. She and her regime cultivated a new age of prosperity for the Mandalorians, with her efforts turning her into a figure of controversy. Some lauded her as the Mandalore of times of old, while others criticized her nonviolent policies as too weak to stand the test of time.
            At the dawn of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, Kryze was granted leadership over the Council of Neutral Systems. She remained loyal to the Galactic Republic while officially keeping Mandalore Space unaligned with the Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, she suffered an internal threat to her rule in the form of the Death Watch, a splinter group bent on overthrowing her peace-loving administration. After Kenobi, now a Jedi Master, came to Mandalore to investigate rumors of a Separatist plot, Kryze and her old flame discovered that the leader of the Death Watch was none other than Governor Pre Vizsla of Concordia, one of her own allies. When Kryze traveled on Coruscant to reassert her people's neutrality before the Republic Senate, she further became a target of assassination by the Death Watch. Ultimately, Kryze prevailed, and with the aid of Kenobi and Senator Padmé Amidala, she exposed a conspiracy that would have resulted in a Republic occupation of Mandalore.
            Kryze's campaign for Mandalorian self-determination was not without consequences. The Clone Wars disrupted intergalactic trade, forcing her people to turn to the black market in order to survive. With the help of Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano; her own nephew, Korkie; and three other cadets from Sundari's Royal Academy of Government, Kryze unearthed a black market conspiracy, the mastermind of which turned out to be another of her most prominent supporters, Prime Minister Almec. Kryze's rule came to an end in 20 BBY, when Pre Vizsla entered into an alliance with the Sith Lord Darth Maul to seize Mandalore. After Maul's Shadow Collective army assaulted the planet, Vizsla and his Death Watch soldiers—including Kryze's estranged sister, Bo-Katan—swept in to quash the criminal invaders, garnering enough public support to depose Kryze and her colleagues. When Kenobi came to rescue Kryze from imprisonment in her own royal palace, Maul murdered her before Kenobi's eyes as retribution for his previous bisection of Maul. Kryze used her final breaths to reaffirm her decades-old love for Kenobi before passing on.
            Satine Kryze was raised on the planet of Kalevala in the Mandalore system.[1] She had at least two siblings: one through whom Kryze eventually had a nephew, Korkie, and another, Bo-Katan, who joined Death Watch.[7] Later, she became the duchess of Mandalore and led the New Mandalorians, a pacifist faction created around 738 BBY to rebuild and preserve Mandalore through reforms and peace rather than the Mandalorian tradition of violence and warfare.[6] However, a devastating Mandalorian Civil War broke out between the True Mandalorians and the Death Watch, a breakaway sect wanting to preserve Mandalore's warrior and clan-based culture.[8] During this time, Satine's New Mandalorians only advocated peace for Mandalore's fractured society. As a response to the conflict, the Republic sent two Jedi, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, on an extended mission to Mandalore. They spent a year on Mandalore protecting the young Duchess, from the hostile insurgents threatening her world, and Kryze and Kenobi grew close to each other. Despite his feelings toward her, Kenobi continued with his training and was reassigned. Kenobi later stated that had Kryze asked him to stay with her, he would have left the Jedi Order to be with her.[9]
            Kryze was left to rebuild her world and led the New Mandalorians, centered around the New Mandalorian capital city of Sundari.[5] Kryze rebuilt her government, with a Prime Minister and several Ministers[10] rather than the group of clans united under the Mand'alor, as was the tradition on Mandalore.[8] Mandalore prospered during this time period, and its society transitioned into a modern and peaceful one,[5] replacing the warrior-based culture that had dominated the planet for millennia.[8] However, her pacifist government was opposed by a group of militarists known as Death Watch, who had been defeated during the Mandalorian Civil War.[6] Duchess Kryze and several other Mandalorian officials worked to root out the Death Watch, and eventually ascertained that all of the remaining members of the organization had been exiled to Mandalore's moon of Concordia.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Satine_Kryze/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSatineKryze</string></dict>

        <key>Bo-Katan Kryze</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.363.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bo-Katan Kryze was a female Human who lived as a Mandalorian warrior during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Amidst the pan-galactic Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Katan pledged her loyalty to the radical Mandalorian splinter group known as the Death Watch, faithfully serving the group's leader Pre Vizsla as a trusted lieutenant. Ironically, she was also the sister of Duchess Satine, whom the Death Watch sought to usurp multiple times. After Vizsla was killed by Darth Maul, who claimed the title of Mandalore, Bo-Katan led a splinter group of Death Watch loyalists.
            A female Mandalorian, Bo-Katan was the sister of Satine Kryze, the Duchess of Mandalore and the leader of the New Mandalorians.[6] Bo-Katan worked as a lieutenant for the Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla during the Clone Wars.[7] At one point, while on Carlac, she met with the Separatist-affiliated Lux Bonteri, who brought along a close acquaintance, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. After the Padawan and Bonteri turned against them, Katan helped chasing the two, while the other members of Death Watch got rid of the droids who helped the young escape.[8]
            As the Clone Wars scorched on in the galaxy, Pre Vizsla and Katan found an escape pod containing the two Sith Force-sensitive Zabrak brothers known as Darth Maul and Savage Opress who were knocked out after the Skirmish on Florrum. Vizsla and Katan later brought the brothers back to their camp on Zanbar for repairs. Once Maul had awaken, he showed aggression to the Death Watch members when Katan threatened him by pointing her blaster towards Savage if he tried anything to harm them. The brother and Vizsla later gradually introduced each other then later swapped stories on how they came to where they are. Both Death Watch and the brothers later found that they had a common enemy in Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Vizsla invited Maul for a tea in his tent, where he told Maul the plans of taking over Mandalore. When Maul said it was will of the the Force which made them meet, Katan pointed out her scepticism in allying with the Sith, saying that the Sith brothers are no better than Count Dooku, who once betrayed them. She also said that the brothers are weak, as they were "put together" by the Death Watch after Kenobi defeated them on Florrum. Maul got angry on hearing it, and started choking Katan, saying that they will defeat all the pacifist Mandalorians, Dooku and all other common enemies. After it, he released Katan, who smirked at Vizsla. The Sith brothers later aligned themselves to Death Watch to help them liberate Mandalore from Satine Kryze.[3]
            After pointing out that the Death Watch warriors were not yet ready to takeover Mandalore, Maul suggested enlisting the help of the Black Sun who were located at Mustafar to begin creating an army. Bo-Katan along with the brothers and Vizsla with a strike team scurried to the volcanic planet. After the death of the Black Sun leaders, Maul gave the opportunity to join them to Ziton Moj, who carefully chose to help them embark on their campaign to Mandalore. Shortly after returning to Zanbar, the Pyke Syndicate were willing to joined them and help overthrow the Duchess.[3]
            After the Pykes joined Darth Maul's Shadow Collective, they headed towards Nal Hutta to enlist the help of the Hutt Grand Council. After negotiations have failed, bounty hunters pursued the brothers and Vizsla outside where Bo-Katan and her Nite Owls were awaiting the return of them. While Katan and her warriors fought on The Hutt guards, Maul, Vizsla and Savage faced off Sugi and Embo. After the fight had cleared up, the bounty hunters managed to get away safely with minor injuries. The Death Watch warriors were then able to capture a member of the Hutt Council who was left behind known as Oruba. He was later killed after telling them that the rest left for Tatooine.[3]
            Shortly after learning that the Hutts have fled to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, the Brothers and Death Watch launched a small attack to give Jabba a last chance to join them. After briefly seeing what the Shadow Collective was capable of and how they performed in action, the Hutts agreed to join them. However, outside the castle Vizsla told Katan to be aware, as they are going to take over Mandalore and they would finish with Maul and Opress.[3]
            After the Shadow Collective was at its full potential, Maul and Death Watch advised a plan to turn the people of Mandalore to Pre Vizsla that instructed the crime gangsters to attack several locations around the New Mandalorian capital city of Sundari, including the shipping docks and the Mandalore Banking Center. Then, Death Watch would come in and stop the vile thugs and claim Mandalore for themselves in order to gain the trust of the people. After the plan had gone underway, Vizsla alongside Katan approached Satine while she tried to calm the people. After gaining support from the people, Death Watch began to capture the attackers. Katan was tasked on capturing the Black Sun member Ziton Moj who was attacking a civilized area. After fulfilling her assignment, she helped two children out of hiding.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bo-Katan_Kryze/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBoKatanKryze</string></dict>
        <key>Sila Kott</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.364.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sila Kott was a female Human starfighter pilot who fought and died at the Battle of Endor. Kott's A-wing was part of the Rebel Alliance's Red Squadron, in which she served as Red Three. She was shot down by two TIE Interceptors in the attempt to lead them away.[1]
            Although played by British actress Poppy Hands in Return of the Jedi, Sila Kott was later dubbed by a male actor.[2] She should not be confused with Green Leader Arvel Crynyd, a similar-looking A-wing pilot who was played by a male actor, Hilton McRae.[3][4] Nevertheless, Crynyd's line "Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!" is attributed to "Red Three" in both Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays[5] and the junior novelization of Return of the Jedi,[6] although in the film, the line is actually spoken by Crynyd after Kott's A-wing is destroyed.[1]
            In Return of the Jedi, Kott responds to a command from Wedge Antilles of "Red Three, Red Two, pull in." Later in the Battle of Endor, a Y-wing pilot is called "Red Two" by Antilles, thereby suggesting that Kott is Red Three.[1] However, a Hasbro action figure set names Red Two as Kott's callsign,[7] and the line "Got it!" is similarly attributed to Red Two in both The Annotated Screenplays[5] and the Return of the Jedi junior novelization.[6] This article defers to Return of the Jedi itself and assumes that Kott is Red Three.[1]
            In 2011, original, unedited footage of Hands playing Sila Kott was included on the Star Wars: The Complete Saga Blu-ray release, speaking dialogue in her actual voice after being prompted by an off-camera crew member.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sila_Kott/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSilaKott</string></dict>
        <key>Cordé</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.365.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cordé was a Human female handmaiden and decoy for Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo during the end of the Separatist Crisis.
            While Amidala was Queen of Naboo, the role of decoy was mainly filled by Sabé.[3] Cordé replaced her when Amidala stepped down from the throne and became the Senatorial representative of the Chommell sector. Like Sabé, Cordé worked closely with Padmé, and the two women became close friends.[4]
            In 22 BBY, Cordé was killed in an assassination attempt on Amidala when the Senator returned to Coruscant for the Senate vote on the Military Creation Act. A Clawdite bounty hunter named Zam Wesell was responsible for the attack. One of Amidala's other handmaidens, Versé, and five Naboo guards were also killed in the blast.[2]
            Cordé died apologizing to Amidala, disheartened in thinking she had failed her duty to her mistress. On the contrary, the Senator was heartbroken by Cordé's sacrifice, regrettably accepting that she had performed her duty. At Captain Typho's insistence, Amidala reluctantly left the bodies of Cordé and the other victims behind, promising herself that their sacrifice would not be in vain.[2]
            Cordé was played by three people during her brief appearance in Attack of the Clones. She was played by Natalie Portman for her small scenes inside the cruiser and walking down the ramp, by a stunt actress for the explosion, and by Veronica Segura for her death scene.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cord%C3%A9/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemCorde</string></dict>
        <key>Morrigan Corde</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.366.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Morrigan Corde was a Human female who served as an Imperial Intelligence agent before and during the Sith–Imperial War and later a Moff in the Moff High Council of the new Galactic Empire around 137 ABY under the persona of Nyna Calixte. While out in the field, she had a chance meeting with Kol Skywalker, a member of the Jedi Council. The pair fell in love, married and had a son, Cade. However, claiming that the Empire recalled her back into service, Morrigan left her new family when Cade was still a toddler. Shortly afterward, she abandoned her true identity for approximately two decades, assuming the persona of Nyna Calixte.
            As Calixte, Corde became the Director of Imperial Intelligence, and was later appointed a Moff. She entered into a marriage with fellow Moff Rulf Yage, and they had a daughter, Gunn. However, the marriage would prove to be short lived, and Calixte entered into an affair with another Moff, the more powerful Morlish Veed.
            When the One Sith approached the Empire in 128 ABY offering to help in the Empire's war against the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, they did so through Calixte. She manipulated the other Moffs into accepting the Sith's offer, then plotted with Veed to place him on the Imperial throne. However, her plan was foiled when Darth Krayt claimed the throne for himself.
            In 137 ABY, she "reactivated" her Morrigan Corde persona to help keep Cade Skywalker from being turned to the dark side of the Force by the Sith. She also began to feed information to Roan Fel to undermine the Sith efforts to enforce their absolute rule throughout the galaxy and win back Fel's trust.
            Prior to the Sith–Imperial War, Corde operated under her true identity of Morrigan Corde and was employed as an Imperial Intelligence agent. While out in the field, she met and fell in love with Kol Skywalker, a member of the Jedi Council. After being paired together on a mission, the pair secretly married, with Kol's brother Nat being one of the very few people that knew about the marriage. Kol and Corde had a son, Cade, and Corde spent around two years away from her Imperial Intelligence job to raise him. During this time, Imperial Intelligence had considered Corde as missing in action, and she eventually felt trapped in her new role as the non-Force-sensitive mother to a Skywalker child. Corde believed that she had a different path to follow than that of Kol and the Jedi, and she felt that by her continuing her military career, she was doing the right thing. In the face of objections from Kol, Corde decided that leaving her husband and young son was what was required of her. Shortly after returning to Imperial Intelligence in 117 ABY, Morrigan Corde retired from the field, and she would not operate under the identity again until 137 ABY.[1]
            As "Nyna Calixte", another identity, she rose rapidly through the ranks of Imperial Intelligence, eventually becoming the head of the department. At some point she was also appointed to the position of Moff, although some of her colleagues on the Council of Moffs insinuated that she had not earned the honor through merit alone.[3] Also around this time, she married and later divorced her fellow Moff Rulf Yage, and together they had a daughter, Gunn.[6] Nyna had very little to do with Gunn's upbringing, and Gunn despised her mother for leaving her and her father and entering into an affair with Morlish Veed, an affair that Calixte hoped would benefit her politically.[6]
            In 126 ABY, Nyna was aboard an Imperial Star Destroyer above the planet Wayland. At the same time, a damaged shuttle carrying Kol Skywalker, his son Cade, Jedi Knight Wolf Sazen and the Vong Master Shaper Nei Rin fled the planet after an attack caused by the sabotage of the Ossus Project, which had turned Wayland's inhabitants into Vongspawn[7]. Calixte's Star Destroyer rescued the vessel and the former lovers met again. Though Skywalker did not betray Nyna's former identity, she nonetheless refused to speak to her son, even though he had not recognized her.[8]
            When the One Sith first approached the Empire in an effort to aid them in their war against the Galactic Alliance, they did so through her.[3] The Sith had engineered the war in an attempt to destabilize the galaxy, after sabotaging the Ossus Project and using the lingering hatred many still felt against the Yuuzhan Vong for their invasion over one hundred years ago to shift the blame. The Empire declared war against both the Galactic Alliance and the Jedi, and when the Sith approached the Empire with their help, Calixte manipulated the other Moffs into allying with the Sith behind Emperor Roan Fel's back. Appealing to the Moffs' greed for power, she then secured their cooperation and received the approval of the Moffs to join the war on their side.[6]
            In 130 ABY, Fel discovered the extent of the Sith conspiracy, and realized that Calixte was behind it. After angrily confronting her and almost killing her with his lightsaber, he backed down only when he received a communication from Morlish Veed that the Galactic Alliance had surrendered. Shortly after accepting the surrender of the Galactic Alliance, Roan Fel stated that he wanted to send a diplomatic mission to the Jedi on Ossus, with the intent of persuading them to join the Empire. When Rulf Yage and Darth Nihl instead led an attack on the Jedi, Calixte expressed her disapproval to Darth Maladi, stating that the attack had gone off without the approval or knowledge of both the Emperor and the other Moffs.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Morrigan_Corde</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMorriganCorde</string></dict>
        <key>Shae Koda</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.367.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shae Koda was a female Human Je'daii Ranger who served the Je'daii Order on Tython at the height of the Infinite Empire's reign. Only a Je'daii Journeyer when the Rakatan ship called the Devourer crash landed on Tython in 25,793 BBY, she was one of the first Je'daii to investigate the crash and discovered the Force Hound Xesh amid the rubble. Convinced that he would be an ally amid the coming tribulation, Koda was always his champion and served alongside him during the Infinite Empire's Invasion of the Tython system. Becoming romantically involved with Xesh, the pair survived the war and journeyed into the Silent Desert together at its conclusion.
            A Force-sensitive Human of Dathomiri descent, Shae Koda was trained in the ways of the Force by the Je'daii Order on the planet Tython, one of nine planets in the Tython system which made up the Settled Worlds. Raised by her parents until she was orphaned at the Battle of Tython, the final battle of the Despot War, Koda achieved the rank of Journeyer at which time she carried a single Force-imbued blade as a defense against the wilds of Tython. During her travels between the nine Great Temples in 25,793 BBY, Koda studied under the guidance of Temple Master Quan-Jang at the Temple of Science, Anil Kesh. Together in the labs, Koda and Master Quan-Jang created a rancor-dragon through alchemy, whom Koda named Butch.[3] Sometime during their work together, Koda delved into the Abyss of Ruh to collect specimens for the project and almost died.[4]
            While attempting to train the rancor-dragon, a mysterious man named Xesh, a Force Hound of the Infinite Empire crashed the Rakatan ship called the Devourer near the Rift on Tython. The surge of deaths associated with the crash alerted all Je'daii to the foreign presence on the world, as well as stirring a Force storm that would rage across the entire planet. Sensing the disturbance through a vision while deep inside the Rift, Koda was nearly killed before being rescued by Master Quan-Jang. Detailing the vision to her master, Koda was ordered to follow the vision to where ever it may lead in order to maintain balance in the Force.[3]
            At the crash site, Koda met fellow Journeyers Sek'nos Rath and Tasha Ryo, both of whom had experience similar visions. Searching the wreckage of the alien ship, the trio discovered an escape pod carrying the stranger known as Xesh.[3] Drawing their blades, the Je'daii were shocked as Xesh's Forcesaber easily cut through their durasteel blades. Despite the loss of their weapons, the three Je'daii's mastery of the Force outmaneuvered Xesh and Koda was able to take the Forcesaber from his grasp. Unarmed and winded, the Je'daii forced Xesh deeper into the Rift towards the dangerous Abyss of Ruh.[4] While tracking the Force Hound, the three Je'daii experienced hallucinations brought on by the dark energies inside the Abyss. Koda was sent into a rage after apparitions of her deceased parents stirred resentment she held towards them for abandoning her through their deaths. After Rath was able to calm her, the trio was able to locate Xesh as he battled a saarl. When Rath's distraction only antagonized the beast, the group was forced to flee deeper into the cave. Making a final stand, Koda and her allies attempted to hold off the beast but were unable to turn on the Forcesaber she had confiscated from Xesh. At the urging of her fellows, Koda relinquished possession of the saber to Xesh in hopes that he would activate it and kill the saarl; however Xesh took the weapon and abandoned the Je'daii to their fate. To his surprise, none of them did. Xesh then spontaneously aided Koda against the saarl, ultimately killing it.[4]
            The Je'daii Masters soon arrived, having determined that Xesh was the cause of the storm threatening Tython and demanded that he surrender. Xesh then turned on the Je'daii, only to be struck by lightning channeled by Master Quan-Jang. In anger, Shae grabbed Xesh's Forcesaber, blaming him for the apparent death of her Master. Xesh willingly resigned himself to death and encouraged her to eat his heart. Shae relented, stating that it wasn't the Je'daii way. Xesh remarked that they were odd beings and passed out.[5]
            Later, Koda was training with Ryo and Rath on Stav Kesh with master Tave. Tave realized that three were too focused on Xesh to think about their lessons. They complained to him that their visions were being ignored. Tave assured them that the situation was far too dire to ignore. He then told Rath and Koda to go to The Forge and Ryo to report to Kaleth.[6]
            At The Forge Master Madog was studying Xesh's Forcesaber. He asked Koda to ignite it. Failing, she suggested that Madog's testing had broken the weapon. However, Hawk Ryo took and activated the weapon, explaining that he used Bogan to do so. Koda later explained this to Quan-Jang, claiming she had resisted the temptation to ignite the Forcesaber. Quan-Jang ordered her to give into temptation then next time, explaining "We must delve into the Dark for greater understanding". Rath appeared and attempted to cheer up Koda, by saying that he wished that he could be given a chance with the Forcesaber. Koda, however, stated that she would rather forget about certain things. But Rath continued, realizing that brought up memories of her parents' death. Rath continued trying to improve Koda's mood pointing out that her parents' sacrifice saved Tython--and they too had saved Tython from Xesh's ship.

        <key>Kaydel Ko Connix</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.368.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kaydel Ko Connix was a human female who lived during the era of the New Republic as well as the subsequent war between the First Order and the Resistance. Born on Dulathia, Connix ultimately joined the Resistance—a paramilitary organization that opposed the First Order—and was stationed at the D'Qar headquarters by 34 ABY. Serving under the command of General Leia Organa, a veteran of the Rebel Alliance and leader of the Resistance, Connix worked as an operations controller in Fleet Command, coordinating communications between T-70 X-wing starfighter pilots and their commanders.
            Connix's service as an operations controller resulted in her promotion to the rank of lieutenant following the Resistance victory at the Battle of Starkiller Base. Anticipating the First Order's retaliatory strike against the Resistance, Connix was entrusted with supervising the evacuation of the D'Qar base. It was her responsibility to prioritize supplies and ensure an orderly retreat. She narrowly escaped the planet in a shuttle just prior to the base's destruction, an act carried out by First Order Navy's Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix. She then resumed her responsibilities as a sensor ops officer aboard the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus while also retaining her new rank.
            During the flight of the Resistance fleet from the First Order, Connix was one of several Resistance officers who supported Captain Poe Dameron's mutiny against Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. Their efforts to secure the bridge ultimately failed, however. Dameron was incapacitated by Organa herself, causing Connix and the other mutineers to surrender. Despite their actions on the Raddus, Connix and Dameron remained in service to the Resistance during the Battle of Crait. They were among the few survivors who boarded the YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon in order to escape from the forces of the First Order.
            Kaydel Ko Connix was a native of Dulathia.[1] As political relations worsened between the New Republic and the First Order, the latter was opposed by Princess Leia Organa, who founded a private military group known as the Resistance to monitor the First Order's activities.[4] Connix ultimately joined the naval branch of the Resistance and was assigned to Fleet Command.[1] By 34 ABY, approximately three decades after the Battle of Endor,[5] Connix was serving as an operations controller under the direct command of Organa,[1] who—in her capacity as leader of the Resistance—assumed the rank of general.[3]
            Following the Hosnian Cataclysm and the Battle of Takodana, the Resistance attacked Starkiller Base in the hope of destroying the First Order's superweapon.[3] During the battle, Connix coordinated communications[2] between the T-70 X-wing starfighter pilots and their commanders from the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar.[3] After the destruction of Starkiller Base, Connix was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in recognition of her service as an operations controller as well as the need for an officer to oversee the D'Qar evacuation. In this capacity, she was tasked with prioritizing supplies and coordinating an organized retreat.[1] She was still managing the evacuation from the planet's surface when the First Order Navy invaded the Ileenium system. The base was destroyed from orbit by the Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix, although Connix managed to escape just in time on one of the last departing shuttles. After boarding the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus, she returned to her duties as an operations controller but was allowed to retain her new rank.[6]
            While the Resistance fleet fled from the First Order warships, including Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship Supremacy, Captain Poe Dameron enlisted Connix's assistance for an unauthorized mission—to help Finn and Rose Tico escape from the Raddus so that they could ultimately disable the First Order's hyperspace tracking system. Using her position on the starship's bridge, the lieutenant ensured that their departure went unnoticed by Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. After discovering Holdo's intention to evacuate the crew of the Raddus on several transports, Connix and several Resistance officers supported Dameron's mutiny against Holdo. With the admiral and her supporters detained at the point of a blaster, Connix and Dameron seized control of the bridge but were ultimately confronted by Organa. Using the stun setting on her blaster pistol, the general shot Dameron and accepted Connix's surrender.[6]
            Despite her role in the conspiracy against Holdo, Connix continued to serve the Resistance and was among the survivors who took control of an abandoned Rebel Alliance outpost on Crait. The ensuing battle on Crait marked the near destruction of the Resistance. However, Connix was able to evacuate the outpost along with Organa, Dameron, and several other survivors who used the YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon to escape from the armies of the First Order.[6]
            Kaydel Ko Connix was a human female[2] who had light skin, brown eyes, and blond hair which she wore up in two buns—one on either side of her head.[3] Her service as an operations controller was viewed favorably by her superiors, resulting in Connix's rise to the rank of lieutenant.[1] However, while serving under Amilyn Holdo, Connix sympathized with Poe Dameron's misgivings about the Vice Admiral's leadership style. Her support for Dameron led Connix to engage in activities ranging from conspiracy[2] to open rebellion against Holdo. After abandoning the Raddus during the First Order's assault on the Resistance fleet, Connix watched as Holdo altered the ship's course and assumed that the Vice Admiral was trying to save herself. In reality, Holdo was sacrificing herself in order to destroy Supreme Leader Snoke's Star Destroyer, the Supremacy.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kaydel_Ko_Connix</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKaydelKoConnix</string></dict>
        <key>Cova Nell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.369.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cova Nell[2] was a human female who served as a transport[1] and starfighter[3] pilot in the naval branch of the Resistance during their war against the First Order.[1] She and Pamich Nerro Goode co-piloted one of the thirty U-55 orbital loadlifter that were used to evacuate the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus[2] after the First Order attacked the Resistance fleet. Her vessel's passengers included General Leia Organa and Captain Poe Dameron; it was one of the transports that made it to the surface of the planet Crait.[1] During planetfall they were comforted by General Organa, who reflected that the pilots would soon feel survivors guilt.[3] On Crait, the Resistance made a last stand against the First Order in an old Rebel Alliance outpost, with those who survived escaping in the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon.[1] She wore a white helmet with a yellow flight suit made of flame-resistant material with a white harness and brown boots.[2] An Aurebesh inscription on her pilot helmet read "Hello nasty".[1] Nell had fair skin and brown eyes.[2]
            Cova Nell was portrayed by Daniela Tlumacova in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi,[1] which was released on December 15, 2017.[4] The character was not named in the film,[1] but received identification in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo[2] and released in conjunction with the film.[5] The Aurebesh inscription on Nell's pilot helmet, "Hello nasty",[1] is a reference to the Beastie Boys album of the same name.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cova_Nell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemCovaNell</string></dict>

        <key>Kyrsta Agate</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.371.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kyrsta Agate was a female human who served as a commander in the New Republic Starfleet. She was a part of several meetings of New Republic officials who discussed the evolving mission on the planet Akiva. She was chosen by Fleet Admiral Ackbar to lead New Republic forces during the Rebellion on Akiva. By 5 ABY, Agate had been promoted to Commodore and commanded the New Republic forces at the Battle for Kuat Drive Yards. Later, she narrowly survived an assassination attempt during the attack on Chandrila.
            Agate was disfigured and lost an eye. Despite experiencing a spell of depression, Agate returned to her duty as a New Republic Commodore. She commanded the Starhawk-class battleship Concord during the Battle of Jakku. Agate played an important role in bringing down the Imperial Super Star Destroyer Ravager. Though Agate perished during the assault on the Ravager, her actions turned the tide of the battle in the New Republic's favor.
            Kyrsta Agate was a commander in the New Republic Defense Fleet following the Battle of Endor. As a senior officer, she was privy to Admiral Gial Ackbar's secret contacts with the Imperial informant known as the Operator. Commander Agate trusted Ensign Deltura well enough to share this information with the young cadet. Later, she attended a hologram meeting with Admiral Ackbar, Captain Saff Melor, General Crix Madine, and the newly-appointed Chancellor Mon Mothma to discuss the reliability of the Operator and sending military forces to the planet Akiva.[2]
            During the meeting, Agate opined that they could trust the Operator but Admiral Ackbar counseled that the Galactic Empire could be leading them into a trap. When Captain Melor advocated sending the fleet, Chancellor Mothma cautioned against a show of force in the Outer Rim Territories. Admiral Ackbar then managed to get the group to support sending a small scouting party of New Republic Special Forces soldiers to investigate the situation on Akiva.[2]
            Later, Commander Agate along with General Madine, Chancellor Mothma, and Ensign Deltura were present when Admiral Ackbar received Captain Wedge Antilles' transmission from Akiva warning about a high-level Imperial summit on Akiva. She listened as Admiral Ackbar ordered her to lead a small fleet to aid the rebellion on Akiva. During the battle, Agate commanded her forces from the bridge of the Alderaanian frigate Sunspire.[2]
            Upon entering the Akiva system, Agate managed to control her shaking and learned that a yacht was flying to one of the orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers. When the Klatooinian Ensign Targada asked whether they should shoot down the yacht, she ordered him not to shoot it down because it could carry intelligence vital to the New Republic's war effort. Instead, she ordered him to concentrate fire on the Star Destroyer in an effort to deny the ship an escape. This Star Destroyer turned out to be Admiral Rae Sloane's flagship Vigilance.[2]
            Agate's fleet proceeded to decimate two of the orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers. When the Pantoran Ensign Uray informed her they were winning the engagement, Agate responded that winning did not mean won and ordered him to keep up the pressure. Uray then informed her that the New Republic starfighter pilot Norra Wexley had commandeered a TIE fighter and was claiming to be from Gold Squadron. Agate ordered her crew to provide Norra with support and to get her on the comm. With the defeat of Imperial forces, the New Republic gained control of Akiva which then joined the fledgling government.[2]
            By 5 ABY,[5] Kyrsta Agate had attained the rank of Commodore in the New Republic Starfleet. She was given command of the Starhawk-class battleship Concord, which was one of the New Republic capital ships constructed at the Nadiri Dockyards inside the Bormea sector. As Commodore, Agate led a task force of two ships including the Concord and her old ship Sunspire to rescue Lieutenant Norra Wexley and Captain Antilles, who had come under attack from Imperial forces on the edge of Wild Space. She oversaw the destruction of the Imperial Star Destroyer Scythe.[3]
            Once Norra and Wedge were safely aboard the Concord, Agate lectured Norra about war and killing. Getting to the point, she reminded Norra that she did not want her soldiers to become unrepentant killers but that she wanted soldiers who hated killing. When Norra suggested that this could cause them the war, Agate responded that they would lose the war by keeping themselves. Agate then informed Norra that she had spoken to Captain Antilles, who had told her about Norra's mission to find the rebel hero Han Solo. Agate then told Norra that they had no orders to find Solo since he had resigned his commission as general.[3]
            Later at the Chandrilan capital of Hanna City, Commodore Agate, Admiral Ackbar, and Captain Antilles met with Norra and her team; which included her son Temmin, his B1 battle droid Mister Bones, the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, the New Republic soldier Jom Barell, and the Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari. When Admiral Ackbar ordered Norra and her team to cease their search for Solo and to resume their hunt for Imperial war criminals, Norra resigned her commission in the New Republic military to search for Solo.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kyrsta_Agate</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKyrstaAgate</string></dict>
        <key>Bink Kitik</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.372.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bink Kitik was a female Human ghost burglar who aided the smuggler Han Solo during a complex heist on the planet Wukkar in 0 ABY. She was often aided in her exploits by her twin sister, Tavia Kitik, who possessed considerable electronics expertise. The sisters often exploited their resemblance to confuse their marks, but while Bink enjoyed her criminal lifestyle, Tavia was a reluctant, if highly-adept, participant in their heists.
            Bink Kitik was a female Human ghost burglar who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire and was the identical twin sister of the electronics expert Tavia Kitik.[1] By the time they were ten years old, Bink and Tavia were already orphans. Their father was killed in the Clone Wars and their mother died a few years later. At some point, the pair traveled aboard a luxury liner on a voyage to the planet Kailor V, and Bink began wooing the business man Cristoff in an attempt to steal his jewels, and she sat next to him at the captain's table during meals on multiple occasions. She initially hoped to receive an offer from Cristoff to visit his stateroom aboard ship, so that could break into his safe and take his gems, but while she received multiple requests from him to visit her cabin, he never offered to take her back to his own room. During her dalliances with Cristoff, Bink wore a sensor mesh that had been designed by Tavia beneath her dress, to detect on what part of his body Cristoff was carrying the keycard to his room.[2]
            On the last night of the cruise, while the liner was docked with the Kailor V transfer station, Tavia distracted Cristoff while pretending to be her sister, and Bink gained access to his stateroom using a copy of his keycard that Tavia had created with the sensor mesh data. Through chemicals released from his body due to his prior consumption of falpas sauce, Bink was able to detect which numbers on his safe keypad he had keyed in and amount of times had touched them. Using knowledge she had gained of his personal history, she worked out that correct password was the date and CTE market number of a corporate takeover that brought Cristoff wealth and power, and she opened to safe and stole some of the gems that lay within.[2]
            At some point, Bink and Tavia traveled to Danteel City, planning to rob the vault of a prominent casino owner, Veilred Jydor. They were also working with a Balosar con artist named Zerba Cher'dak. While there, Bink spotted a human gambler named Lando Calrissian, who was there for a high-stakes sabacc game that Jydor was holding as a way of selling a highly-valuable statue, a Tchine. However, when they realized that Jydor's business manager Darim Chumu had committed murder to obtain another Tchine, Bink, Tavia, and Zerba teamed up with Calrissian to implicate Chumu.[3]
            In 0 ABY, Bink and Tavia became part of a group of criminals that were gathered together by the smuggler Han Solo to steal the riches of the Black Sun official Avrak Villachor from a vault on the planet Wukkar.[1]
            Solo and his Wookiee companion Chewbacca found the sisters as they were completing a heist. As Bink returned to her sister, Solo made his offer: a share in 163 million credits if they successfully robbed Villachor. Intrigued, Bink and Tavia took the job. Villachor had stolen the credits in credit tabs from a local man named Eanjer Kunarazti after murdering Eanjer's family, and the man had hired Solo to recover them. Solo recruited a large team to pull off the heist, including the twins.[4]
            Bink's role as ghost thief was to help with intrusion into Villachor's vault. One of her first assignments was to penetrate a suite of hotel rooms at the Lulina Crown Hotel reserved by visitors of Villachor, who the team soon discovered were Black Sun Falleen. Bink used a manual cable rig to cross the trees of a courtyard successfully broke into the hotel rooms, discovering a safe. Bink cracked into the safe to find it contained a cryodex encryption device, but not the credit tabs they were looking for. Thanks to a diversion from Dozer Creed, another member of Solo's team, Bink was able to escape without detection from Villachor's associates.[4]
            The next stage in the plan was for some of Solo's people to discreetly approach Villachor in an attempt to incite a defection, however; the plan was a ruse to gain access to Villachor's vault. As part of this process, Bink was given a cover identity as a local businesswoman and assigned to attach herself to Lapis Sheqoa, Villachor's security chief, and discern the security measures guarding the vault from him, during the Festival of Four Honorings, a Wukkar festivity.[4]
            Bink had a more casual and relaxed approach to life than her sister Tavia.[5] She was a skilled thief and she was experienced at manipulating members of the opposite sex in order to aid her crimes.[2]
            Bink Kitik was created by Timothy Zahn as a character for his novel Scoundrels, which was released in January 2013. Prior to the novel's release Kitik was referenced in the guidebook The Essential Reader's Companion and she appeared in Heist, a short story published in the magazine Star Wars Insider 138 that was written by Zahn as a tie-in to the novel. She is also featured in the e-book novella Winner Lose All, another tie-in to Scoundrels that was written by Zahn.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bink_Kitik</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBinkKitik</string></dict>

        <key>Clat'Ha</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.374.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Clat'Ha was a Human female who worked as the chief operations manager for Arcona Mineral Harvest Corporation. She also had a deep rivalry with Jemba the Hutt and was a close friend to the Arcona miner Si Treemba. She was one of the first of the miners to befriend Obi-Wan Kenobi after his fight with Grelb the Hutt.
            She once saved Qui-Gon Jinn's life during a pirate attack on the transport they were traveling on, the Monument. A Togorian pirate captain was about to kill Qui-Gon, and failed to notice the presence of Clat'Ha, who shot him in the head. Along with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan Kenobi, she later helped defend a cave in which crew and passengers of the Monument were hiding from draigons, after the Monument crash-landed on a blue marble planet near Bandomeer.
            In 44 BBY, Clat'Ha and the corporation miners left Coruscant to set out to Bandomeer and oversee the extraction of minerals that were on the planet. While boarding the Monument, she saw a young boy who was severely beaten by Grelb the Hutt. The boy was revealed to be Obi-Wan Kenobi. Clat'Ha immediately saved his life and took the unconscious Initiate on board the ship. When Obi-Wan woke up, Clat'Ha was impressed by his courage and offered him a job in the corporation. She explained to him about the war between both corporations and added that one of the managers of Offworld Mining, a Hutt named Jemba, hindered this task to increase the price of his employees. Obi-Wan suggested that both companies should reach an agreement, but Clat'Ha firmly refused since she couldn't risk everything for her employees.
            When the Monument was under attack by pirates, Clat'Ha saved the life of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn when a Togorian pirate attempted to kill him, and failed to notice the presence of the young woman who shot him in the head. Qui-Gon was wounded, and Clat'Ha refused to leave him while the pirates were overwhelmed by Jemba's employees. After the pirates fled, the Monument had to make an emergency landing on an island of an unknown planet with five moons. Before landing, Clat'Ha, accompanied by Kenobi and Jinn, went to meet Jemba, who was enticing a number of employees from Clat'Ha's corporation to join his. A number of miners began to move towards the Hutt, but Clat'Ha was able to prevent that from happening.
            Sometime later, when the Monument landed on an island, Clat'Ha and the rest of the crew prepared to evacuate when the transport began to flood. She was surprised to learn that Qui-Gon reported that he had discovered the location of the dactyl which Jemba and his thugs stole from the transport. Together with the crew, Clat'Ha and Qui-Gon moved to one of the caves that were on the island until they were attacked by the draigons. She helped defend the caves and contacted Aggaba. She offered to let the Hutt join her corporation. Aggaba and his staff agreed, and the fight between the two companies came to an end. After the fight ended, the engineers were able to repair the Monument, and the companies withdrew from the planet. Clat'Ha remained on site and directed her activities of both companies until her death.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clat%27Ha</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemClat'Ha</string></dict>
        <key>Morna Kee</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.375.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Morna Kee was a loyal human female pilot and officer in the Galactic Empire, one of few remaining after the destruction of the Second Death Star. She was the pilot for Admiral Rae Sloane, and the two shared a good relationship. She was present on Akiva while the Imperial Future Council met to determine the fate of the Empire. When the meeting failed to come to a conclusion and Akiva began to revolt against the Imperial occupation, she flew the Golden Harp, a large yacht, in an attempt to flee. The ship was shot from the ground and heavily damaged, but she was able to fly through the Rebellion on Akiva safely and crash land on the Vigilance. She and Sloane then switched ships to a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle and fled to the Vanquish before making their escape into hyperspace. She was at one point in command of a VT-49 Decimator.
            Morna Kee was an Imperial Military pilot who lived during the Age of the Empire. Following the Battle of Endor, Morna accompanied her commander Admiral Rae Sloane, the aide Adea Rite, and several stormtroopers for an Imperial emergency summit on the Outer Rim planet Akiva to discuss the future of the Galactic Empire. They were also accompanied by the captured New Republic starfighter pilot Wedge Antilles, who had been taken prisoner during a recon mission above Akiva. While descending into the capital city Myrra, Sloane used the Lambda-class shuttle's weapons systems to shoot a Zabrak bounty hunter who had been spying on the Imperial ships from a nearby comm tower. This bounty hunter turned out to be Jas Emari, who later joined a rebel cell headed by the New Republic pilot Norra Wexley.[1]
            During the Imperial Future Council's summit, Sloane instructed Adea to tell Morna to have the shuttle ready to take off after dinner in order to bring more delegates to the meeting. Before Adea could proposed getting Morna to plot hyperspace calculations into the shuttle computer, they received news that a New Republic freighter had entered Akiva's atmosphere. The freighter was shot down but one New Republic Special Forces soldier Jom Barell managed to land in Akiva's atmosphere.[1]
            After Norra disrupted the Imperial summit by inspiring a rebellion on Akiva and destroyed several Imperial shuttles, Morna was wounded when a TIE fighter hijacked by Norra crashed into the Satrap's Palace. After getting her injuries treated, Morna complied with Sloane's orders to seize control over the Imperial financier Arsin Crassus' luxury yacht Golden Harp. When Crassus' pilot fought her, she overpowered him and locked him in one of the yacht's bedrooms. She and Admiral Sloane then flew the shuttle. Their passengers included Adea, Crassus, Grand Moff Valco Pandion, General Jylia Shale, Imperial Adviser Yupe Tashu, several stormtroopers and Emperor's Royal Guards. They were also accompanied by the rebel captives Norra, Jas Emari, and the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus. Norra's teenage son Temmin Wexley also managed to sneak aboard the ship and free his mother and her fellow rebels.[1]
            As they flew to Sloane's Imperial Star Destroyer Vigilance, the Golden Harp was struck by a turbolaser that had been hijacked by Jom. With much difficulty, Morna and Sloane managed to land the Golden Harp inside the Vigilance's hangar. During the crash-landing, Crassus and several Imperial passengers were killed. However, Norra and her rebel team survived and managed to capture Adea, General Shale, and Tashu. Morna and Norra then fled aboard another Imperial shuttle as the Vigilance came under attack from a New Republic fleet.[1]
            As they were flying their shuttle to the Star Destroyer Vanquish, Morna and Sloane were accosted by Grand Moff Pandion, who had managed to sneak aboard their ship. He demanded that Admiral Sloane take him to the Super Star Destroyer Ravager so that he could take control of the Empire's last Super Star Destroyer. Sloane rejected his demand and revealed that she was serving Fleet Admiral[1] Gallius Rax.[2]
            When Morna informed them that they were being pursued by a lone TIE fighter and New Republic ships, Sloane told Pandion to buckle in. When he refused and attempted to hijack the ship, Sloane grabbed the flight stick out of Morna's grip and pushed the ship into a quick spin. This caused Pandion to lose his footing. While Morna righted the shuttle, Sloane fired her blaster at Pandion and threw him out of the cockpit. Under Sloane's orders, she detached the cockpit from the shuttle while Rae set the shuttle's hyperdrive matrix to self-destruct. Pandion was killed during the ensuing explosion while Norra, who was flying the TIE fighter, was wounded. Meanwhile, Morna and Sloane traveled to the Vanquish and returned to the Ravager in the Vulpinus Nebula.[1]
            Morna Kee was a loyal and competent Imperial pilot who served Admiral Rae Sloane following the Battle of Endor. She could fly several different ships including the Lambda-class shuttle and the yacht Golden Harp. Morna was familiar with the operating systems of Imperial starships. She was also knowledgeable of physical combat and used her combat skills to subdue Arsin Crassus' pilot in order to take control of his yacht.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Morna_Kee</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMornaKee</string></dict>
        <key>Qi'ra</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.376.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Qi'ra was a human female from the planet Corellia who lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire. She grew up on the streets along with Han as part of the White Worms. Though they were at first rivals, the two Scrumrats eventually fell in love and became lovers. Sometime after Qi'ra was made Head Girl by Lady Proxima, Han and Qi'ra attempted to escape with a vial of coaxium, but were separated at the Coronet Spaceport, Han got out but promised to return for her.
            Qi'ra was sold into slavery by Proxima to the slave dealer Sarkin Enneb, who eventually sold her to Dryden Vos, the public leader of Crimson Dawn. Vos trained Qi'ra in martial arts and prompted her to kill Enneb, branding her neck with the Crimson Dawn symbol and making her his most trusted lieutenant.
            In 10 BBY, Qi'ra reunited with Solo on Vandor and accompanied him and his friends on a mission to retrieve coaxium. She recommended a ship owned by the smuggler Lando Calrissian and rekindled her relationship with Solo. After the mission was unsuccessful, she returned to Vos, whom she betrayed and killed to save Han. Despite this, however, Qi'ra left Solo behind as she traveled to Dathomir to meet with Maul, the true leader of Crimson Dawn.
            Qi'ra hailed from the planet Corellia during the reign of the Galactic Empire, before the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War.[3] She grew up on the streets and became friends with Han.[1] By the time Qi'ra was eighteen years old, she was enmeshed in a criminal life working for the White Worms gang on Corellia.[3] She was chosen by Lady Proxima to be the Head Girl[2] after Han revealed to her that Qi'ra had turned down an opportunity to travel the galaxy, but to work for her instead.[4] Qi'ra attempted to flee Corellia with Han, by this point her lover, who had stolen a vial of coaxium during a delivery for Proxima that had gone badly. After a confrontation with Proxima, in which Solo caused a distraction by shattering a window allowing light in, exploiting her vulnerablility of her skin, he and Qi'ra attempted to escape through the Imperial control zone using the coaxium to bribe Falthina Sharest, an Imperial Emigration Officer. Sharest agreed to allow them through, provided they handed over the coaxium before passing through the security gate. Solo reluctantly agreed, and instructed Qi'ra to hand it over. However, only Solo got through, Qi'ra was captured by several members of the White Worms, and the gate closed when Sharest triggered a security alert. Solo promised Qi'ra he would come back for her as soon as possible before he ran away from the gate.[1]
            Qi'ra lived an even more difficult life after being captured again by Lady Proxima's gang. The blistered Proxima was displeased of her actions, opting to sell Qi'ra away. She was sold to a slave dealer, Sarkin Enneb, and later Dryden Vos, the leader of Crimson Dawn. After a year of failed escapes, she attempted to do so yet again, killing the guard outside her cell and reaching the escape pods, only to find Vos waiting. He offered her a position within the ranks of Crimson Dawn, having seen potential within her, but he demanded her lifelong loyalty in return. Vos later branded Qi'ra's forearm and the back of her neck with the Crimson Dawn symbol.[1]
            With Crimson Dawn, Qi'ra lived a more opulent lifestyle, becoming Vos' top lieutenant. She was trained by Vos in the martial arts of Teräs Käsi.[1]
            At some point during her employment with Crimson Dawn, Qi'ra found herself being pursued by bounty hunter droid IG-88 on Ord Mantell. Qi'ra fell into a trap laid by IG-88 and his temporary partner, Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka. The two were planning on turning Qi'ra in for a bounty, but she was able to turn them against one another, giving her a chance to remove her bonds and capture them both, with intent to turn them in for their bounties.[5]
            Qi'ra's association with Crimson Dawn brought her back into contact with Solo, who was working with Vos' associate Tobias Beckett in order to obtain a large quantity of refined coaxium. Qi'ra attended the meeting between Vos, Beckett, and Solo on Vos' yacht. Vos berated Beckett and Solo for failing to obtain the coaxium shipment on Vandor, and considered killing them until Solo suggested that they instead retrieve unrefined coaxium from the spice mines of Kessel. Qi'ra advised Vos that the plan would work, and he agreed to allow Beckett to try, the penalty for failure being death. Vos sent Qi'ra to accompany Beckett's crew to make sure the plan would work.[1]
            Knowing that they would need a particularly fast ship to transport the unrefined coaxium before it degraded and detonated, Qi'ra sought her old acquaintance, Captain Lando Calrissian of the Millennium Falcon. Qi'ra watched as Solo failed to win the Falcon at sabacc. However, Calrissian agreed to fly the Falcon for Qi'ra, Beckett, and Solo in exchange for a cut of the profits. En route to Kessel, Qi'ra and Solo rekindled their romance, kissing in the back of the Falcon.[1]
            Upon arriving at Kessel, Qi'ra masqueraded as a slaver, Oksana Floren, selling Han and Chewbacca to Quay Tolsite of Pyke Syndicate in order to infiltrate the mines. Qi'ra, Beckett, and L3-37 secured the control room, allowing Solo to steal the coaxium. Qi'ra initially served as Solo's co-pilot during the escape from Kessel, but was replaced by Chewbacca.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Qi%27ra</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemQi'ra</string></dict>

        <key>Kerra Holt</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.379.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kerra Holt was a female Human Jedi Knight during the New Sith Wars. She was the daughter of Aron and Mercia Holt but she was separated from her parents during the Sith invasion of Aquilaris. The former Padawan of Vannar Treece, Holt determined to make herself into a "living weapon" and, having done so, returned to the areas of the galaxy still controlled by the Sith, determined to fight them wherever she found them. The rival Sith Lord brothers Odion and Daiman, sons of the Sith lady Xelian, were two enemies she encountered. Later on, Holt found out that she was facing an almost entire family of Sith and intended to use this knowledge to warn to the Galactic Republic.
            Born on Aquilaris in 1050 BBY, Holt was raised by her family until the Sith invaded the planet. Her family perished in a massive raid led by the Sith Lord Odion, general of the Chagras Hegemony. After the Sith took control over her homeworld, she was rescued by Jedi Master Vannar Treece and taken to the Jedi Temple for training. She eventually reached the rank of Jedi Knight in 1032 BBY, and participated in a dangerous Jedi operation into the Sith-controlled Grumani sector. When her Master and Jedi comrades were killed by Odion on Chelloa, Holt was stranded but re-established contact with a former Jedi Knight, Gorlan Palladane.
            Together, the two Jedi succeeded in outmaneuvering both Daiman and Odion's malevolent schemes towards Chelloa. During the Destruction of Chelloa when Daiman unleashed kinetic corruptors which devastated the planet's surface, Holt and Palladane succeeded in evacuating much of the planet's population and escaped into hyperspace on a hastily assembled cargo fleet which became the Freedom Fleet. During her time on Chelloa, Holt earned the grudging respect of the narcissistic Daiman while gaining the animosity of Odion, following a climatic duel where he sustained serious wounds. Following the safe evacuation of the Chelloan people, Holt would continue her personal crusade against the Sith warlords in the Grumani sector.
            Her quest would lead her to infiltrate the Daimanate capital of Darkknell where she intended to destroy Daiman's Black Fang research installation before killing the Sith Lord himself. In the process, she encountered the Bothan spy Narsk Ka'hane, an independent operator who worked for several Sith Lords. Kerra would become embroiled in a plot by Daiman to lure Odion into a trap on Gazzari by leaking information about a business deal between him and the Quermian Sith Lord Ayanos Bactra, the ruler of the Bactranate. During a showdown on Gazzari, Kerra rescued around 1,700 students from the Daimanate who had been used as bait in the assault. She also came into contact with the mercenary leader Jarrow Rusher, the Brigadier of Rusher's Brigade, an independent mercenary operation. After successful convincing Rusher to evacuate the refugees, they escaped offworld to Byllura.
            On Byllura, Kerra and Rusher would help bring down the Dyarchy, a Sith realm ruled by the Krevaaki Sith Lord Saaj Calician, who ruled on behalf of the late Chagras's younger children Quillan and Dromika. The Dyarchy was subsequently annexed by the female Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra, their older sister and the ruler of the Arkadianate. Following the defeat of the Dyarchy, Kerra and Rusher came into contact with the female Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra, who offered them refuge at her capital city of Calimondretta on Syned. Arkadia attempted to win Kerra and Rusher over by portraying herself as an enlightened Sith ruler and promising refuge to the student refugees. Arkadia also revealed that the conflicts in Sith Space were driven by a fratricidal power struggle involving the Calimondra family, a feuding clan of power-hungry Sith lords headed by the matriarch Vilia Calimondra. Her seven children had undertaken a challenge known as a Charge Matrica to inherit her holdings, and now the grandchildren were doing the same.
            After her seven children declared war on each other, Chagras had emerged as the victor, but died mysteriously, leaving no single heir to claim Vilia's legacy. So, the grandchildren were now undertaking the same challenge as their parents, attempting to impress the Sith matriarch by warring against each other or eliminating Sith outsiders like Bactra or Calician. This self-centered power struggle affected the lives of billions of sentients throughout the Grumani sector. However, Kerra became caught up in a plot by Arkadia to kill her grandmother Vilia, and subsequently a counter-plot by Vilia to stop her granddaughter through the Bothan spy Narsk. After helping Narsk to foil Arkadia's schemes, Kerra and Rusher managed to escape Syned, bringing around two thousands refugees including Kerra's student refugees who had fled the Daimanate and many Arkadianate defectors. Vilia allowed Kerra to survive because she wanted the Jedi woman to provide her grandchildren with experience in dealing with Jedi.
            After recuperating from her travels in the safety of the Republic, Holt returned to her homeworld of Aquilaris after receiving a distress call. There, she would become embroiled in two separate conspiracies with malevolent intentions towards Aquilaris. Unsatisfied with Hutt Space, the ambitious Hutt crimelord Zodoh was intending to extend his operations to Sith Space and wanted to intimidate his Sith rivals with his improvised superweapon: Stormdrivers capable of creating global artificial floods. In the same vein, the pro-Republic Grace Command—an Alderaanian-based mercy organization—had deliberately inundated the Grumani sector with Deluge spice, as part of Operation Deluge to undermine the Sith war effort without diverting substantial Republic resources. However, it also wrecked the lives of many civilian populations.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kerra_Holt</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKerraHolt</string></dict>

        <key>Kaeden Larte</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.381.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kaeden Larte was a human female, the older sister of Miara Larte. After participating in the uprising on Raada in the early reign of the Galactic Empire, she eventually came to serve aboard a Rebel Alliance medical frigate.
            Kaeden's parents worked as farmers on the moon Raada until they died when Kaeden was about fourteen. Kaeden began working as a farmer under the crew lead Vartan, who looked out for her and her sister.[1]
            Kaeden befriended Ahsoka Tano when she arrived on Raada, under the false name 'Ashla', a mechanic. Kaeden helped her get settled in an abandoned house and helped her create a reputation for herself and her 'business'.[1]
            During the Uprising on Raada, Kaeden took part in a doomed raid on an Imperial base and was extracted by Ahsoka. In doing so, Ahsoka revealed her true identity as a former Jedi. Kaeden left their cave hideout in her anger over Ahsoka's deception and was captured by the Galactic Empire. She was tortured in preparation for interrogation, but Ahsoka rescued her before she revealed any information. After Ahsoka fled the moon, Kaeden stayed in the cave hideout with Miara and the other survivors of the raid until the Sixth Brother found them in his search for Ahsoka. The Sixth Brother captured Kaeden to lure Ahsoka back to Raada, which led to his defeat and death at Ahsoka's hands.[1]
            Ahsoka rescued her from her cell along with the other prisoners. When they were reuniting, Kaedan admitted her feelings towards Ahsoka. Kaeden and the rest of the Raada farmers were evacuated with the help of Bail Organa. Kaeden expressed a desire to join the rebellion once Miara was old enough to join with her.[1]
            After the evacuation of Raada, Kaeden and her sister were initially moved to a refugee camp on Alderaan. They both eventually joined the rebellion, taking different career paths. Kaeden went to medical school on Alderaan, and by 0 ABY she served aboard a Republic medical frigate. Due to the separation of their duties, she rarely saw Miara.[2]
            Kaeden was generally friendly and kind, despite the hardship of her life on Raada and losing her parents. Her bonds with her community were especially important to her, as she regarded them as her new family. She developed feelings for Ahsoka Tano, and trusted her despite the doubts of Miara and the other farmers.[1]
            Ahsoka Tano described Kaeden as having lighter skin than Master Windu, but darker skin than Rex. She usually kept her hair in braids, but would wear a scarf over her hair if unable to maintain them.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kaeden_Larte</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKaedenLarte</string></dict>
        <key>Tracene Kane</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.382.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tracene Kane was a female human who worked as a journalist on Chandrila during the Galactic Civil War. She was close friends with her cameraman, a Trandoshan named Lug, who perished during a battle at Binjai-Tin on the planet Nag Ubdur in 5 ABY. Tracene and her new Sullustan colleague Birt later recorded Chancellor Mon Mothma's press statement regarding the discovery of Imperial forces on Jakku prior to the Battle of Jakku.
            Tracene Kane was a female human journalist who lived during the Age of the Empire and the rise of the New Republic. Following the Battle of Endor, Kane joined the Queen of the Core Network, a HoloNet news network that had emerged with the rise of the New Republic. She and her colleague, the Trandoshan cameraman Lug, interviewed Olia Choko, the public relations representative for Chancellor Mon Mothma and the new Galactic Senate, which was then based on Chandrila's Hanna City.[1]
            Prior to the interview, Kane assured Olia that she would trend well because she was pretty and an alien. Choko then got Kane and Lug to position their camera behind Hanna City's cityscape and the stormtrooper helmet exhibit in the city circle. After Lug had positioned the camera, Kane commenced the new story with the announcement that this was the first day of the Queen of the Core Network. During the interview, Choko was struck in the face by a Xan man named Geeska Dotalo, who expressed frustration at the chaos, crime and famine caused by the fighting between the New Republic and the Galactic Empire on his homeworld of Gan Moradir.[1]
            When Kane told Lug to cut the filming, Choko told them to continue shooting the altercation. After listening to Dotalo's plight, Kane offered him a position as Gan Moradir's representative in the Galactic Senate and fetched another New Republic official to attend to Dotalo's needs. Kane and Lug continued filming as Choko confronted the New Republic Corporal Camerand Argell and chastised him for parading Imperial prisoners of war. She forced Agrell and his commanding officer, Commander Rohr, to end the humiliating parade.[1]
            Kane commended Choko for her work and then proceeded to ask whether the protestor, the orphans, and the parade of prisoners were danger signs for the nascent New Republic. Choko responded that the New Republic was a democracy and that they would try to get things right. Unlike the Empire which valued order over everything else, Choko reiterated that the New Republic was committed to the greater good. Choko then joined a procession of New Republic senators marching towards the old Chandrila Senate house. After Choko bid Kane farewell, Kane jokingly told Choko to "knock 'em dead."[1]
            Tracene Kane and Lug were later embedded with the New Republic Thirty-First, which was involved in the fighting at the city of Binjai-Tin on the planet Nag Ubdur in 5 ABY. Kane covered a mouth with a white cloth due to the stench of rotting bodies. Lug, whose species were accomplished hunters and warriors, was unperturbed by the carnage. The two worked with a cam droid to film a collapsed wall. When Kane asked Lug to look for someone to interview, the Trandoshan recommended Commander Norwich but Kane suggested a common soldier.[2]
            When Kane asked Lug about her hair and said that she was going for a battle-frizzled look, he reassured her that it was fine. About ten klicks away lay Imperial forces. Lug soon returned with a young Kupohan New Republic soldier named Private Rorith Khadur. Khadur recounted the fighting at Govneh Ridge and described how he and his men had discovered that Imperial forces had massacred the population of the Ubdurian city of Binjai-Tin. Kane watch Lug comfort the soldier and give him a zlagfiend tooth as a token.[2]
            Kane and Lug then proceeded to upload their story on a nearby guild tower. However, the embattled Imperial forces launched a TIE fighter suicide attack on the New Republic positions. Khadur lost one of his arms during the fighting while Lug was crushed to death by a stricken TIE fighter. Kane was distraught by the death of her friend and gave a broadcast in his honor.[2]
            After Temmin Wexley and Sinjir Rath Velus reported that the Empire had relocated to the Inner Rim world of Jakku, Tracene Kane and the Sullustan cam-operator Birt met for an exclusive interview with Chancellor Mothma. Before Mon Mothma issued her press statement, she took the time to chat with Miss Kane. When Kane told the Chancellor that she had been out in the field covering the war, Mothma asked why she had returned to cover politics. Kane replied that she could not look at war any longer. Mon agreed and remarked that war could seem like a present dream after looking too long into the abyssal eye of the political machine.[3]
            While Birt operated the hovering cam, Tracene listened as Mothma read her prepared statement. Mothma announced that she had yesterday learnt about the possibility that the Empire had retreated to Jakku. She also announced that the New Republic military had sent a scout ship Oculus under the command of Ensign Ardin Deltura and probe droids to investigate the Imperial presence. Mothma also mentioned that she was aware of the information leakage. The Chancellor then ended her speech by announcing that she had convened an emergency session of the Galactic Senate to mobilize the New Republic military.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tracene_Kane</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTraceneKane</string></dict>

        <key>Rook Kast</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.385.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rook Kast was a human female Mandalorian warrior who led the Shadow Collective's super commandos during the Clone Wars. After Darth Maul, leader of the Shadow Collective, was imprisoned by the Sith on Stygeon Prime, Kast and commando Gar Saxon freed Maul and brought him to a Shadow Collective base on Zanbar. They were tracked by the forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and, in the ensuing battle, forced to flee to Ord Mantell. From there, they repelled a Separatist attack. Kast and Maul captured the Droid Army general Grievous in orbit, while Maul's ground forces captured the Separatist leader, Count Dooku.
            The Shadow Collective took their prisoners to a Mandalorian asteroid base, which was assaulted by the Galactic Republic and Jedi Order in an attempt to capture Dooku themselves. Kast, Maul, Dooku, and some of Maul's forces fled and set a course for Dathomir. They were tracked by Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, who fought alongside Dooku and Grievous in destroying the Shadow Collective forces. Kast recovered Maul from the battle, and they fled the planet.
            A human female[2] born on the Outer Rim planet Mandalore, Rook Kast was the leader of the Mandalorian super commandos[1]—Mandalorian soldiers who served the Sith Lord Darth Maul and were a part of[5] his criminal alliance, the Shadow Collective,[6] during the Clone Wars.[5]
            In the year 19 BBY,[7] after Maul was bested in combat by his former master, Darth Sidious,[5] he was imprisoned in the Spire, a Confederacy of Independent Systems prison on the planet Stygeon Prime. Kast and Commander Gar Saxon followed Sidious and Maul to Stygeon, and were tasked by Mandalorian Prime Minister Almec,[4] whom Maul had selected as the public leader of Mandalore after his takeover of the planet,[8] with infiltrating the Spire and rescuing Maul. The pair dispatched two commando droids on the balcony of the prison's third level before updating the Prime Minister on their progress. After setting charges on the balcony entrance, Kast and Saxon entered the prison and made their way to level seven, where Maul was being held. As they approached his cell, they encountered a quartet of droidekas and several B2 super battle droids, but managed to deactivate the super battle droids and fire a missile at the droidekas, clearing the way to Maul's cell. Once Maul was freed, the two Mandalorians blew a hole in the prison wall and shot a zipline out towards their Gauntlet fighter, allowing the three to escape the planet and return to a Shadow Collective base on the moon of Zanbar. However, they were unaware that the Separatists had tracked them back to their base.[4]
            Sighting several incoming C-9979 landing crafts in Zanbar's atmosphere, Kast informed Maul that Separatist forces had arrived. The Zabrak ordered his troops to engage the Separatist Droid Army, resulting in a battle which saw heavy losses for both factions. As the battle neared its end, Maul engaged General Grievous, leader of the Droid Army, in a lightsaber duel. Kast, aboard Maul's Gauntlet fighter,[4] the Nightbrother,[9] ordered the pilot to lower the ship closer to Maul, allowing him to jump on board. Maul ordered Kast to take them away from the moon,[4] and the remaining troops at Zanbar regrouped with the larger Shadow Collective force and traveled to a Black Sun base on Ord Mantell.[2]
            In Ord Mantell City, Kast attended a meeting with Maul, Saxon, Black Sun leader Ziton Moj,[2] and Pyke Syndicate majordomo[10] Fife. Maul, knowing that Separatist leader Count Dooku, Grievous, and the Droid Army would be coming for them, laid out a plan for the other four on how to deal with the incoming Confederate forces. After receiving word that a shuttle from Dathomir had arrived, which was carrying Nightbrothers to aid the Shadow Collective, Maul and Saxon left to greet the shuttle, while Maul ordered Kast to inform the others of his plan. The Separatists forces soon arrived, bombarding the city from space before landing their own troops. As the Mandalorians, Black Sun, and Pykes engaged the Separatists on the planet surface, Maul and Kast took the Nightbrother into Ord Mantell's orbit and boarded Grievous's command ship. Maul stormed the ship's bridge and threatened to kill Grievous if he did not shut down the Separatist droids. Grievous complied, leading to a swift Shadow Collective victory which saw the capture of Grievous as well as Dooku, who had been battling the Nightbrothers on the surface of Ord Mantell.[2]
            The Shadow Collective took their captives back to[11] Vizsla Keep 09,[12] a Mandalorian supply outpost[11] hidden in the rings of Phelbos,[12] and Maul contacted his old master, Sidious, informing him of their capture. Maul ordered Kast to lock Grievous away in the outpost's brig while he spoke with Dooku. A Galactic Republic task force, led by Jedi Generals Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Tiplee, and Aayla Secura, soon arrived at the Keep and began to do battle with the Mandalorian forces. Kast informed Maul that the Jedi had arrived in the third hangar, prompting Dooku to temporarily ally himself with Maul. The two Sith began dueling the Jedi, quickly leading to the death of Master Tiplee. Kast fired a missile in Secura's direction, resulting in both her and Windu being rendered unconscious. Maul, Dooku, Kast, and Saxon retreated from the outpost aboard the Nightbrother[11] and traveled to Dathomir.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rook_Kast</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRookKast</string></dict>
        <key>Kira Carsen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.386.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kira Carsen was a Human female Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order during the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. During the Great Galactic War, she was born as a Child of the Sith Emperor, she fled Korriban as a child and sought refuge on Nar Shaddaa. There, she met Master Bela Kiwiiks of the Jedi High Council on Tython and was taken up as her Padawan, all the while keeping her dark past in the Sith Empire to herself.
            Later, Kira became the apprentice of the Hero of Tython, to help prevent the use of the Planet Prison weapon on Coruscant. However, the Sith Lord Darth Angral had stolen the weapon and both Jedi were sent to put a stop to his murderous campaign across the galaxy.
            When her secret was revealed in a confrontation with one of her former "siblings", Valis, she was brought to Tython to confess before the Council. Fortunately, her Master spoke on her behalf and convinced the Council to let her go. Kira was given a chance to prove her loyalty to the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic. When Master Bela Kiwiiks was kidnapped by the Sith on Tatooine, Kira rescued her former Master, and confessed to the past she had hidden for so long.
            Once the Jedi finally caught up with Darth Angral on the Oppressor above Tython, the Emperor took control of Kira and ordered Angral to attack the Hero of Tython. Angral was killed in the duel and the Emperor fought in his stead through Kira's body. But Kira was strong enough to push the Dark Lord's influence out of her before the Oppressor was destroyed. She was given the rank of Jedi Knight, a slave to the Empire no longer.
            Kira Carsen was born to Human parents on Dromund Kaas, in the territory of the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War. Early in her life, the Empire learned that Kira was Force-sensitive, and her parents were forced to give her up to the Sith academy on Korriban. At age six, she killed her first tuk'ata. However, during her time at the Academy, Carsen noticed that other children would disappear for unknown amounts of time. When they returned, they were different, unable to remember where they had been or sometimes who they or others were.[4]
            At some point, a ten-year-old[5] Carsen discovered she could not recall days or weeks of time and realized that she too had been taken. She became a Child of the Sith Emperor, meaning that the Emperor could possess her mind and body at will. Fearful of what the Emperor could do to her, she stowed away on a cargo ship headed out of Imperial space. She got off the ship when it stopped at Nar Shaddaa, where she spent years living in alleys and stealing to survive.[4] She joined a group of alien refugees in the High Security Lockdown, where she met the Evocii Enaq and the Anomid Darshyn.[6]
            Carsen spent the next eight years on Nar Shaddaa, using her nascent Force powers to defend herself and her friends. She would often bundle up in extra clothes to make herself look bigger, and was fiercely protective of her friends. When a street gang called the Ur'kossags began terrorizing the refugees, Kira paid the gang a visit. However, her attempt to negotiate with them ended poorly, and Carsen ended up killing several gang members. Carsen's actions backfired, however, causing everyone in the area to fear the refugee group's reputation. Carsen did not understand what she had done, because she left the planet not long after.[6]
            Carsen's life changed when she attempted to steal a hyperdrive engine from an expensive ship in the spaceport, of which she planned to disassemble and sell off the pieces. She did not realize, however, that the ship belonged to the Jedi Master Bela Kiwiiks, who was very surprised to catch Carsen in the middle of her planned theft. Master Kiwiiks quickly recognized Carsen's affinity for the Force and offered Carsen the opportunity to join the Jedi Order. Carsen decided her best hopes of ending the evils that the Sith Empire had committed, against herself and others, was with the Jedi Order and accepted an apprenticeship with Master Kiwiiks.[4]
            A couple of years later,[4] Carsen met the Padawan of Orgus Din, and they worked together to stop Tarnis from unleashing the Planet Prison. She chose to travel with her new partner, now a Jedi Knight, and Satele Shan made her the Padawan of the Hero of Tython after Bela Kiwiiks left on a lone assignment to Tatooine. Carsen was later captured by agents of Darth Angral on the Ord Mantell space station. Angral, who had sworn a vendetta against Carsen's new Master, demanded to know where the Knight was. Carsen misled him into believing that her Master was on Corellia. As Angral's retainers kept an eye on her, her new partner/master returned from the planet surface and freed her. Unfortunately, this allowed the Sith Emperor to find her at long last. He arranged for another Child, Valis to retrieve her.

        <key>Vestara Khai</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.388.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vestara Khai, also known by her alias Savara Raine, was a Force-sensitive female Human born to Sith Saber Gavar Khai and his wife, Lahka, on the remote planet Kesh in 27.5 ABY. She became a Tyro in the planet's local Sith Tribe in 37.5 ABY, and after being contacted by the Sith Meditation Sphere Ship in 41 ABY she was apprenticed to Lady Olaris Rhea. Ship helped the Tribe travel offworld and form a new fleet, but in 43.5 ABY Ship deserted Kesh, following the call of the dark side entity Abeloth. Vestara was a member of the strike team sent to recover Ship and kill Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, but the Sith were defeated by Skywalker and his son, Ben. The team's sole survivor, Vestara fled to the planet Dathomir, where she sent a message to her Tribe and lived under the protection of the Dathomiri Witches. The Skywalkers found and eventually captured her, but they were then confronted by a Sith fleet led by High Lord Sarasu Taalon.
            Taalon forced the Jedi to accept an alliance to confront Abeloth—who had proven to be a danger to the Sith, and who was causing a psychosis among the Jedi Order's Knights—with the stipulation that Vestara remained aboard the Skywalkers' family ship. During the mission, Vestara and Ben began to develop romantic feelings for each other, and she was instructed by her father to use them to her advantage against the Jedi. On Abeloth's planet, the Sith betrayed the Jedi, but Luke defeated Abeloth. The Khais, the Skywalkers, and Taalon repaired their alliance and remained behind to investigate more into Abeloth, but after discovering that the entity had survived, the alliance again fell apart. Gavar and Taalon sent Vestara to travel with and spy on the Jedi, and they tracked Abeloth to the moon Pydyr. A contingent of Sith soon arrived, and upon finding Abeloth, Taalon—who had begun to turn into the same kind of entity—opened battle on the Jedi.
            The Sith and Abeloth incapacitated the Jedi, but Vestara killed Taalon to prevent his transformation. Abeloth then escaped, and Vestara fled with the Jedi, as the Sith suspected her of betrayal. She and the Skywalkers then located Abeloth on the world Nam Chorios, and Vestara secretly informed her father of their location. However, Abeloth survived the assault and Vestara again assisted the Jedi in escaping from her Tribe. As the hunt for Abeloth continued, Vestara, the Skywalkers, and Jedi Knight Jaina Solo dueled a group of Sith, and Vestara was forced to kill her father. She finally decided to turn her back on the dark side and train as a Jedi, and she and Ben began a relationship. They soon embarked on a mission to hunt down Abeloth and Ship, but Vestara killed Jedi Knight Natua Wan in order to save Ben from a deadly insect that was determined to feed on him. The Jedi were forced to flee the world, and due to her actions, Vestara came to the conclusion that she would never be able to follow the Jedi path.
            Vestara nevertheless remained with the Jedi for their mission to eliminate the Sith on the planet Coruscant. She hoped to ensure the destruction of the Tribe's High Lords, who were duty-bound to kill her for Taalon's murder. However, during the mission she was separated from the Jedi, and she was forced to reveal the identity of a prophesied Jedi queen—the Skywalkers' relative, Allana Solo—in order to convince her Tribe that her loyalties remained with them. She was made a Sith Saber, and then forced to open an attack on Solo. Soon afterward, Abeloth captured Vestara and Ben Skywalker in Ship. Abeloth attempted to convince them to join her in forming a new family of the Ones—the powerful deities of whom Abeloth was the last surviving member, but they killed Abeloth while her other manifestations were defeated, resulting in her destruction. Knowing Ben would not forgive her betrayal of Solo, Vestara fled in Ship, who promoted her to Sith Lady and took her to join another faction of Sith.
            However, by 45 ABY, Vestara was in the employ of the Columi brothers, Craitheus and Marvid Qreph, who hired her to access a monolith in the Chiloon Rift. Using her Force powers, she was able to open a space–time-warping gate, granting access to the monolith. Upon entering the monolith, non Force-sensitive individuals could be granted access to the Force, a power which the Qreph brothers greatly desired. However, in Vestara's tests of the monolith's powers, their test subject had also become insane, forcing the Qrephs to prolong entering the monolith until they understood it better. In attempting to prevent anyone else from discovering the monolith, Vestara and the Qreph brothers drove competing interests out of the Chiloon Rift, but their efforts caused them to come into conflict with the Jedi. The Jedi, led by Ben Skywalker, attacked the Qrephs' base on the monolith, discovering that Vestara was working for the Qrephs. During the assault, Vestara was betrayed by her employers and left for dead. However, she was able to convince the Mandalorian, Mirta Gev, who was also working for the Qrephs, to join her, and the two women escaped from the monolith in Ship.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vestara_Khai</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemVestaraKhai</string></dict>

            Isabet Reau was eager to train the clones in the ways of the Death Watch's ideal Mandalorian, from their battle tactics to their cultural beliefs, so that the greatness of the Mandalorian people could once again sweep across the galaxy with all its power and glory. Along with her boyfriend, Dred Priest, she hosted a fight club in secret on Kamino. When clones started dying, Jango Fett put an end to it by badly injuring Priest.
            After the fall of the Galactic Republic, Priest and Reau were stationed on Mandalore where they were seen aiding the Imperial garrison there. They were soon noticed by Kal Skirata and his clan. After noticing the Death Watch insignia on their armor, an enraged Mij Gilamar attacked Priest above the river outside Keldabe and severed his femoral artery. Knowing Reau would be looking for Priest, Gilamar tossed his body into the river, hoping to delay her wrath.
            Reau was described as insane by Mij Gilamar and said to be worse than Priest by wanting the old days of a Mandalorian empire to be reborn.
            Reau wore yellow-and-gray armor with a yellow kama.

        <key>Jem Ysanna</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.393.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jem Ysanna was a female Human Jedi trainee. A member of the Ysanna tribe from the planet Ossus, Jem was the descendant of Jedi who had survived the destruction of Ossus by the Cron Supernova. As such, Jem was Force-sensitive and used her powers as a shamaness of her tribe, led by her father, Chief Okko. In 10 ABY, Jem was encountered by the Jedi, Luke Skywalker and Kam Solusar, who had come to Ossus to search for Jedi artifacts to help in their fight against the Galactic Empire. Upon sensing Skywalker's power in the Force, Jem and her brother Rayf Ysanna asked to train with Skywalker to become Jedi Knights. After agreeing to train the siblings, Skywalker took Jem and Rayf for training and departed Ossus in his ship, Jedi Explorer.
            Alongside her brother, Jem received instruction in lightsaber combat and telekinesis on her path to becoming a Jedi. During her training, Jem fell in love with Skywalker and the two began a relationship. As Jem and Skywalker began to entertain the idea of a future together, their thoughts were interrupted by an attack by the Galactic Empire. During the fighting, Jem was wounded by a blaster bolt from Tedryn-Sha, a member of Emperor Palpatine's Dark Side Elite. Although she was immediately avenged by Leia Organa Solo, Jem had sustained fatal injuries. The Jedi healer, Vima-Da-Boda, attempted to save her, but Jem succumbed to her injuries after bidding her final farewell to her brother. Upon her death, Jem became one with the Force, her body dissipating into nothingness.
            Jem Ysanna was born on the planet Ossus[1] in 13 BBY.[2] Jem and her brother, Rayf Ysanna, were the offspring of Okko,[1] a Chief of the Ysanna tribe on Ossus. Okko was the most powerful magician in the history of the Ysanna,[2] which had been formed from the descendants of Jedi who were unable to escape the destruction of the world by the Cron Supernova.[6] As children, Jem and Rayf would explore the tunnels on their world, learning as much as they could about Ossus.[7]
            In 10 ABY, Jem was a shamaness,[2] and as a child of "The Great Okko", Jem and her brother Rayf were scheduled to undergo an initiation ritual in front of their fellow tribe members.[1] As part of the ritual of ascent, Jem and Rayf were tied to the base of an ancient tree, to imbue them with Ysanna magic, believing that the tree was a source of power.[8] Before the ritual could be completed, it was interrupted by the Jedi, Luke Skywalker and Kam Solusar. Skywalker and Solusar had come to Ossus in their ship, the Jedi Explorer to seek out other Jedi. While exploring the world in a T-77 Experimental Airspeeder, the two Jedi noticed the ritual, and Skywalker sensed great Force power in both Jem and Rayf. Eager to take the pair as Jedi students, Skywalker ignited his lightsaber, intending to sever the ropes that secured them to the base of the tree. Jem and Rayf, only fluent in the native Ysanna language and unable to understand Skywalker's intent, were terrified of the Jedi warrior, believing that he intended to kill them. When Skywalker instead cut them loose, they fled in terror back to their Ysanna tribe members who had gathered to witness the ritual.[2]
            With the ritual disrupted, Okko ordered his people to attack the two interlopers. As Jem climbed on the back of her father's riding beast, the Ysanna fired on Skywalker and Solusar. However, their attacks were easily repelled, forcing Okko to deal with the intruders personally. Jem and her fellow Ysanna attempted to add their untrained Force powers to Okko as he tried to attack with The Force, but Okko was no match for Skywalker's powers. However, after having his powers easily blocked, Okko came to the realization that Skywalker was a spiritual descendant of the Ysanna ancestors. The great chief embraced Skywalker and declared to the rest of the tribe that Skywalker was a Jedi, the heroes of the Ysanna legends. Unfortunately for Skywalker and the Ysanna, the celebration was swiftly interrupted by the arrival of an Imperial Hunter ship, Scourge One. Through the Force, the Ysanna instinctively knew that this ship contained enemies, and as Imperial stormtroopers filed out of the ship, the Ysanna prepared for battle.[2]
            With Skywalker leading them, the Ysanna engaged the Imperials. From the back of her father's riding beast, Jem fired a concussion bow at the invaders, driving the stormtroopers back. As the Ysanna concentrated their fire on the Imperials, Skywalker and Solusar attacked with their lightsabers. After twenty minutes of intense fighting, the Imperial force was wiped out. However, the Imperial commanders, Executor Sedriss QL and Vill Goir exited Scourge One to continue the attack. Sedriss and Goir, both members of Emperor Palpatine's Dark Side Elite, were skilled users of the dark side of the Force and they met the Jedi in lightsaber combat. However, the Jedi proved more powerful, killing Goir and disarming Sedriss. Sedriss, the only remaining Imperial, refused to surrender and took Jem hostage. Holding her by the throat, Sedriss backed up against the very same tree that Jem had previously been tied to.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jem_Ysanna</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJemYsanna</string></dict>

        <key>Kendy Idele</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.396.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kendy Idele was a female human from the planet Iloh. She was chosen to attend the Royal Imperial Academy and shared a room with Jude Edivon and Ciena Ree. At the Academy, she was noted for her excellent skills with a blaster, being able to shoot three flying targets in just one second. After graduating from the Academy, she served the Galactic Empire. After the Battle of Hoth, her entire patrol mutinied on Miriatin, but only one-third of them managed to escape with their lives. She then joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic and became a member of Corona Squadron, joining Thane Kyrell, who was also a former Royal Imperial Academy student. She served in the Battle of Endor, where her job was to protect the other squadrons as they penetrated the Death Star. After the Battle of Endor, she would go on to serve in the New Republic.
            Kendy Idele grew up on the tropical planet of Iloh during the Age of the Empire. At the age of sixteen, Kendy became an Imperial cadet at the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant. She shared a room with the Jelucani cadet Ciena Ree and the Bespin cadet Jude Edivon. Kendy and Jude debated the merits of walking barefoot on Coruscant before Ciena joked that she and Kendy would get used to Jude's habit of quoting statistics. Kendy apologized for her grumpy mood and struggled with braiding her hair. Ciena helped her fellow cadet and taught her how to braid her hair. When Jude suggested that she keep her hair short, Kendy responded that only small children kept their hair short on Iloh. Later, they attended an induction ceremony hosted by Commandant Deenlark.[1]
            As the months passed, Kendy and her fellow cadets learned how to fire blasters. During a blaster training exercise, Kendy told her friend Ciena that she had noted the latter's interest in a male cadet named Thane Kyrell, a close friend of Ciena and a native of Jelucan. When Kendy asked Ciena whether she was romantically interested in Thane, Jude interjected that romantic relationships between cadets were forbidden at the Royal Imperial Academy. As the exercise dragged on, Kendy twirled her blaser like a pirate from a spice-runner holo.[1]
            Following a martial arts training exercise, Kendy joked about breaking the Academy's ban on romantic relationships for a guy as handsome as Thane; knowing Ciena's close friendship with him. When Kendy asked Ciena what she was going to do on their free day, Ciena expressed her desire to eat real food instead of the Academy's nutritive beverages. After Jude recommended that they spend their free time visiting the Museum of Multispecies Sciences, Kendy expressed her desire to dive in the sea instead of a wave pool. Before exiting the room, Ciena asked Kendy if she could show her how to flip her opponent. Kendy jokingly declined the offer on the grounds that she was better in that area than Ciena.[1]
            As the years passed, Kendy and Jude excelled in their studies at the Royal Imperial Academy, particularly the Core Worlds Classical Culture program. Prior to graduation, Kendy joked with Ciena and Jude, who had been invited to attend a ball at the Imperial Palace, about wearing Imperial uniforms. Jude responded that Imperial uniforms were not appropriate for civilian functions such as the ball.[1] Before the ball, Jude along Kendy took Ciena to a dresses rental shop, there they helped Ciena pick a dress for the ball.[2] After Kendy loaned Ciena her iridescent combs made of shells from Iloh and simple pearl earrings. After graduating, Kendy joined the Imperial Navy.[1]
            In Imperial service, Kendy was never posted to a Star Destroyer. She only visited the capital ship three times for day trips. Kendy turned against the Galactic Empire after the Empire destroyed the planet Alderaan with the Death Star. Following the Battle of Hoth, Kendy and her entire patrol mutinied on Miriatin but only one-third of them managed to escape with their lives. She later joined the Rebel Alliance and became a member of the X-wing starfighter Corona Squadron, earning the call sign Corona Five. Kendy's fellow pilots included her former Academy classmate Thane, Smikes, and the Twi'lek pilot Yendor. Later, she and her fellow Corona Squadron pilots attended a briefing chaired by the Alliance Chancellor Mon Mothma. Mothma ordered Corona Squadron not to accompany the rest of the Alliance Fleet to their new rendezvous point.[1]
            Kendy and her fellow Corona Squadron pilots scouted the Outer Rim planet of D'Qar for any possible sign of a new Imperial outpost. The Alliance had received information from deep-cover spies on Coruscant that massive amounts of materiel were being processed for the Imperial Starfleet. She informed Thane that there were no artificial power sources on D'Qar. After determining that the planet had no Imperial presence, Corona Squadron decided to list the planet as a potential rebel base for the future.[1]
            After returning to the rebel ship Liberty, Kendy told Thane that intelligence work was not as glamorous and dramatic as she thought it would be. Thane responded that the dramatic stuff was most likely to get them killed. When Thane remarked that he was not suicidal, Kendy pointed out that their old friend Ciena had one said that. Unlike Kendy and Thane, Ciena was still loyal to the Galactic Empire and was a promising Imperial Navy officer. When Thane asked what Ciena had reported, Kendy revealed that Ciena had reported that he had supposedly committed suicide on Jelucan. Kendy had learnt this information from her former classmates.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kendy_Idele</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKendyIdele</string></dict>
        <key>Iden Versio</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.397.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Iden Versio was a human female soldier who served in the military of the Galactic Empire. A TIE fighter pilot in the Imperial Starfighter Corps, Iden became Commander of Inferno Squad, an Imperial Special Forces commando unit assembled by her father, Admiral Garrick Versio, in response to the destruction of the Death Star. Along with Agents Gideon Hask, Del Meeko, and Seyn Marana, she infiltrated the Dreamers and successfully destroyed them, though Marana died in the mission. Inferno Squad would later go on to participate in and conduct special operations for the Empire in the Galactic Civil War, and, in 4 ABY, participated in the Battle of Endor, which saw the death of Emperor Palpatine and the destruction of the second Death Star, resulting in the fracturing of the Empire with the lack of a line of succession and broken chain of command.
            In the immediate aftermath of the battle, the secret Contingency was activated, and Messenger droids carried the final posthumous orders of the Emperor to select Imperial officers, among them Admiral Versio: Operation: Cinder was to begin at once. However, when climate disruption arrays targeted the Versio homeworld of Vardos as part of Operation: Cinder, Iden and Meeko both went rogue, escaping aboard the Corvus and surrendering to the Rebel Alliance. Iden and Meeko both agreed to help the Rebellion combat Operation: Cinder at the Battle of Theed, and ultimately decided to defect to the Rebellion and join the New Republic.
            Retaining her rank of Commander of Inferno Squad, Iden fought against the Imperial remnants throughout the final year of the Galactic Civil War, making attempts to capture Hask and her father. Inferno fought at the Battle of Jakku, where Iden and Shriv Suurgav answered several distress calls and fought against Hask, who was shot down by Iden. She later attempted to save her father aboard the Eviscerator, but her father declined her rescue attempt, choosing to go down with his ship, though made peace with Iden in his final moments. Iden fled in an escape pod, crash landing on Jakku and reuniting with Del and Shriv.
            Iden and Del went on to marry and had a daughter named Zay Versio. Twenty-nine years after the Battle of Jakku, Del went missing, and Iden, accompanied by Shriv and Zay, went in search of him. This led them back to Vardos, where they were met by Hask, who had survived the Battle of Jakku and become an officer of the First Order. He revealed to her that he had killed Del; and during a skirmish aboard his Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Retribution, during which they stole schematics for the First Order Dreadnought, he attempted to kill Zay as well, but Iden killed him first. Before his death, however, he managed to fatally wound her. Iden died in her daughter's arms as the Retribution came out of hyperspace into the Battle of Starkiller Base. Zay and Shriv went on to deliver the plans for the First Order dreadnought to the Resistance, whereupon Poe Dameron used them to take down the Fulminatrix during the evacuation of D'Qar.
            Iden Versio was born and raised on the planet Vardos during the era of the Galactic Empire. She was the daughter of Garrick Versio, an admiral in the Imperial Security Bureau; and Zeehay Versio, an artist who contributed to the design of propaganda posters. Following in her father's example, Iden trained to become a soldier of the Empire, and to that end attended the Future Imperial Leaders Military Preparatory School on Vardos, and following that enrolling in the Imperial Academy on Coruscant, the Imperial capital world. Versio later graduated from the Imperial Academy with honors, at the top of her class.[1]
            Assigned to the Death Star as a Senior Lieutenant, Versio was present for the Destruction of Jedha City[1] in 0 BBY,[4] in which Jedha City, an ancient city located on the desert moon Jedha, was destroyed by the Death Star's superlaser. The ensuing destruction also obliterated the ancient Temple of the Kyber, and killed Saw Gerrera and his group of rebels known as the Partisans.[1]
            Shortly after the destruction of Jedha City, Versio was present for the Battle of Scarif, in which the Death Star's superlaser was used to destroy an Imperial facility which had been infiltrated by rebels, who sought to steal the Death Star plans which were present at the Imperial facility. The ensuing blast wiped out an entire region, along with several rebel ships which had been trapped within Scarif's shield, though rebels on the ground were able to transmit a copy of the plans to a rebel ship in orbit. The plans were then transferred to a blockade runner under the command of Princess Leia Organa.[5][1]
            After the capture of Organa, her home planet Alderaan was chosen by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin as a suitable test of the Death Star's superlaser. Upon its arrival in the Alderaan system, the superlaser was charged, and on Tarkin's order fired, destroying Alderaan.[6] As most personnel aboard the Death Star had been ordered to do, Versio observed the destruction of Alderaan.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Iden_Versio</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemIdenVersio</string></dict>

During her time as a Jedi, Zane wielded a yellow-bladed lightsaber.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Mavra Zane was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. Constructing a yellow-bladed lightsaber and growing strong in the Jedi arts under the tutelage of Grand Master Yoda, Zane achieved the rank of Jedi Master and was appointed as an instructor at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. As the threat of separatism grew in the Galactic Republic's Senate, and the discovery of the reemergence of the Sith on Naboo loomed large, the Jedi High Council saw a need to expand their training program across the galaxy. Selecting a group of Jedi Masters, the Council dispatched them with groups of Padawans to open new academies. Master Zane was selected and tasked with leading a group of students to the forested world of Kashyyyk, where she would instruct her students in the ways of the Force.[1]
            Traveling aboard a Consular-class cruiser with her students, Zane and her charges arrived on Kashyyyk where they met with Masters Yoda, Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Together, Yoda and Zane oversaw the younglings' training. Shortly after their arrival on the world, the chapter house and nearby village were attacked by Trandoshan slavers and the armies of the Commerce Guild. During the first assault, a group effort by the Jedi and the Wookiees scattered their attackers and bought time for the Jedi to regroup. Master Yoda used the lull in the fighting to return to Coruscant in hopes of divining the political causes of the attacks.[1]
            Shortly after Yoda left, Zane and her students were forced into battle again. Assisted by a Wookiee named Chewbacca a small group escaped the attack, but Zane and many other students were taken captive. After a brief encounter with the Sun Guard, the students who'd escaped boarded a ship called the Starrunner, and flew into space to chase after the slavers holding Zane and the other Jedi captive. Receiving a transmission from Masters Yoda and Windu via hologram, the Jedi were notified that Zane and the other captives had been taken to a prison facility above the planet Felucia.
            Aboard a Providence-class capital ship, Zane managed to free herself while her escaped Padawans fought their way through the ship's hangar bay to the other imprisoned students. Soon, the Jedi discovered that the Commerce Guild was amassing a huge army to stage an attack on one of the Core Worlds. Realizing that the information needed to reach the High Council, Zane was able to meet up with the Padawans and ward off an attack by Sun Guards and IG-100 MagnaGuards. Upon destroying the ship's reactor core, Zane and her students boarded the Starrunner, escaping. Taking critical damage, the ship crash landed on the planet below.[1]
            Evading enemy combatants, Zane led her students to the planet's resistance stronghold. The native Felucians, under the leadership of a Human named Mak Pra, planned to storm the enemy's base. Agreeing to assist the resistance, Master Zane and her students infiltrated Presidente Shu Mai's stronghold. Discovering that Mai hoped to weaponize the dangerous chemical Trihexalon for an attack on Coruscant itself, Zane and her students attempted to escape the compound with this knowledge but were captured by the Gossam. Presidente Mai ordered the Jedi to be executed and escorted them to the mouth of a massive sarlacc. Before the Jedi could be disposed of, Master Yoda arrived with Republic reinforcements and freed the Jedi.[1]
            During the fighting, the Jedi were engaged by two Zabrak Dark Acolytes, one of whom was named Ror, and were able to defeat them at the cost of allowing Mai to escape. Zane led the chase into space, determined to stop the Gossam before she reached Coruscant. After a brief conflict over
            Felucia, the Commerce Guild's fleet jumped to the capital and the Jedi and the Republic were forced to follow. Flying as Red Leader, Zane led her squad to destroy the Commerce Guild's fleet, successfully ending the threat to Coruscant. Returning to the Jedi Temple, Master Zane elevated her students to the rank of Jedi Knight with the permission of the High Council.[1]
            Mavra Zane was portrayed by veteran voice actress Jennifer Hale and motion capture actress/martial artist Michelle Lee.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mavra_Zane</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMavraZane</string></dict>
        <key>Salla Zend</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.400.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Salla Zend was a Human female who was the ex-girlfriend of Han Solo. She and cohort Shug Ninx later helped Solo and his wife New Republic Senator Leia Organa Solo save Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and foil the reborn Emperor Palpatine's plan to control the galaxy from Byss years after the Battle of Yavin with her remarkably fast ship, the Starlight Intruder (which Zend often claimed was faster than the Millennium Falcon, but in a number of races with the Falcon, the Intruder never came out on top).
            Zend was originally a student with a true gift for fixing and modifying machinery, yet she didn't seek training to become an engineer or a technician, preferring to become a spaceship mechanic aboard a corporate vessel. Eventually, she saved up enough money for a loan, with which she bought her own ship.
            Her first time on Nar Shaddaa was eventful, with her getting into a fight with a smuggler named "Jump," who tried to romance her at first, but then tried to be rough; his roughness only got him a dislocated shoulder. Tweaking out her vessel, the Rimrunner, Zend began repaying the debt by smuggling with Han Solo.[2]
            She was one of the many smugglers who fought in the Battle of Nar Shaddaa where she and Lando Calrissian in the Millennium Falcon were partnered up. During the battle, she personally destroyed three Guardian-class light cruisers with her ship's concussion missiles.[2]
            A race with Solo past a neutron star almost ended in disaster when her hyperdrive failed and Solo nearly died rescuing her. Disturbed by the narrow miss, Zend wished to marry Solo, but he refused and said goodbye to her.[3] She later partnered up with Shug Ninx.[4]
            Salla Zend and the Starlight Intruder first appeared in the third issue of the Dark Empire series, The Battle for Calamari.
            Vocal actress Glynnis Talken played Salla in the 1994 Dark Empire audio drama. In 1995, Talken acted out Salla again in the Dark Empire II audio drama.
            Although the first edition of The Essential Guide to Characters would firmly establish Salla's species as Human, she does have a "purr" and slight alien reverb to her voice in these audio adaptations.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Salla_Zend</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSallaZend</string></dict>
        <key>Zay Versio</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.401.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zay Versio was a human female starfighter pilot who lived during the era of the New Republic. She was the daughter of Del Meeko and Iden Versio, as well as the granddaughter of Garrick and Zeehay Versio on her mother's side of the family. Despite her family's past ties to the Galactic Empire, Zay and Iden fought against the First Order after Meeko was executed by Gideon Hask during the waning days of the cold war. Hask was ultimately killed by Meeko's family, although Zay lost her mother as well. After the destruction of Starkiller Base, General Leia Organa instructed Zay to find allies for the Resistance in the Outer Rim Territories.
            Born sometime before the mission to Pillio,[1] Zay Versio[2] was the daughter of Del Meeko and Iden Versio.[1]
            During the cold war, Zay and her mother, Iden Versio, were piloting X-wing starfighters through an asteroid field when Shriv Suurgav, Versio's Rebel comrade whom Zay regarded as an uncle, told them to come to the Corvus regarding something urgent. Suurgav told them that Zay's father, Del Meeko, was missing, and they set out to find him. This led them to Athulla, where they were contacted by an Athullan who asked if they had his people, only to realize Meeko was not there. Before they could learn anything beyond the name "Project Resurrection," the transmission was cut off by a Jinata Security fleet under the command of Leema Kai, who led the kidnappings of Athullans.[1]
            She and Iden then went to their X-wings - a dogfight ensued between the Corvus, Iden, Zay, and J-Sec, who were using starfighters from the Clone Wars. During the dogfight, Iden shot down three modified GR-75 medium transports and disabled Leema's flagship, the Opportunity, while Zay drew attention away from Iden. This prompted Leema to engage them in a heavily modified Naboo starfighter armed with seismic charges. When Leema Kai was killed, Zay told Iden the Opportunity had surrendered as she threatened to fire the Corvus's concussion missiles all at once, but revealed to Iden it was a bluff.[1]
            They later discovered fully what Project Resurrection was and that Protectorate Gleb was holding Del prisoner on Vardos, Iden's homeworld, which had been devastated by Operation: Cinder thirty years ago. Zay stayed on the Corvus, as Iden didn't want her to "stare her mother's past in the face". Not long after, the Corvus was shot down by the Retribution, Gideon Hask's flagship, in an attempt to kill her, but she had gotten out in an escape pod just before the ship crashed and was destroyed. She then ripped out the pod's distress beacon and set up a makeshift sniper's nest, firing on both Jinata Security and First Order troops. She was later relieved when Shriv and Iden found her. When the fighting was over, Iden told Zay that Hask had killed Del and that she would find a way onto his Star Destroyer and get revenge, but Zay talked her out of it, stating it wouldn't bring him back. The plan was altered to boarding the ship to get any intelligence for the Resistance. They then set off to the ship in stolen TIE fighters, flying in sync with other TIEs while Iden's ID10 seeker droid, Dio, scanned for possible entrances. But their cover was blown, and a dogfight ensued. Dio later found an opening through a heating port by the starboard engines, so they blasted it open and flew in just as the Star Destroyer prepare to jump to hyperspace.[1]
            Successfully boarding the ship, the trio made its way into a small command room, where Shriv discovered the schematics for a Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought but couldn't get the schematics to the Resistance while the ship was in hyperspace. So Iden devised a plan to force the ship out of hyperspace by destroying the hyperdrive, while Shriv went to find an escape ship. Zay jokingly commented that she understood why Shriv was a nervous wreck around her. After fighting to an armory and grabbing explosive charges, they fought their way to the hyperdrive. There, she began placing charges on key areas while Iden covered her from incoming stormtroopers. Before heading to the last area, Dio began diverting reinforcements so they had a clear path, but just after Iden finished planting the final charge, Hask snuck up on her and held her at gunpoint, taunting Iden to shoot him. But she threw down her weapon, as she didn't want to risk hitting Zay. Disappointed with her cowardice, he prepared to shoot Iden, but Zay broke free of his grasp and redirected his shots before falling off the catwalk. Iden grabbed her at the last minute and threw her back up before Hask went to finish off Iden, but Zay tossed her pistol to her mother, and Hask was shot off the catwalk and down into the hyperdrive core, killing him and avenging her father.[1]
            Zay and Iden made their way to an observation room and set off the charges, ripping open a hole underneath the ship and forcing it out of hyperspace prematurely. Happy that the plan worked, Iden suddenly collapsed in pain, revealing she had been shot by a stray bolt from Hask's blaster. Worried and saddened, Zay tried to figure out a way to help her mother, but Iden told her it was too late for her, telling her that as long as they stayed strong and kept fighting, even if it meant dying, they would make a difference. After telling her she needed to get Dio to the Resistance and saying she loved her, Iden succumbed to her wound and died, leaving Zay devastated and alone with Dio before watching Starkiller Base implode into a star. Shriv then contacted them, stating he found a ship but it'd be a tight fit only for Zay to tell him Iden was dead. Remembering Iden's last words, they arrived at D'Qar, the Resistance headquarters, as it was evacuating and had a short conversation with General Leia Organa, a rebel veteran and the Resistance leader. She gave her sympathy upon hearing of Iden's death but asked for her help in finding the Resistance's allies in the Outer Rim Territories, to which she agreed. Leia then wished them good luck.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zay</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemZayVersio</string></dict>

            During her career, Zalin was very loyal to the Galactic Republic and was once partners with Sagoro Autem, but was promoted instead of him due to his desire to keep away from a desk job. She got the popularity and thus increased from active duty to the future to take on various administrative tasks.
            In 23 BBY, Zalin later commanded the Guard unit that Autem and his new partner, Isaru Omin, were assigned to. Her unit was assigned the task of investigating the murder of Senator Jheramahd Greyshade.

        <key>Jenna Zan Arbor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.403.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jenna Zan Arbor was a Human female, and a deranged scientist from the planet of Ventrux. Throughout her career, she had numerous confrontations with the Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker. During the Clone Wars, she was a leading scientist working for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. When the war had ended, she had been drafted into working for the new Galactic Empire.
            At the beginning of her career, Jenna Zan Arbor was a famed scientist and the head of Arbor Industries. She was known for saving a planet from a pandemic after creating a vaccine for a deadly virus. Zan Arbor was also known to help planets with little technology such as Melasaton overcome their burdens. However, nobody knew that she actually started the problems in the first place, to gain credits and improve her reputation.[1]
            Zan Arbor became interested in how the Force worked and began conducting experiments. She had connections to the senator of Belasco, Uta S'orn who kept her dark deeds quiet in the Galactic Senate. Unbeknownst to Senator S'orn, her son Ren, who was Force-sensitive (although his mother had taken him away from the Jedi Order when she was unable to cope with losing him) was being studied by Zan Arbor. These experiments lead to Ren's death, something Zan Arbor didn't expect. Feeling somewhat remorseful, she felt she needed a subject stronger in the Force,[1] so she hired a bounty hunter, Ona Nobis, to capture the "retired" Jedi Master Noor R'aya and bring him to her research facility on Simpla-12.[8] Then, weeks later, another Jedi named Qui-Gon Jinn was knocked out by Nobis in the Cascardi Mountains on Duneeden.[3] He was taken to the laboratory, where Zan Arbor tortured him to the point of near death.[1]
            However, Qui-Gon was rescued by Obi-Wan Kenobi, along with Astri Oddo, who was disguised as Ona Nobis. Yet Zan Arbor warned the Jedi that she had another in custody—Noor R'aya—and threatened to inject him with poison should Qui-Gon leave the building.[1] She killed her assistant, Nil, as he was a liability. Zan Arbor then made plans to leave the planet, contacting Cholly, Weez and Tup, who were droid dealers to arrange shipment of battle droids. But the trio were helping Obi-Wan, Siri Tachi and Adi Gallia get into her lab.[8]
            With the droids all destroyed, Zan Arbor escaped the planet with Noor. She fled to Belasco, where she engineered a virus from natural waterborne organisms on the planet. She planned to infect the populace through their water supply, designing the bacteria to proliferate if threatened. With S'orn's help, she was able to infiltrate the containment facilities to introduce the bacteria. The Jedi caught up to her, with the data to cure Belasco. As Qui-Gon trapped her under a tapestry, she deeply regretted that she didn't kill him when she had the chance. Both Zan Arbor and Uta S'orn were sent to a penal colony for life. The solution for the bacteria Zan Arbor introduced was found on her datapad and the water was fixed.[8]
            Around 25 BBY, Zan Arbor somehow escaped the penal colony. She settled on the planet Vanqor and began perfecting a drug known as the Zone of Self-Containment. With this drug, she was able to capture Anakin Skywalker and many other innocent people; however, she was forced to flee Vanqor when Obi-Wan Kenobi, Siri Tachi and Ferus Olin came to rescue Anakin. Fleeing Vanqor, Zan Arbor teamed up with Granta Omega who agreed to fund her next project.[9] She went into hiding on Romin, under the protection of Roy Teda and her Phlog bodyguard Hue. When Teda was overthrown, the Jedi came to capture them, but they escaped yet again.[10]
            In 24 BBY, Zan Arbor then constructed the Blackwater Systems facility on Falleen to create machines that would be used to spread the Zone of Self-Containment. The Jedi once again foiled her plot and she was forced to destroy the facility. The Jedi chased her to Coruscant, where she and Granta Omega orchestrated a failed attempt to assassinate Supreme Chancellor Palpatine,[5] and finally to Korriban, where she and Omega were cornered by the Jedi in the 23 BBY. When the Jedi killed Omega, Zan Arbor fled.[11] She went into hiding and went unnoticed by both the Jedi and the Republic. That same year, when Count Dooku publicly declared the formation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Zan Arbor was hired to be one of their leading scientists.[6][12]
            Now a scientist for the Separatists, Zan Arbor created devastating agents of biological warfare. A few months before the Battle of Geonosis, she worked with Arkanian genetic researchers to create the stone mites, insects that could devour entire buildings in mere hours. These stone mites were unleashed on a number of worlds.[12]
            Two months into the Clone Wars, Zan Arbor successfully perfected a deadly gas poison that was used to wipe out the entire Gungan colony on the Naboo moon of Ohma-D'un.[6][13] A form of this same gas was incorporated into the defense mechanism of Viceroy Nute Gunray's mechno-chair.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jenna_Zan_Arbor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJennaZanArbor</string></dict>

When encroaching Imperial patrols forced the rebels to scuttle the base and the Yellow Aces to be disbanded, Dinnes, along with Jek Tono Porkins and two other pilots were transferred to the Rebel base on Yavin 4 where Dinnes and Porkins were assigned to Red Squadron, with Dinnes obtaining the callsign Red Eight.[3] She was shot down and died during the Battle of Yavin.[2]
            Zal Dinnes was a human female with blonde hair and hazel eyes.[3] Dinnes had "V"s inside the yellow dots that ran along her helmet that indicated enemy fighter kills. Each mark equaled 20 enemy fighters that she killed in battle.[4]

            This name was given to the unnamed mother of Teneniel by The Essential Guide to Characters and was picked up by Star Wars Encyclopedia. It's possible that this person may also be the same person as Kara'Teel, the youngest daughter of Augwynne named in Cracken's Threat Dossier.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Allaya_Djo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAllayaDjo</string></dict>
        <key>Teneniel Djo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.408.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Teneniel Djo was a member of the Singing Mountain Clan of the Witches of Dathomir who eventually became the Queen Mother of the Hapes Consortium.
            Raised by her grandmother Augwynne Djo after her mother Allaya's untimely death, Teneniel was gifted in the use of the Spell of Storm. After living in semi-exile in the desert while searching her dreams and looking for a husband to kidnap, she came across Luke Skywalker and the Hapan Prince Isolder, the latter of whom she eventually married.
            After Isolder's mother Ta'a Chume stepped down as Queen Mother, Teneniel and Isolder reigned over the Hapes Consortium for approximately seventeen years. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Teneniel suffered a Force-induced miscarriage that left her semi-catatonic and vulnerable to attacks from many who had deemed her unfit to rule. In 27 ABY, Ta'a Chume had Teneniel executed, and her daughter Tenel Ka succeeded her as Queen Mother.
            Teneniel Djo was born in to the Singing Mountain Clan of Dathomiri Witches to Allaya Djo, the clan's warleader. While Teneniel was still young, Allaya Djo died in battle, and Teneniel was raised by her grandmother Augwynne Djo, the clan's leader.[4]
            Augwynne taught Teneniel the basics of Allyan Magic, and eventually Teneniel became proficient in the use of an ability called the Spell of Storm. This ability would cause massive wind storms or slight breezes, depending on how it was used.[6]
            When Teneniel was around sixteen years of age, she caught two of her Initiate sisters using spells from the forbidden Book of Shadows. Enraged at her fellow Initiates for attempting to learn the Dark Spells, she cast the Spell of Storm on them. Although they survived, Teneniel was sentenced to four years of exile in the desert in an effort to atone for her rage.[6]
            Her exile was not a total banishment, as she was allowed back to visit the clan, but for no more than a week at a time. During her four years of exile, she was drawn to the crash site of the Chu'unthor, and tried many times by many different means to break inside the ancient shipwreck. After a vision revealed that she would find a husband at the crash site, she took shelter nearby and waited.[6]
            In 8 ABY, while tending to the garden she was growing a short distance away, Teneniel sensed a disturbance near the Chu'unthor. When she went to check it out, she happened upon Luke Skywalker and Prince Isolder of Hapes, who had come to Dathomir to search for Han Solo and Leia Organa. She duly captured both men as potential husbands, and although she considered Isolder more attractive, she was drawn to the fact that Luke, a "simple male," could cast spells without using words and considered him a prize catch. After the two men explained their plight to Teneniel, she agreed to take them to see her grandmother at the Singing Mountain village.[4]
            Along the journey to her village she and Luke were attacked by the Nightsister Ocheron. Teneniel was nearly killed in the encounter by Ocheron's Force lightning, though she was saved when Luke decapitated Ocheron and healed her wounds. Since Luke had saved Teneniel's life, she no longer had a claim to him as her husband per Dathomiri tradition.[4]
            After returning to Singing Mountain clan village with Isolder and Luke, she was greeted by her grandmother Augwynne. After introducing Luke and Isolder to the clan, Teneniel claimed Isolder as her husband in front of the whole clan village, stunning him. Leia Organa (who along with Han Solo was a guest of the clan villagers) offered to buy him from Teneniel, but Teneniel stated that he wasn't for sale yet. Shortly afterward, because the other clan sisters would claim him if she set him free outright, Teneniel gave Isolder his freedom in all but name.[4]
            Han's ship the Millennium Falcon was a working ship that the Nightsisters coveted, and they planned to use it in their plot to escape the confines of Dathomir. To prevent them from doing so, the group of Isolder, Teneniel, Leia, Han, Chewbacca and Luke sought out Barukka, a former Nightsister and Teneniel's aunt, to get information of how to sneak into the Nightsister-controlled Imperial prison to locate spare parts with which to repair the ship and leave Dathomir. After getting the information from the half-insane former Nightsister, the group then infiltrated the Imperial prison.[4]
            After locating a suitable ship from which to steal parts, the group was attacked by Nightsisters, and Teneniel was almost killed by Baritha. After being saved by Luke, Teneniel gave into her anger towards Gethzerion and the Nightsisters and unleashed the Spell of Storm. Luke stopped her before she could kill the Nightsisters, and the group escaped the prison.[4]
            The Battle of Dathomir had begun when the group returned to the Singing Mountain clan village. During the battle, Teneniel had again used the Spell of Storm, but this time she succeeded in killing her opponents. As a side effect of unleashing her power in anger, she had acquired a burst blood vessel on her face characteristic of a Nightsister. In an effort to atone for her rage, Teneniel gave part of her life force to a badly wounded Nightsister.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Teneniel_Djo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTenenielDjo</string></dict>
        <key>Bhindi Drayson</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.409.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bhindi Drayson was a Human female and daughter of New Republic Admiral Hiram Drayson. She served with Wraith Squadron as a tactics expert during the Yuuzhan Vong War, and was with the Wraiths on Borleias after the Battle of Coruscant. As part of the defense of Borleias, Drayson participated in several efforts to keep the Yuuzhan Vong at bay.
            Her stay on Borleias was cut short when she and several other Wraiths were assigned to an infiltration mission to the fallen galactic capital of Coruscant, along with three Jedi. In the original mission plan, Drayson was to remain on Coruscant until the New Republic returned to take the world; her skills would be put to use aiding survivors and transmitting intelligence to the New Republic. After seeing the situation on the ground, however, Wraith Leader Garik Loran decided that leaving Drayson behind would be pointless. Following the completion of their mission with the Jedi defeating the renegade Dark Jedi Irek Ismaren, Drayson instead returned with the rest of party to Borleias, except for Wraith biologist Baljos Arnjak, who decided to remain on Coruscant. Drayson would later serve as part of the briefing team in preparation for the final stages of the Yuuzhan Vong War.
            In 44 ABY, after the Wraiths were disbanded during the Daala administration, Drayson was recruited by her former leader Loran to reform Wraith Squadron. She recruited and led a team of operatives tasked with investigating Galactic Alliance General Stavin Thaal, who was suspected of conspiring against the government. She and her team were able to gather evidence that implicated Thaal, but stumbled across another Wraith Squadron team. The two teams were discovered and pursued by forces loyal to Thaal. In an attempt to delay the pursuit, Drayson and another Wraith, Huhunna, split off and opened fire on their attackers. During the firefight, Drayson was mortally wounded. Her last orders were to not surrender to save her life and Voort saBinring took over the now combined units after her death.
            Bhindi Drayson was the daughter of Admiral Hiram Drayson, a high-ranking New Republic Intelligence director, who long-operated the Alpha Blue agency. In her adult life, Bhindi Drayson eventually followed in her father's footsteps and entered a career in New Republic Intelligence.[5]
            During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Drayson was part of the NRI unit Wraith Squadron, specializing in tactics and analysis of Yuuzhan Vong strategems. In 27 ABY, after the galactic capital of Coruscant fell to the Yuuzhan Vong invaders, Drayson and the rest of their Wraiths made their way to the newly secured garrison on the planet Borleias, which was commanded by New Republic General Wedge Antilles. While on Borleias serving in its defense, part of the Wraiths' duties included analyzing a recording for scientist Danni Quee, which later helped expose a civilian named Tam Elgrin as a Yuuzhan Vong agent.[2]
            When Jedi Master Luke Skywalker assembled an expedition to infiltrate Coruscant, Drayson was assigned to it, along with several other members of the Wraiths. The initial plan for the intelligence-gathering part of the mission was for Drayson to remain behind on Coruscant after the rest of the group—which also included Quee and the Jedi Mara Jade Skywalker and Tahiri Veila—departed. After she was left behind, Drayson's objective was to help organize resistance movements among the Coruscanti survivors to combat the Yuuzhan Vong, as well as continued passing of information to the New Republic to assist in the eventual recapture of the capital. One type of equipment that Drayson brought on the mission was a series of surveillance droids disguised as fungi to unobtrusively wander Coruscant while collecting and transmitting data. Drayson claimed that such information would be vital for future military engagements on Coruscant. Preliminary reports from Coruscant suggested that the Yuuzhan Vong had destroyed much of the city and were releasing worldshaping toxins into the atmosphere, so the New Republic wanted to learned more information about the alterations.[2]
            The Wraiths, three Jedi, and Quee were transported to Coruscant by former general Lando Calrissian in the freighter Record Time. Once in orbit, they were jettisoned from the ship, and descended in pods disguised as debris and the remnants of Yuuzhan Vong coralskippers. The expeditionary force landed safely on Coruscant without being detected by the Yuuzhan Vong.[2]
            Some time after landing, the expedition team was exploring the ruined cityscape when they came across a party of Yuuzhan Vong warriors near a walkway connecting two buildings. Due to the fake vonduun crab armor that the group was wearing, they were mistaken for Yuuzhan Vong warriors by the other party. However, after the other warriors demanded they yield the right-of-way, an insult that no true warrior would tolerate, a firefight ensued. Drayson remained in the rear, firing her blaster in support of the Jedi, who bore the brunt of the skirmish. After fellow Wraith Kell Tainer destroyed the walkway with a bomb, the rest of the warriors were slain by the Jedi, and the team left the area, thankful that they had escaped unharmed and with their disguises intact.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bhindi_Drayson</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBhindiDrayson</string></dict>

        <key>Ur-Sema Du</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.411.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ur-Sema Du was a female Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order in the waning years of the Galactic Republic.
            Ur-Sema Du was a Force-sensitive Human who received training in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Master after constructing a green-bladed lightsaber.
            When the Separatist Crisis between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems erupted into a conflict on Geonosis, Master Du answered Master of the Order Mace Windu's call-to-arms by flying to the dust-covered world. As part of Windu's strike team assembled to rescue Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala from execution by the Confederacy leaders, Du landed on the plains of Geonosis outside the Petranaki arena. While her comrades attacked the arena from the grandstands, Master Du delved deep into the catacombs. Amidst the damp quiet of the insect-constructed facility, was the first Jedi to encounter the monstrous General Grievous, a Kaleesh cyborg who was poised to lead the Separatist Droid Army in the coming Clone Wars. Wielding her lightsaber against Grievous' electrostaff, Du fought valiantly but was overpowered and killed by the General. Collecting her lightsaber as a trophy, Grievous left her body where it laid, his existence remaining a secret from the Republic until he was ready to unleash his full might on the Grand Army of the Republic.[1]
            This Jedi was the creation of artist Joe Corroney, who modeled her after fellow artist Jan Duursema, from whom the character also takes her name. The name originally appeared only on Corroney's website, and was thus not part of the canon. This changed after the mention in Unknown Soldier: The Story of General Grievous, which made the name canonical.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ur-Sema_Du</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemUrSemaDu</string></dict>

            While on Coruscant with Padmé Amidala in the leadup to voting on the Military Creation Act, Dormé noticed the growing affection between the Senator and the Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker as she watched from the sidelines.[1]
            When Senator Amidala was forced to flee the Galactic Republic capital with Skywalker and R2-D2, Dormé remained behind, along with Captain Gregar Typho, in order to maintain the illusion that Padmé was still on the planet and thus throw off further assassination attempts.[2]

            Dormé was portrayed by Australian actress Rose Byrne in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.[2] Though not actually visible in the film, Dormé was scripted to have quietly laughed during Anakin Skywalker's outburst of frustration while Padmé Amidala packed to depart from Coruscant.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dorm%C3%A9/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDorme</string></dict>

        <key>Torra Doza</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.416.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Torra Doza was a human female pilot who lived on the Colossus, an aircraft refueling station located on the Outer Rim world of Castilon, during the era of the New Republic. The daughter of a former pilot for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, her mother's exploits helped inspire Doza's own love of flying. She was a resident of the facility's upper levels, owing to the position of her father, Captain Imanuel Doza, as station operator.
            Doza piloted the Blue Ace, a state-of-the-art ship with various customizations suited to her personality and racing skills, during the time of the cold war. Her membership in Ace Squadron—a starfighter squadron employed by the station for defense purposes—afforded Doza the opportunity to fly alongside some of the most skilled pilots in the galaxy. She was an avid racer who often participated in the station's racing contests. After his arrival in 34 ABY, Torra became acquainted with fellow racer Kazuda Xiono, secretly a Resistance spy, and eventually came to suspect there was more to Xiono than he claimed.
            Born in 19 ABY, Torra Doza was the daughter of Imanuel Doza[1] and a former pilot for the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[4] She grew up on the Colossus refuelling platform on the ocean planet Castilon, raised by her overprotective father.[1] At a young age, Doza joined the Ace Squadron—a team of highly skilled and competitive starship pilots hired to protect the Colossus. Serving as the youngest of the Aces,[2] Doza piloted the Blue Ace, an advanced starfighter that incorporated various design modifications and coloration to reflect her personality and flying skills.[5][2]
            Doza's affiliation with the Aces afforded her the opportunity to participate in the station's racing competitions. During the rise of the First Order, Doza became acquainted with Kazuda Xiono, a New Republic pilot who raced for Jarek Yeager's Team Fireball while also working as a spy for the Resistance. She met him when he chose her as his opponent in a solo race he had been unwillingly signed up for, and she came down to Team Fireball's repair shop to wish Xiono good luck. During the race, she and Xiono proved to be very close, if not superior, in skill, and the deciding factor was ultimately the quality of their ships, as the engines of the ramshackle Fireball gave out when Xiono pushed them too hard, causing them to crash and giving Doza the victory. After Xiono was rescued, Doza made sure to be there when he woke up, and congratulated him on surviving a race against her, which she had earlier claimed had never happened before.[2]
            A short time later, when Kragan Gorr and his gang of pirates attacked the Colossus during a major storm, Doza, along with fellow Aces Freya Fenris, Hype Fazon and Bo Keevil, defended the platform in their starships. They fought well, but were outnumbered until the pirates abruptly retreated. While Fenris believed the Aces' skill has been sufficient to claim a victory, Doza suspected there was another factor that they didn't know about. She was correct — Xiono had assisted by broadcasting a grating feedback loop over the pirates' communications channel.[6]
            Torra's next encounter with Xiono came when he managed to get himself invited into Doza Tower by Hype Fazon in an attempt to find out what visiting First Order personnel were doing on the platform. After being discovered outside Captain Doza's office, Xiono fled. Hearing the commotion, Torra sent a droid, 4D-M1N, outside to see what was going on, and Xiono slipped into the open door of her bedroom without knowing what room he was entering. Torra, assuming Xiono had come because he was attracted to her, turned him down.[7]
            She was more concerned with what her father, Captain Doza, would do to Xiono if he found him there, and helped him out her window to the narrow ledge below it before the stormtroopers pursuing him forced their way in. Torra tried to claim that Xiono had gone in a different direction, but it didn't work, and the troopers left. After Xiono had successfully escaped his pursuers, when Major Elrik Vonreg confronted Captain Doza about the spy on the platform, Torra claimed that the intruder, Xiono, had merely been a friend of hers who had gotten lost while on his way out of the tower. Doza backed her up, and eventually Vonreg and his troops left.[7]
            Torra was sent, along with the rest of the Aces, to escort in an important shipment, resulting in a pirate attack on the platform thanks to the pirates' spy, Synara San.[8] Later, Torra competed, along with the rest of the Aces, in the annual Platform Classic, placing third after Jarek Yeager chose at the last second to let his brother, Marcus Speedstar, win as he was in need of the prize money.[9]
            Torra, due to her father's over-protectiveness, was not often allowed to go out, but she grew bored of doing nothing but playing flight simulator games and being alone all day. Sometime after the Platform Classic of 34 ABY, she attempted to ask her father if they could go on a hover cruise, on the same day he was awaiting the arrival of Commander Pyre of the First Order. Doza promised Torra they could go on the cruise in three and a half hours, and had 4D-M1N lock her in her room for her own safety. Torra first had the droid take out her pet Voorpak, Buggles, on the premise that the animal might have an accident indoors, and then snuck out, having deduced the passcode.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Torra_Doza</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTorraDoza</string></dict>

        <key>Dia</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.420.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dia was a Human female from Taris who served as a waitress at Javyar's Cantina during the Jedi Civil War.
            In 3956 BBY, Dia was working as a waitress at Javyar's Cantina in the Lower City. One day, she caught the attention of a man named Holdan, a henchman for the local crime syndicate, the Exchange. When the drunk man attempted to force himself upon her, Dia defended herself with a vibroblade, scarring him. The incident infuriated Holdan as it humiliated him in front of his friends. His wrath materialized itself in a bounty on Dia's head worth 300 credits, and the woman was reduced to hiding in an Upper City apartment amongst illegal aliens. Because of Holdan's connections to Davik Kang, crime lord of the Exchange, the local authorities turned a blind eye to her plight. Too afraid for her life to leave the apartment, Dia soon lost touch with the political affairs of the outside world.[1]
            By chance, Dia met the Galactic Republic soldier Revan, who was hiding out in the apartment next-door. Meeting him turned out to be a twist of fate for her. The former Sith Lord was able to convince Holdan to withdraw the bounty he had placed on Dia's head. When Revan returned to Dia to deliver the good news, the grateful waitress offered her family heirloom, an energy projector for a vibroblade, as a reward but Revan refused, telling her that to help her was thanks enough. She was able to return to her normal life just before the Sith Empire bombarded the planet.[1][2]
            When Dia received a bounty on her head, she thought that the most sensible course was to hide away at her apartment indefinitely, refusing to risk even leaving the complex. Though this was motivated by fear, when attacked or faced with unavoidable danger, she believed in—and was capable of—making a brave stand to prove she was not as defenseless as she seemed. She could be defiant and did not shy away from criticizing the misdeeds of others, such as burglary or harassment.[1]
            Dia appears as a non-player character in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. She is found at the apartment right next-door that of the player on Taris.[1]
            There are three ways to convince Holdan to drop the bounty and receive light side points: the player can pay him two hundred credits to cancel the bounty, persuade him to cancel without paying, or, if Bastila Shan is in the party, she will use Force persuasion to have him withdraw the bounty should the player fail to convince Holdan him/herself.[1]
            If the player has Dia's bounty removed, she will offer the player an energy projector upgrade for a vibroblade, telling the player it is a family heirloom. The player can either accept it or either refuse and obtain even more light side points.[1]
            Alternatively in the dark side option, the player can kill Dia and talk to Holdan to claim the bounty. If Carth Onasi is in the party, he objects to the act in which the player can either rethink his/her course of action or proceed with his/her attack anyways. In spite of Carth's disapproval, he will still aid the player in killing Dia due to the particular gameplay mechanics. When the player collects the bounty from Zax, he/she can attempt to persuade the Hutt to raise the reward from 300 to 400 credits, but if this fails and the player insists on pressuring Zax, he/she will be dismissed empty-headed.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dia</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDia</string></dict>

To protect herself, Mother Dean employed two Barabel bodyguards to ensure her safety at all times.[3]

        <key>Lorana Jinzler</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.426.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lorana Jinzler was a female Human Jedi Knight of the Jedi Order and served as a former Padawan of Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth. She had dark hair, gray eyes, and was of medium height.
            Lorana's parents were both employees at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. When she was born and taken in by the Jedi Order, her parents were dismissed in accordance with the Jedi Code regarding emotional attachments and relationships. Her parents kept track of her progressive Jedi training from a friend who still worked at the Temple. The third of four Jinzler children, Lorana was accepted for Jedi training at the age of 10 months, and was taken to the Temple, only meeting her jealous, hurt brother Dean at the initiation of Outbound Flight.[1]
            Often surprised by her master's gruff tone and high expectations, Jorus C'baoth and Lorana weren't as close as other Padawans and their Jedi Masters. Lorana was often unsure of the Jedi's role, unlike her master, who believed Jedi had the power and inherent role to rule others who were not Force-sensitive, and watch over them.
            Shortly before she became a Jedi Knight, Lorana and C'baoth were sent on a mission to the planet of Barlok. They met with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan, Anakin Skywalker. C'baoth sent them away while he attended a meeting. Later, Lorana was captured by terrorists, but was rescued by Kenobi and Skywalker. The next day she attempted to stop the missile that was sent to destroy the negotiators, but failed. Her master, however, destroyed it.
            At age 22, Lorana was promoted to the level of Jedi Knight shortly before the launch of the Outbound Flight, although this was due to the fact Master Jorus C'boath wanted her to come with him on the Outbound Flight.
            Lorana was selected for the Outbound Flight exploration mission by her master. She was far more reasonable and humble than C'baoth, and during the initial stages of the flight, she could usually be found trying to appease the disgruntled passengers.
            When Outbound Flight was attacked in warning by Commander Thrawn, many lives unintentionally perished and Lorana felt C'baoth's fall to the dark side. She tried to reach her former master in time to help him but she sensed his death by the second wave of assault droids. When the outer ships were mostly destroyed by Kinman Doriana, the only survivors were Lorana and the fifty-seven passengers C'baoth had imprisoned in the central storage core.
            While attempting to save the ship, Lorana met Syndic Thrass, who was Thrawn's brother, and Jorj Car'das on the bridge of D-One. She and Thrass had planned to land the ship on a planetoid in The Redoubt, with D-Three on the top, allowing them to use the small ship there to get aid. But the surviving passengers had moved to D-Four. With no other choice but to land D-1 on the bottom to save the colonists, Lorana and Thrass chose to sacrifice their lives for the survivors in D-Four.
            Nearly fifty years after her death, her brother traveled to the wreckage of Outbound Flight with the Jedi Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker when it was rediscovered by the Chiss. Her skeletal remains were found next to Mitth'ras'safis's remains in one of the cockpits of the Outbound Flight Project.
            Lorana Jinzler was also remembered by one of the Survivors of Outbound Flight, Jorad Pressor, who had known her as Jedi Lorana back when he was a child. It was for this reason that Dean Jinzler was released from a trap that was set by the Survivors to try resolving the problem diplomatically.
            Lorana wielded a green lightsaber, with an amethyst gem in the place of the activation stud (this gem had, unbeknownst to Lorana, been a gift from her parents). This lightsaber was recovered by Luke Skywalker, but was later destroyed.
            Lorana was humble and good-natured. However, she lacked self-confidence, something which was not helped by working with Jorus C'baoth, who was very sure of himself, and expected any Padawan of his to feel the same.

            In the last decades of the Galactic Republic, Jira lived on the desert planet of Tatooine, in the Outer Rim Territories. At the time of the Naboo Crisis, she ran a small stand in the market place of Mos Espa, where she sold various food products, including pallies. Jira was a friend to Anakin Skywalker, then a nine-year-old slave boy. When the elderly woman expressed her need for a cooling unit, Skywalker offered to search for one on her behalf.[2] When her young friend Skywalker met the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Jira sold them a few pallies. Feeling in her old bones that a sandstorm was about to occur, she advised Skywalker to get home as soon as possible. A few days later, Jira's young friend left Tatooine with Qui-Gon Jinn.[3]
            Jira was a green-eyed[3] human female.[1] In her old age, she tied up her gray hair into loose braids.[3] Despite her poverty, Jira was still a jovial woman.

            In 4 ABY, Jess worked as a musician in Jabba's Palace, hoping to eventually leave the establishment by joining a band. Jess was often seen in the company of Bib Fortuna[2] stroking his lekku. He reciprocated the gesture, often leading her around the throne room by hand. Though he still reminded her what she was, dragging her to the sight of the dancing girl Oola when being fed to the rancor. Later, she was left to slumber alone on Jabba's dais with Yarna, and some random patron as Fortuna lay in wait with his master, ready to spring the trap as Leia Organa, disguised as Boushh, released Han Solo from carbonite.[1] Whether she went on Jabba's sailbarge with the others is unknown.

            Born on Bonadan, Gi was glad to escape offworld and join the New Jedi Order, training alongside Yabeley and Bey Gandan, both of whom developed attractions to her. Along with Gandan, she was presumed killed in the Battle of Gyndine, though in reality they survived, finding a qahsa filled with information on a Yuuzhan Vong plot to create anti-Jedi weapons and destroy the bacta on Thyferra.
            Jedi Master Luke Skywalker hired Uldir Lochett and the crew of the No Luck Required to recover Gi, but she discovered the plot and escaped, fleeing to Wayland. Investigating Yuuzhan Vong activity there, she was captured along with her two male companions, and they were tortured, with Yabeley dying. Lochett tracked her and helped free the other Jedi from Chom-Vrone, and were able to flee off world. However, they discovered too late that Gandan had been injected with a poison that, when released, would kill the bacta-producing alazhi trees. After a long battle, Gi and Lochett killed Gandan and destroyed the virus.
            She was one of the survivors of the war that was called to a meeting of the New Jedi Order on Zonama Sekot by Grand Master Skywalker.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Klin-Fa_Gi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKlinFaGi</string></dict>

        <key>Jenn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.433.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jenn was a Human female starfighter pilot who served as a commander in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. She was killed during a routine patrol of the Dreighton Triangle when one of the Galactic Empire's new TIE Phantom starfighters used its cloaking device to take her by surprise, damaging her X-wing and causing her to collide with Ensign Till's fighter.
            The Human female Jenn was born around 25 BBY, during the final years of the Galactic Republic.[1] At some point before 3 ABY,[2] Jenn joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic as a starfighter pilot[3] and rose to the rank of commander.[4]
            Following the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY,[2] the Galactic Empire entered the final stages of development for the TIE Phantom, a new starfighter which was fitted with a cloaking device that rendered it invisible to other vessels. As the project neared completion, the Empire began a series of tests in the region of space known as the Dreighton Triangle, using reports of unexplained events in the region ever since the Battle of Dreighton during the Clone Wars as a cover for their operations. Around this time, Jenn was tasked to lead a flight group of three T-65 X-wing starfighters, including one flown by Ensign Till, on a patrol mission around the Dreighton Nebula. At first the group's sensors failed to detect any signs of activity but Jenn ordered one more pass before returning to base. Moments later, a TIE Phantom decloaked behind her X-wing and opened fire, tearing the starboard S-foils from the fuselage and disabling her stabilizer. Unable to control her fighter, Jenn drifted to port and collided with Till's X-wing, destroying both fighters and killing both pilots.[3]
            Jenn was a professional officer who was brave, intelligent, and who possessed a good sense of humor. She was good friends with Till and frequently teased the other pilot.[4] On one such occasion, Jenn mocked Till's apparent fear of the ghost ship stories regarding the Dreighton Triangle.[3]
            Jenn was created for the 1995 LucasArts video game Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire, in which she appears during the opening cutscene. The character was portrayed in the game by actress Zachary Barton.[3]
            Rebel Assault II designer Vincent Lee's storyboards and scripts document, dated November 16, 1994, included a brief description of Jenn.[5] Though not included in the game or its manual,[3] the biography was adapted for use on the LucasArts website[4] and the document was later printed in Rob Smith's Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts.[5] The version that appeared online places Jenn in her late twenties during the game[4] whereas Lee's original version described her as "late twenties to early thirties." Lee also made notes on the people he thought symbolized each character in the game, choosing actress Holly Hunter to represent Jenn. An early storyboard of the scene in which Jenn appears reveals that her flight group was originally called "Gamma patrol,"[5] but the group was unnamed in the final game.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jenn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJenn</string></dict>

She worked as a thief for the gang and fought using a self-invented style of martial arts that made use of her balance and coordination. In 13 BBY, she was present when the scrumrat Han escaped from Proxima in the Den of the White Worms.
            Jagleo was human female from the planet Corellia who worked as a dancer before becoming a scrumrat and a thief in the White Worms gang of Coronet City.[1] In the year 13 BBY,[3] Jagleo was present in the den when fellow scrumrat Han was brought before Lady Proxima, leader of the gang. Han, who had returned from a trade with no goods for Proxima, used a rock to break a shutter behind the gang leader and bathe her in light, which burned her skin. Using the distraction, Han then pushed through the other scrumrats and escaped.[2]
            Jagleo adapted her balance and coordination into a self-invented form of martial arts which she used to defend herself. She was a nimble thief and could shimmy into tight spaces.[1] She had fair skin, blonde hair, and green eyes.[2]
            Jagleo wore a gray brine-stained tunic, wristwraps, and cap with a gray light-filter headband. She used a pipe as a makeshift weapon.[1]

        <key>Mara Jade Skywalker</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.437.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mara Jade Skywalker was, during different times in her life, an Emperor's Hand, a smuggler, and later a Jedi Master who sat upon the Jedi High Council. She was raised as a servant and assassin to Emperor Palpatine and became a high-level Force-using operative. As an Emperor's Hand, Jade carried out the Emperor's bidding, killing Rebels and corrupt Imperials alike with cold professionalism, even as a young woman. As Palpatine's assassin, she received top-notch training from experts in a variety of fields as well as training in the Force, which was continued by Luke Skywalker years later. After Palpatine's death, she received his last command, which was to kill Luke Skywalker; however, the death of her Master caused her to go rogue. Eventually she joined smuggler chief Talon Karrde, becoming one of his best smugglers and his second-in-command. During the predations of Grand Admiral Thrawn, she was forced to work with Skywalker, and developed a grudging respect for him. During the Galactic Civil War, Mara Jade proved herself skilled in a variety of fields; she was a good pilot and mechanic and trained in the use of both a blaster and hand-to-hand combat even without relying on the Force.
            Over the years, she continued to work for Karrde and interact with Skywalker intermittently, training at his Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 for a short period of time. She was groomed by Karrde to take over the Smugglers' Alliance and had a brief relationship with Lando Calrissian as part of that role, although she later admitted it was a charade. She also continued to grow closer to Skywalker and worked alongside him on numerous occasions, including the Almanian Uprising and the Corellian Crisis. The two finally realized in 19 ABY while on a mission to Nirauan that they were in love, and wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.
            After marrying Skywalker, Mara Jade took the surname Skywalker and devoted her life to the New Jedi Order, becoming a Master in her own right. Shortly before the Yuuzhan Vong War, she fell ill due to deadly coomb spores that she'd been infected with by a Yuuzhan Vong agent. She used the Force to slow their progress even as she continued to fight against the alien invaders on numerous battlefields including Dantooine and Ithor, but the disease was only purged from her system after the birth of her son Ben in 26 ABY. After becoming a Master, Jade Skywalker took her niece Jaina Solo as an apprentice until she reached Knighthood. During that time, she participated in Jedi offensives against the Yuuzhan Vong, aiding in the war effort. After the fall of Coruscant, she helped Cal Omas become elected as the Chief of State as the New Republic reorganized itself into the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. Jade Skywalker ultimately saw her efforts against the Yuuzhan Vong rewarded in the war's final battle on Coruscant with the death of Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane.
            In the following years, Jade Skywalker was active during the Dark Nest Crisis and the subsequent Swarm War, wherein she helped to thwart the expansionist plans of Raynar Thul and the insectoid Killiks who were spreading into Chiss space and subverting many other people into becoming Joiners under the influence of several Dark Jedi. Jade Skywalker was insistent that the Jedi who had joined Killik communities would be withdrawn, as they were using their skills in combat against the Chiss, provoking them. She continued to serve by the side of her husband as a Jedi Master during the Second Galactic Civil War, first serving alongside the Galactic Alliance against the rebellious Confederation. The re-emergence of the Sith Lady Lumiya was another threat that Jade Skywalker had to confront, but though she and her husband skirmished with both Lumiya and the fallen Jedi Alema Rar on multiple occasions, the darksiders escaped. As the war escalated, Jade Skywalker was killed by her nephew, Jacen Solo, whom she had learned was a Sith and therefore saw as a threat to her family personally, to the Jedi Order, and to the galaxy at large.
            Mara Jade was born in 17 BBY[1] during a time of great instability as Emperor Palpatine, alias the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, and his apprentice Darth Vader were eliminating the remnants of the Jedi Order. The Emperor took Jade from her parents and brought her to the planet Coruscant at a very young age, where he began to train her in the Force, although officially she was one of the Imperial Palace's dancers. Years later, Jade remembered little about her early life besides her parents' reluctance to let her go and her own certainty that she was going to leave with the Emperor.[8] She did recall at one point that she had had a falling-star globe as a child and had gotten in trouble after breaking it to see how it worked.[10] Her master trained her in the ways of the Force and she was made into an agent of the Empire.[8] Some of the Imperial court assumed her to simply be a dancer or one of Palpatine's concubines.[6]
            Throughout Jade's youth, she was pushed through an intensive training regimen—which involved training alongside the Imperial Royal Guard[11] and learning covert espionage and assassination skills, at which she was adept by the age of fourteen[2]—and became an "Emperor's Hand," one of Palpatine's personal assassins,[12] after a final test in which she successfully broke into Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's private quarters.[6] In order to accomplish her mission, Jade, posing as a guest at a formal event at Tarkin's residence, feigned illness in order to get away from the other guests. She then retrieved a sack of equipment and descended down the side of the building to the room containing Tarkin's private safe. While she was breaking in, a group of guards came in—actually droids—and she engaged them with her blaster and lightsaber. However, upon sensing that one of the guards was living, she knocked him out rather than kill a soldier willing to give his life in a training exercise. Vader and Sidious were pleased with her skills and she was pronounced the Emperor's Hand.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mara_Jade_Skywalker</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMaraJadeSkywalker</string></dict>
        <key>Jamillia</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.438.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jamillia was a Human female who served as the successor of Queen Amidala, formally styled as Her Royal Highness, Queen Jamillia of Naboo. Jamillia, like her predecessor, was a young woman when elected (though not as young as Padmé Amidala was during her first term), with a regal and dignified bearing.
            A female of the Human species, Jamillia came from the southeastern regions of Naboo,[1] a peaceful planet located in the Chommell sector of the galaxy.[5] Jamillia's predecessor, after serving two successful four-year terms as Queen, was popular enough that many of the Naboo wanted to amend their constitution to allow Amidala to serve a third term. However, she graciously declined the honor, and Jamillia became Naboo's next elected monarch. The new Queen asked her still-popular predecessor to continue her career in public service by becoming Naboo's Senator, even though Amidala had reached the normal age for the Naboo to retire from politics and was well within her rights to do so. Padmé agreed and became Naboo's representative in the Galactic Senate.[3]
            The membership of the Royal Advisory Council under Queen Jamillia was apparently different from the membership under Amidala, with the exception of Sio Bibble and Graf Zapalo.[3]
            During the Separatist Crisis, Jamillia was one of many planetary rulers who opened up their worlds to aid many refugees who were fleeing the planets seceding from the Galactic Republic.[6] For this she received much criticism, particularly from unions representing Naboo spice miners, such as the Naboo Moon Mining Union, whose main ports became a part of the refugee movement on Naboo.[4]
            In 22 BBY, after surviving a Separatist-backed assassination attempt, Amidala left Coruscant for the safety of Naboo. Jamillia was very worried about the Senator and helped conceal her presence.[3] Before Amidala left for the Lake Country, Jamillia suggested to her that she make contact with her family, who had also grown very concerned for her safety.[7] Just after the start of the Clone Wars, during the run-up to the Battle of Ohma-D'un, Jamillia appointed Amidala's protocol droid, C-3PO, as Naboo's ambassador to the Jedi Order.[8]
            In 21 BBY, Jamillia asked Amidala to mediate a dispute between Naboo's Artisans' Guild and the Bonadan Silver Sand Consortium. The Queen also offered refugee status to the people of Torbel, a village on the planet Lanteeb that had been occupied by the Separatists, led by General Lok Durd, and destroyed during a Republic assault.[9]
            Shortly afterwards, Jamillia was replaced by Queen Neeyutnee.[10]
            A Human female from Naboo, Jamillia was relatively small, measuring only 1.57 meters[2] She had a round face with a rather large mouth, a narrow chin and pronounced cheeks. Both her hair and eye color were dark brown.[3] According to Senator Amidala, Queen Jamillia looked aptly regal, just "every bit the part of Queen". She had a rich,[7] perfectly regal voice,[1] with a southeastern accent that made her enunciate the consonants powerfully. As she despised small talk, Jamillia would often get to the point of the question very quickly, which made her sound blunt at times.[7]
            The Queen preferred to focus on Naboo's internal politics, leaving the conduction of foreign affairs to Senator Padmé Amidala.[11]
            Jamillia was portrayed by Indian actress Ayesha Dharker in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, the second installment in the Star Wars prequel trilogy.
            Dharker spent a month in Australia, a week-and-a-half in Lake Como and then a few days in Caserta, Italy for only half-a-day of shooting.[12]
            In Attack of the Clones: The Visual Dictionary and some of the early scripts of Attack of the Clones, the transliteration "Jamilla" was used instead.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jamillia/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemJamillia</string></dict>

        <key>Peet Deretalia</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.440.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Peet Deretalia was a human female who worked as a technician for the Resistance ground crew. During Deretalia's service, she became affectionate toward X-wing pilot Theo Meltsa, but she was too timid to introduce herself. Around 34 ABY, the astromech droid BB-8 enacted a scheme that introduced Deretalia to Meltsa, and the two humans immediately bonded. Deretalia thanked BB-8 with an extra oil bath, and she sent a commendation of the droid to Commander Poe Dameron.
            A human female, Peet Deretalia was a technician who served in the Resistance[1] against the First Order.[2] Working for the ground crew at the Resistance base on D'Qar, Deretalia serviced and maintained[1] T-70 X-wing starfighters and Resistance droids.[2] During her time as a technician, Deretalia fell in love with Resistance pilot Theo Meltsa. Likewise, Meltsa had feelings for Deretalia, but they were both too shy to introduce themselves.[1]
            Less than a year before the First Order's attack on Tuanul in 34 ABY,[3] the astromech droid BB-8 took notice of Deretalia and Meltsa's mutual feelings, so the droid formed a plan to introduce them. BB-8 sabotaged Meltsa's X-wing starfighter and approached Deretalia, halting her work by repeatedly bumping into her. Deretalia quickly grew irritated of BB-8's antics and told the droid to stop, but the droid continued, knocking her off balance and causing her to fall into Meltsa.[1]
            Deretalia and Meltsa immediately bonded, and the pilot introduced himself, asking Deretalia if she could repair his ship. Deretalia cheerfully obliged, and she invited Meltsa to get a meal, stating that she knew the chef in the mess hall. Meltsa accepted her offer, and before the two left, Deretalia thanked BB-8 with a kiss. Hand-in-hand, Deretalia and Meltsa departed for the mess hall.[1]
            Later, Deretalia spoiled BB-8 with an extra oil bath, and she sent a note to Commander Poe Dameron, praising BB-8's wisdom. In the note, Deretalia also expressed concern for Meltsa's safety, and she requested that Dameron watch over him.[2]
            Deretalia had black hair, green eyes, and dark skin. She had affectionate feelings for Meltsa, but she was too bashful to introduce herself. When Deretalia's work was disrupted by BB-8, she was annoyed, but she became grateful once she understood the droid's plan.[1] Deretalia worried for Meltsa every time he entered his X-wing, and she voiced her concerns to Commander Dameron.[2]
            As a technician, Deretalia performed maintenance tasks on T-70 X-wing starfighters,[1] and she was also responsible for servicing Resistance droids.[2] When Meltsa's X-wing motivator was sabotaged by BB-8, Deretalia was easily able to repair the ship.[1]
            Deretalia wore brown gloves, black boots, and green overalls over a dark-green shirt. When working on Resistance starfighters, Deretalia carried a toolbox containing an assortment of devices.[1] As a technician for the Resistance's droid pool, Deretalia had access to oil baths.[2]
            Peet Deretalia first appeared in "SaBBotage," a comic strip created by Chris Eliopoulos and Jordie Bellaire. The story was first published in Poe Dameron 1: Black Squadron, Part I and released in 2016.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Peet_Deretalia</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemPeetDeretalia</string></dict>
        <key>Devi  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.441.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Devi was a human female scavenger on Jakku around 30 years after the Battle of Endor. She and her partner Strunk helped Rey scavenge for a long-buried 690 light freighter. The two then absconded with it to escape the planet after Rey piloted it to Niima Outpost.
            Born roughly a decade after the Battle of Endor, Devi spent most of her life scavenging on Jakku. She worked with Strunk, a scavenger known for his strength but not his intelligence. Both of them wanted to leave Jakku someday.[1]
            According to Devi, she and Strunk once saw a Nightwatcher worm in the Sinking Fields, one so large it could have eaten Niima Outpost in one bite. They told this to fellow scavanger Rey, but she did not believe them, partially because the duo had made other dubious claims in the past[3].
            Some time before the Battle of Starkiller Base, Devi noticed that Rey was holding back valuable salvage for herself and spending time repairing relatively worthless parts. Assuming that their fellow scavenger was building something and curious what, Devi and Strunk confronted Rey at the cleaning stations in Niima Outpost. When Rey declined to share her plans, Devi seemingly backed off, but warned Rey if she was noticing the strange behavior, others would notice too.[1]
            Devi and Strunk managed to trail Rey and discovered what the project was ten days later: Rey had found an almost completely intact Ghtroc 690 freighter. With the right parts, the ship would be able to fly again. Amazed at Rey's good fortune and aware of other useful parts, Devi and Strunk offered to help repair the Ghtroc in exchange for coming with when Rey used it to lave Jakku. When Rey explained that she was going to sell it to Unkar Plutt, Devi prevented Strunk from responding and brokered a deal. In exchange for helping repair the ship, she and Strunk would get half the profits from the sale (approx. five thousand shares, at least).[1]
            The new-business partners began fixing the Ghtroc, with Devi and Strunk being able to quickly supply parts that Rey could not have found on her own. As work progressed, Devi and Strunk began secretly camping out near the ship to guard their investment.[1]
            Two weeks later, when the Ghtroc was repaired enough to fly (but still missing a hyperdrive), Devi was a passenger on the test flight. Much to her exuberation, the ship worked. That night, while guarding the ship, Devi and Strunk found Rey, who had returned to the site, fending off Teedo interlopers. The two joined in the defense of it, driving the Teedos away. Devi admitted that she and Strunk had been secretly guarding the wreck for two weeks.[1]
            Devi also told Rey that she had she knew where to find a hyperdrive to complete the Ghtroc. Rey suggested that Devi guard the ship, while see and Strunk retrieve the hyperdrive. When Rey and Strunk returned with the drive the following evening, Rey had enough trust in Devi and Strunk to offer to let them sleep inside the Ghtroc, where it would be warmer.[1]
            Two days after collecting and installing the drive (and nearly a year after Rey had found the wreck in the first place), the trio flew their ship into Niima Outpost, making a show of it. Rey left Devi and Strunk onboard while she went off to sell the ship to Unkar. Once their partner was gone, Devi and Strunk stole the ship, using it to leave Jakku, the only reason they had helped in the first place, leaving Rey with nothing.[1]
            Some time later, Rey wrote about Devi in her journal, expressing her distrust for her fellow scavenger and calling her a "swindler" as well as alluding to the Ghtroc incident.[3]
            About Rey's age and built small, Devi kept her hair cut short. The smarter one between her and her partner, she acted as the leader. She brokered the decision to split Rey's salvage of the freighter, taking advantage of the situation to make a deal that Rey felt was unfair but could not see a safe way to decline.[1]
            Despite this, Devi presented a cheerful disposition during the salvage and managed to integrate herself with Rey to the extent of gaining her trust, all while planning to betray her. This was successful partially since Rey could not comprehend anyone wanting to leave Jakku and partially since Rey wanted to trust Devi.[1]
            Devi had a reputation for making unbelievable claims.[3] Her tendencies to talk a lot annoyed Rey.[1]
            In a fight, Devi was quick and, in Rey's estimation, more dangerous than Strunk. Devi carried a vibro-knife and a shortened shock stick. She also had a small blaster with an indeterminate number of shots.[1]
            Devi first appeared in the 2015 canon novel Before the Awakening, written by Greg Rucka as a prelude to Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Devi_(scavenger)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDevi</string></dict>
        <key>Dusque Mistflier</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.442.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dusque Mistflier was a Human female xenobiologist who was employed by the Imperial Corps of Bioengineers. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, she became embittered towards her employers and defected to the Rebel Alliance.
            Dusque Mistflier grew up on the world of Talus. She was the youngest of five children, and the only female. Her father was employed at a small firm manufacturing starship components, while her mother remained at home raising Dusque and her four brothers. When Dusque was a young girl, her father's employer began accepting contracts for the Galactic Empire. The simple line worker quickly grew disenfranchised with his work, notably when he discovered what his equipment was being used for. This resulted in numerous dinnertime arguments with his wife. Dusque would often sneak out of her room and eavesdrop on her parents during one of their many arguments. Before long however, Dusque's father suffered a convenient heart attack at work and died soon after. Dusque’s mother became completely despondent from his death and grew into a mere shell of the woman she once was.
            As Dusque grew older, she witnessed her brothers taking up her father's old position at the starship manufacturers. Her family's close connection with the Galactic Empire left a sour taste in her mouth, but she realized that life on Talus offered very little in the way of an alternative. One brother even enlisted in the Imperial Academy. His military career was short lived however, as he was killed during a training exercise shortly after joining up. With the death of the brother, Dusque’s mother’s condition worsened.
            Dusque eventually attended college and graduated with honors at the top of her class. She specialized in xenobiology and soon joined the Imperial Corps of Bioengineers. She left Talus forever and never looked back.
            As part of the ICB, Dusque traveled all across the galaxy, studying animal life from dozens of different planets. She developed her skills in the fields of hunting, trapping and exploration, and became one of the most accomplished scientists working for the Empire. Her superiors however, never gave Dusque her due recognition. She was consistently held back from advancement and lost several viable promotions to her fellow male colleagues.
            Dusque had a colleague and friend Tendau Nandon who was killed by the Empire, inspiring her to join the Rebel Alliance. Following Tendau's death, Dusque joined forces with Finn Darktrin, an undercover Imperial spy within the Rebel Alliance, on a mission to find a holocron containing the identities of Rebel sympathizers in order for it not to fall into Imperial hands. After obtaining the holocron on Dantooine, Dusque was betrayed and almost killed by Finn, had Luke Skywalker not saved her soon after Finn made his escape. Dusque survived the incident and continued on with the Rebel Alliance.
            Dusque Mistflier had long, waist-length brown hair and large gray eyes. During her time with the Imperial Corps of Bioengineers, she typically kept her hair tied back and wore simple, lab equipment fatigues. After defecting from the Empire, she began to wear more utilitarian clothing, including padded vests, hide-woven gloves and goggles.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dusque_Mistflier</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDusqueMistflier</string></dict>
        <key>Deltic</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.443.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Deltic, nicknamed Lieutenant Strangechild by her crewmate Commander Nibiru Chamas, was a human lieutenant in the Imperial Navy and the planetary science specialist of the Imperial Star Destroyer Ultimatum during its mission to the Gorse system in 11 BBY. She provided a report for the industrialist Count Denetrius Vidian and Captain Rae Sloane on the possibility of destroying the moon Cynda using explosives, causing Vidian to set in motion such a plan to more efficiently harvest the mineral thorilide.
            Deltic later accompanied Sloane and the Ultimatum to Calcoraan Depot to help collect the explosive Baradium-357 for use in destroying Cynda. However, a group of rebels led by Kanan Jarrus and Hera Syndulla ultimately foiled Vidian's plan to destroy the moon, and the count was revealed to be a traitor to the Empire. Nevertheless, Deltic greatly enjoyed working on the failed plan to destroy Cynda, joining a betting pool as to how much damage it would cause to the surface of the planet Gorse.
            The human female Lieutenant Deltic served in the Imperial Navy as the planetary science specialist aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Ultimatum during its mission to the Gorse system[1] in 11 BBY.[2] Commanded by Captain Rae Sloane, the ship and its crew were tasked with aiding industrialist Count Denetrius Vidian, who had been sent to the system to improve the efficiency of thorilide mining on Cynda, a moon of the planet Gorse. After demolitionist Skelly gave Vidian a report outlining the dangers of using explosives to mine on Cynda, Vidian had Deltic run projections based on Skelly's claims that too much explosive mining would destroy the moon.[1]
            Deltic found that Skelly had been partially correct, as Cynda could be destroyed by explosives, but such a blast would need a higher quality and greater quantity of explosives than Gorse had in all its supplies combined. She confirmed for the count that after the moon's fragmentation, large quantities of thorilide would remain in the system and so could be harvested, although she warned that some of the mineral would be ejected from the system entirely and some would end up on the surface of Gorse. Vidian was uninterested in the fate of those on Gorse's surface, but Sloane demanded to know what Deltic's findings predicted would happen. The lieutenant explained that parts of the moon would fall as meteors, with the amount depending on where Cynda was at in its lunar cycle when destroyed.[1]
            She then speculated that the meteors would cause catastrophic seismic activity on the planet and potentially cause it to start spinning again, since it was held stationary by Cynda's presence in its orbit. Deltic suggested that the destruction of Cynda might make no changes to Gorse at all or possibly destroy the planet's entire biome in the next ten years. Deltic also warned of the possibility that Cynda's destruction would cause the breakdown of large amounts of the thorilide located there, which would prevent them from harvesting it, and suggested that a test should be carried out to make sure the moon was not being destroyed for nothing.[1]
            Vidian elected to destroy Cynda based on Deltic's report. After a test proved that the thorilide would not break down following the moon's destruction, he ordered a fleet of mining vessels be sent from Gorse to his space station, Calcoraan Depot, where they were to collect the explosive isotope Baradium-357, which was strong enough to destroy Cynda in the quantities Vidian possessed. Aboard the Ultimatum, Deltic joined several other members of the Planetary Sciences department in a betting ring concerning how much damage the destruction of Cynda would cause on Gorse. She made a wager that the World Watch Plaza building would be destroyed by debris within a year of Cynda's fragmentation. When the Ultimatum also traveled to the Calcoraan system, where the depot was located, Sloane brought Deltic with her to the station to explain the process Vidian was carrying out, starting with how the vessel Forager functioned, as the count planned on using it to harvest the thorilide left in the Gorse system.[1]
            Vidian managed to get the explosives back to the Gorse system, but his plan to destroy Cynda was ultimately foiled by a group of rebels consisting of Skelly, the novice Jedi Kanan Jarrus, the pilot Hera Syndulla, and the Sullustan Zaluna Myder. Sloane and her crew ended up turning on Vidian when they discovered that he had planned to betray the Empire. For her role in Vidian's downfall, Sloane was honored at a ceremony on Gorse and awarded a permanent posting as captain of the Ultimatum. Deltic and other members of the Star Destroyer's crew attended the ceremony but were then sent back to the ship while Sloane attended a celebratory party.[1]
            Deltic was a fairly callous individual, caring little for the damage and suffering that Denetrius Vidian's plans for Cynda would cause among the population of Gorse. She was greatly excited by the report she put together for Vidian on the destruction of Cynda and grinned as she delivered it to him and Captain Rae Sloane, chuckling when revealing the damage that would be done to Gorse. When speculating on the amount of damage on the planet, Deltic postulated that it might be worth destroying the moon just to see what would happen, as she was unsure of the exact effects. She later suggested tests should be made to ensure that the thorilide would be harvestable after Cynda's destruction, otherwise Vidian's plan would lead to a "waste of a good moon."[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Deltic</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDeltic</string></dict>

        <key>Darth Zhorrid</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.447.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Zhorrid was a female Human who was the daughter and apprentice of Dark Councilor and Sith Lord Darth Jadus during the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. She later succeeded her father in becoming Councilor of the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence.
            Darth Zhorrid was the only known apprentice trained by her father, Darth Jadus.[1] She had scars running from the edges of her mouth to her ears. In her early years, she found herself being talented at singing, something that even her father acknowledged. Later, Jadus specifically hired a tutor to teach his daughter, who wasn't a Sith back in that time, how to sing. It was when the Sith lord set up an event in Kaas City for her only, that made overjoyed Zhorrid sang until she made all her subjects cry. Zhorrid sang her first and last opera for hours until she could sing no longer. It was then that Jadus chose to start her apprenticeship, as he know his daughter's love for him shall reduced to hatred for rest of her life.
            After her father's alleged murder at the hands of the terrorist known as the Eagle, she was named a member of the Dark Council to take his place. She later summoned Cipher Nine to her offices on Korriban, where she tested the agent's skills by ordering her guards to attack Nine. She then excused the Cipher to hunt down the terrorist cells.
            Though she demanded respect from her fellow Councilors, they simply laughed at her, viewing her as a child. She wished to seek revenge on Jadus' "killer," the Eagle, or all involved with him.
            Cipher Nine managed to eradicate those who were a part of the Eagle terrorist network, which gave Zhorrid a chance to achieve more personal power. In 3641 BBY the Star Cabal nearly brought Imperial Intelligence, one of the organizations operating inside her sphere of influence, to its knees. She disbanded the agency and, along with the Dark Council, established Sith Intelligence, which she headed directly though she was later replaced with Lana Beniko by Darth Marr.
            Darth Zhorrid wielded a single-bladed Sith lightsaber in combat. Zhorrid was also capable of Force lightning and Force storm.
            Darth Zhorrid was first indirectly mentioned in Darth Jadus's Holonet entry on the website for BioWare's video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. The entry contains several Aurebesh phrases; one of them is "Daughter is only known apprentice."[1]
            She would be killed if the Agent decided to ally with the secretly-alive Darth Jadus, otherwise it can be presumed that the Agent remained loyal to Zhorrid.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Zhorrid</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDarthZhorrid</string></dict>

            In 0 BBY, when a mission to transport the Hammertong prototype ended in a stormtrooper ambush, Karoly found herself on Tatooine, and she was in the Mos Eisley Cantina with her friend and comrade Shada D'ukal when Luke Skywalker first met Han Solo.
            As part of their attempt to hire a freighter to transport a stolen Hammertong module, the two Mistryl were masquerading as the Tonnika sisters: Karoly was disguised as Senni Tonnika while Shada posed as Brea Tonnika. Their choice of disguise got them briefly arrested by Colonel Parq before being freed by Rebel Alliance agent Riij Winward—although a subsequent disagreement on who should get the Hammertong information saw the Mistryl stealing his freighter to transport the superlaser component, while he made off with their astromech, D4, and a technical readout of the weapon.
            During the Hammertong mission, Shada had regarded Karoly as keen but somewhat inexperienced; by 19 ABY, however, Karoly had become a veteran warrior, and she was dispatched by the Eleven Elders of Emberlene to "recover" Shada on Borcorash as the Mistryl made steps to break their ties with Mazzic. Shada escaped, and Karoly's pursuit brought her to Bastion, where she allied herself with Major Grodin Tierce against her old enemy Captain Zothip of the Cavrilhu Pirates.
            Subsequently, Karoly agreed to bring Paloma D'asima to Yaga Minor, to discuss an alliance between the Mistryl and the Imperial Remnant; however, when the schemes of Moff Vilim Disra were exposed, and the false Grand Admiral Thrawn was revealed as the actor Flim, Karoly returned to Emberlene with her leader.
            Karoly was probably related to Team Prime Manda D'ulin, gunned down in the ambush at the Hammertong base, and also to an earlier Mistryl, Naradan D'ulin.
            Angela Staines portrayed Karoly D'ulin, disguised as Senni Tonnika, in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Karoly_D%27ulin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKarolyD'ulin</string></dict>

        <key>Anj Dahl</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.451.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Anj Dahl was a Human female that served the Galactic Alliance Remnant as a pilot during the Second Imperial Civil War. As a member of the Rogue Squadron, Dahl participated in the Battle of Mon Calamari. After the battle, Dahl was appointed to the position of Rogue Leader when Commander Jhoram Bey was elevated to the rank of second–in–command by Admiral Gar Stazi. Dahl was involved in the Galactic Alliance's attack over Ralltiir and the evacuation efforts of the planet Dac.
            Anj Dahl, a female Human, joined the remnants of the Galactic Alliance several years after the end of the Sith–Imperial War in 130 ABY. She joined the prestigious Rogue Squadron shortly after.[1] Seven years later, Dahl accompanied fellow Rogue Squadron member and Mon Calamari Monia Gahan as she attempted to persuade her uncle Gial Gahan—a former member of the Galactic Alliance Triumvirate and Duros Admiral Gar Stazi's friend—to supply data on the Imperious, an advanced class of Star Destroyer under construction at the Mon Calamari Shipyards. Dahl acquired supplies, including parts, bacta, and a bottle of Corellian brandy for the Dug and fellow Rogue Squadron member Andurgo.[2]
            After Monia Gahan successfully convinced her uncle to give the Alliance fleet intel on the Imperious, Dahl and Gahan flew the Scarlet Star, a modified YT-2400 light freighter,[1] back to the Indomitable and the fleet to report to Admiral Stazi. They barely missed the fight between Andurgo and Hondo Karr, a former Imperial stormtrooper. After the Rogue Leader Jhoram Bey broke up the fight between Karr and Andurgo, the Weequay reprimanded Dahl and Gahan for making Admiral Stazi wait.[2]
            Later she fought at the Battle of Mon Calamari. When Ronto had to eject into Dac's atmosphere, Dahl informed Andurgo that she would skin him alive if the Dug's showboating led to Ronto's death.[3]
            After Bey was promoted by Admiral Stazi to the second-in-command of the Galactic Alliance fleet, Dahl was promoted to Rogue Leader.[4]
            Sometime after the Battle of Ralltiir, the Galactic Alliance fleet made its way to the Arkanis sector in the Outer Rim. Dahl and the other members of Rogue Squadron were briefed on their next mission by Jhoran Bey, who informed Dahl and Rogue Squadron that the fleet planned to
            She accompanied Hondo Karr on a mission to smuggle Mon Calamari refugees from a moon of Da Soocha. While the mission was a success, Karr did not return from it, as he was able to reunite with his wife and return to Mandalorian ways.[5]
            Anj Dahl was known for being eager and talented. She was also known to have been mischievous, starting trouble between her fellow Rogue Squadron members just for her own entertainment. Because having spent most of her life as a young adult in the Galactic Alliance Core Fleet, Dahl felt that everything in her life could be gone anytime. As a result, she embraced anything that seemed fun to her. Dahl excelled at scrounging, and was capable of acquiring ship parts and supplies from most spaceports without alerting the authorities. Her abilities at this were boosted when sympathizers to the Galactic Alliance Core Fleet assisted her.[1] Dahl did not enjoy being Rogue Leader, feeling that her predecessor, Jhoram Bey, was better at leading the Rogue Squadron than her. She viewed her fellow squad members, including Hondo Karr, as her friends, and was loyal to them. Dahl was not willing to lose any of the Rogue Squadron members on her watch, and did not wish to leave a man behind.[5]
            Dahl spoke and comprehended Galactic Basic Standard. She was also capable of understanding Binary. Dahl was skilled in unarmed combat. She possessed a padded flight suit, a blaster pistol, a datapad, and a comlink.[1]
            Anj Dahl was created by John Ostrander, the writer of the Star Wars Legacy comic series, for the Indomitable story arc. She later appeared in the thirty-sixth and forty-second issues of the Legacy series. Dahl also appeared in the second, third, and fifth issues of Star Wars: Legacy's followup miniseries, Star Wars: Legacy—War. Dahl received an entry in the Legacy Era Campaign Guide, which was published by Wizards of the Coast and released on March 17, 2009. Dahl was drawn by Omar Francia for the Indomitable and Renegade storylines. In the story Rogue's End, she was penciled by Kajo Baldisimo; Dahl was drawn by Jan Duursema in The Fate of Dac and in her three appearances in Star Wars: Legacy—War.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anj_Dahl</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAnjDahl</string></dict>

One day, Graf's parents were kidnapped by agents of the Galactic Empire, leaving her and her brother Milo alone on a remote planet.[2] The siblings then decided to undertake a dangerous journey across Wild Space to rescue their parents. At some point during their adventures, the Graf siblings found themselves looking for allies on an ancient frontier world, but fell into a trap laid by Captain Visler Korda, an Imperial officer.[4] Later on, Graf and her brother managed to trace their parents' latest clue to a remote jungle planet that housed a frightening beast.[5]
            Eventually, Lina became a commander in the Alliance to Restore the Republic. At one point, she and her team crash landed on the planet Mustafar, not far from Darth Vader's castle.[3]
            Years later, Lina became the great-aunt of Emil Graf. On at least one occasion, she shared with him a story of a thief who frequently stole from Dex's Diner, only to be tracked down by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and have the stolen possessions returned.[6]
            Lina Graf was born around 28 BBY[1] in the waning years of the Galactic Republic to cartographers Auric and Rhyssa Graf aboard the family's Mu-class shuttle,  the Whisper Bird.The Grafs also had a son, Milo Graf, one year after Lina's birth. Due to the nature of their parents, Lina and Milo grew up travelling across Wild Space as Auric and his wife mapped out the uncharted star systems and sold them off to various buyers.
            Lina's parents' travels, while primarily based in Wild Space,[2] also encompassed the Outer Rim Territories[7] and reached as far as the Core Worlds. While visiting the planet Coruscant, Lina ate at Dex's Diner and developed a love of the nerfburgers served there. On one occasion, she sat beside Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi at Dex's Diner and was present when he began his pursuit of the Pa'lowick thief Tri Tellon.[6] Early in their explorations, before the outbreak of the Clone Wars[8], the Grafs visited the oceanic planet of Mon Cala, and Auric made many friends among the Mon Calamari people.[7] These travels were not without dangers, one instance taking Lina to a mining yard on Cedonne, where she was nearly flattened by a loadlifter.[9]. In another instance on Chankin, the Grafs were attacked by pirates, and Lina and Milo witnessed their father use the Whisper Bird's weapons system to disable those of the pirates.[10] During an excursion to the planet Indoumodo, the Graf siblings played speeder tag with their parents on speeder bikes through the Termite forests of Northern Indoumodo, the younger Grafs losing after crashing into a massive greddleback termite mound. The family's droid, CR-8R, recorded the game using holo-drones for posterity.[11] Around 20 BBY,[12] when Lina was eight years old, her father brought her to explore the ice caves of Orto Plutonia, where he taught her to scale the sheer cave walls and use an ice pick.[11] A year later, around 19 BBY,[13] Lina visited a village on Ikari, where she encountered a tribal elder whose sensor mask enhanced his senses of sight, hearing and smell, allowing him to hunt better than the rest of his tribe.[5]
            Around 18 BBY[14], the Graf family was mapping out on uncharted swamp planet on the edge of wild space, a planet which the Graf's had exclusive rights to map thanks to the work of their agent, Dil Pexton. Whilst on the planet, Lina received a holo message from her brother asking for her assistance as he had wandered off into the swamplands with the family's pet Kowakian Monkey-Lizard, Morq, despite the warnings of his parents. Lina and the family droid, CR-8R, ventured out on a landspeeder in search of the younger Graf using a tracker their mother had put on his speeder bike and eventually located him as well as his damaged vehicle. Milo had discovered and was trying to capture a species of animal that he described as similar to a Sullustan ash-rabbit although the creature proved too quick for him which was what led to him asking Lina for help.[2]
            The group eventually got close enough for Milo to aim his father's wrist mounted net launcher at the creature but before he could take the shot a creepervine grabbed Lina by her ankles with the intention of devouring her. Despite her struggling the young Graf girl was unable to break free from the creatures vines so she went to grab her fusion cutter out of her toolbelt but it had fallen as she was lifted into the air. Luckily, Morq was able to scoop up the tool and deliver it the Lina allowing her to cut through the vines and come crashing down the the swampy floor, injuring her shoulder in the process.[2]
            After making sure Lina was ok, CR-8R received an impromptu data load from an unknown source that was encrypted in an ancient dialect which he began to decrypt. The group then travelled back to camp as Lina and her brother was worried they'd be in trouble for wandering off too far. When they arrived back at camp their parents were nowhere to be seen and all the equipment they had brought was also gone, only the tents remained. After some investigation the children located their mother's necklace and a holo recorder buried under the mud which Lina was able to clean up and review the footage stored on there. The group watched a recording which showed a squadron of stormtroopers led by a Captain Korda confront Auric and Rhyssa, demanding the hand over their maps and other data for free in service of the Empire. In order to avoid any trouble, Lina's mother used her datapad to transfer some of their data over to the Imperials although this was not enough. Korda informed the couple that Darth Vader himself had tasked him with the capture of the cartographers so that they could personally serve the needs of the Empire and when they resisted the stormtroopers beat and arrested them explaining why Rhyssa's necklace was left behind. In the struggle the couple let it slip that their children were nearby so Korda ordered his men to destroy the families ship, the Whisper Bird, and to track down and eliminate Lina and her brother.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lina_Graf</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLinaGraf</string></dict>

Gabon served in the Starfighter Corps of the New Republic military during the cold war.
            In 34 ABY, during the cold war, Mia Gabon served in the New Republic military's Starfighter Corps as the pilot of a T-85 X-wing starfighter. Along with two other pilots, Kazuda Xiono and Hugh Sion, she was sent on a mission to rendezvous with Commander Poe Dameron of the Resistance in order to deliver intelligence. Shortly after arriving at the rendezvous point, the three pilots were ambushed by Major Elrik Vonreg of the First Order, and she and Sion were concerned that they wouldn't be able to complete their mission.

        <key>Shada D'ukal</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.456.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shada D'ukal was a deceptively decorative-looking mercenary from a mysterious militaristic order of female warriors known as the Mistryl Shadow Guard.
            Shada had come from a family with several uncles. She joined the Shadow Guard in 3 BBY[3]. In 0 BBY, Shada was a member of the six-person Shadow Guard team led by Manda D'ulin, when they were approached by the scientists working on the Hammertong project to guard a prototype of the Death Star's superlaser. When the mission went wrong, Shada and her friend and comrade Karoly D'ulin stole the Strike Cruiser being used to transport the prototype, and escaped to Tatooine, where they posed as the Tonnika sisters in an effort to hire a freighter to help take a section of the device back to Emberlene.
            By 8 ABY, Shada was traveling the galaxy aboard the freighter The Fury with Mistryl trainee Dunc T'racen, when the pair of them were caught up in a complex con run by Ghitsa Dogder and Fenig Nabon. After this, Shada became bodyguard for the smuggler chief Mazzic. In this job, she appeared with plaited hair and a blank expression—until trouble started. Then she was all business, throwing enameled zenji needles with lethal accuracy and using her more-than-capable combat skills to protect the smuggler chief.
            She was present at the meeting on Trogan where she defended Mazzic and later at the meeting on Hijarna where she assisted at the formation of the Smugglers' Alliance.
            In 19 ABY, Shada prevented Karoly from assassinating Mazzic, and came under punishment from the Eleven who led the Mistryl. She left Mazzic's employment to avoid the Mistryl hunter teams, seeking to join up with the New Republic. Instead, Leia Organa Solo offered Shada's services to Talon Karrde, who was heading into the Kathol sector to locate a copy of the Caamas Document. Shada accompanied him, and the two grew fond of each other. When Karrde located information that revealed the truth about the fake Grand Admiral Thrawn, Shada was there to stop the cloned Major Grodin Tierce from killing Gilad Pellaeon and a Mistryl leader, Paloma D'asima. As a result the hunter teams were called off and Shada officially joined Karrde's new joint intelligence organization, taking the role of Karrde's unofficial second in command that had been open since Mara Jade left the organization.
            During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Shada continued to serve as Karrde's lieutenant and business-partner. She assisted in transporting Jedi Initiates from Yavin 4 to Coruscant. There were rumors that she had passed on details of the Hammertong device to Karrde, allowing Booster Terrik to mount a superlaser aboard the Errant Venture.

        <key>Githany</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.459.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Githany, nicknamed Githa, was a female Human who fought as a Sith Lord in the New Sith Wars, wielding both a lightsaber and a lightwhip. Originally a Jedi who had trained under Master Handa, Githany defected to the Brotherhood of Darkness, betraying her former lover, Kiel Charny, and delivering to Lord Skere Kaan vital information concerning the battle strategy of the Army of Light. During her time at the Sith Academy on Korriban, she met, became smitten with, and trained her aspiring fellow student, Bane.
            After her training was complete, Githany was sent to the planet Ruusan for one final strike against the Jedi. She manipulated the youth Darovit into murdering Charny with the Jedi General's own lightsaber, and then took the young boy as her apprentice. Despite her defection, she abandoned her fellow Sith Lords when she learned of Kaan's desire to use the thought bomb, a highly destructive use of the dark side of the Force. However, she was delayed while attempting to escape, ensuring that she perished along with her fellow Sith on Ruusan.
            Githany was born on an unidentified world somewhere between two and three decades before the Ruusan campaign, and her parents gave her to the Jedi Order as a toddler. She trained under the Cathar Jedi Master Handa alongside a fellow Padawan named Kiel Charny, this being an era when multiple apprentices were still permissible.[1]
            During her training, the young Padawan lost touch with the Force, unable to cope with something so vast, leading to her psyche creating walls to protect herself from such power.[1] Only through the patient help of her Jedi Master was she able to break down these walls and continue her training. Later on, as she approached adulthood, Githany began to fall in love with Charny. Their Master discovered the affair and was enraged. The Cathar demanded that the two refrain from any further relationship. While Kiel acquiesced to his Master's demands, Githany refused and fled the Jedi, eventually joining the Sith. Charny, forced to choose between his love and the Jedi, chose the Jedi, heeding the advice of his close friend, Valenthyne Farfalla.[1]
            During the early months of the Ruusan campaign, Githany turned to the dark side, and joined the Brotherhood of Darkness, though for a while she kept her treachery secret. Upon her defection, she met with the Sith Lord Skere Kaan and the other Dark Lords in their camp, and turned over valuable strategic information pertaining to the Jedi to the Brotherhood, notably Lord Hoth's battle plans, which she had obtained due to her relationship with Charny, one of Hoth's most prominent generals. After the Sith were satisfied with what she had to offer, Githany was then sent to the Sith academy on Korriban where she would begin her training as a Sith adept.[1]
            There, she quickly made allies with another student named Bane, and used him in her scheme to defeat the top student at the school, Sirak. Seeing potential in him, Githany secretly began to train Bane, even as every other Sith Master refused to do so, teaching him the art of Force lightning. It was during this secret training that Githany began to develop feelings for Bane, even sharing a kiss with him. Bane eventually fought Sirak and won, but to Githany's dismay, he allowed the Zabrak to live. Feeling that Bane had failed to live up to her expectations, Githany allied herself with Sirak. Along with fellow students Yevra and Llokay, Githany and Sirak ambushed Bane when he returned from the Valley of the Dark Lords. During the ensuing fight, Githany once again changed her alliance, killing Yevra and Llokay. Bane then killed Sirak.[1]
            Though she would eventually betray Bane on Ruusan, Githany once again allied herself with him.[1][5]
            With the need for more Sith on Ruusan to fight against the Army of Light, Lord Kaan called for all students on Korriban to be made into Dark Lords, Githany among them.[1] On Ruusan, Githany was given the task of assassinating Darth Bane, meet up with him on the world of Ambria where she planned to poison him with synox, as well as with the application of Rock worrt venom to her lips. Bane was given three lethal doses of this poison in the guise of a kiss, yet he nonetheless survived by going to a healer on the planet. The healer, knowing Bane was of the Dark side, refused, but then accepted when Bane threatened his daughter.[1]
            On Ruusan, Bane returned, interrupting a meeting of Kaan's inner circle. Despite her surprise at his survival, Githany joined the other Lords in welcoming Bane back into the fold. Feigning forgiveness of Kaan, Bane rejoined the Brotherhood and participated in the council of war, assisting in the development of a plan to flush the Jedi out with their combined dark side powers.[2]
            While their minions attacked the Jedi in a diversionary feint, Githany, Bane, Kaan, and the other Dark Lords gathered on a high precipice, where Bane directed the Sith in a powerful ritual. With their combined Force powers, a great wave of destruction thundered across the surface of Ruusan, scorching the once lush forests and decimating Republic and Jedi forces by the thousands. After the success of this powerful ritual, Lord Kaan led his forces into combat with the Jedi, and Githany followed.[1][6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Githany</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemGithany</string></dict>

She was onboard the Fulminatrix when it traveled to the Ileenium system in around the year 34 ABY in order to destroy the Resistance base located there on the planet D'Qar. During the attack she was stationed on the vessel's bridge alongside its Captain Moden Canady, and when the lone Resistance pilot Poe Dameron began attacking the Fulminatrix in his T-70 X-wing starfighter Black One she disdainfully commented that his attack would fail to penetrate their armor. Canady retorted that Dameron was only aiming to destroy the dreadnought's surface cannons, and was proven right when the Resistance pilot destroyed the final turrets and signaled for a squadron of Resistance bombers to attack the Fulminatrix. Despite suffering massive casualties, the bombers were able to destroy the dreadnought, killing Goneril and the rest of the crew.[2]

        <key>Val</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.462.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Val was a female human[2] criminal who worked with fellow outlaw Tobias Beckett during the reign of the Galactic Empire.[1] Val was a no-nonsense and occasionally prickly woman who was a crack shot with a blaster rifle.[2]
            Val was highly secretive about her past, including her full name.[3] All that was known about her past was that she grew up on Solarine[5] and her father was a musician, and she was named after the valachord musical instrument.[3]
            By the reign of the Galactic Empire, Val was already working with the scoundrel Tobias Beckett and the Ardennian pilot Rio Durant.[1] They formed a crew which carried out risky though profitable heists.[6] She and Beckett, in addition, shared a romantic relationship.[1]
            Ten years before the Battle of Yavin, during a war on Mimban, Val infiltrated the Mimban Stormtrooper troops along with Beckett and Durant. There, they met the young Han Solo, who wanted to join them as part of their crew. Val didn't agree in letting Solo join them, but Beckett decided to give the boy an opportunity by leading him to be locked for insubordination. Solo was ultimately able to escape with the Wookiee Chewbacca, who was initially intended to devour them, so Beckett decided to let them join his crew.[1]
            Once they arrived at Vandor, Beckett's crew spied the 20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport that they had been planning to steal in order to acquire its Coaxium cargo to pay Beckett's debt with the crime lord Dryden Vos, leader of Crimson Dawn. As the crew spied, they wished for the absence of Enfys Nest and the Cloud-Riders the next day. That night, before sleeping with the campfire they had made, Val kissed Beckett while they told about what they planned to do with their share from the heist.[1]
            The next morning, while Beckett along Solo and Chewbacca managed to take possession of the cargo wagon by getting rid of the range troopers and having Chewbacca separating it with his strength, Val prepared to detonate the bridge to avoid the Conveyex to cross the tunnel while Solo and Beckett hooked the wagon to their starship.[1]
            Unfortunately, Nest and the Cloud-Riders appeared on scene with the intentions to steal the Coaxium from Beckett's hands, even managing to fatally wound Rio. Though Val managed to take out some of Nest's marauders, she realized that the Conveyex was getting too close to her and that there would be no time to abandon her position without letting the crew to steal the Conveyex. Communicating with Beckett about the change of plans, she told Beckett that she loved him and subsequently detonated the bomb, blowing up herself and destroying the bridge.[1]
            Ultimately, Val's sacrifice was in vain because Solo was forced to let go the cargo in order to save Beckett and Chewie from certain death. Once all had finished, Beckett punched Solo in the face because of Val's death and their failure in acquiring the Coaxium. Later on, while visiting Vos with the empty hands, Vos expressed his condolences to Beckett for Val's death.[1]
            Val was portrayed by Thandie Newton in the 2018 Star Wars Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story,released in 2018.[1] Newton's casting in the film was first announced on February 21, 2017.[7] Her name was revealed with a set of promotional images sent out to various news websites alongside the teaser trailer.[8]
            In the DVD commentary of Solo, Newton revealed her thoughts about Val's backstory which she discussed with the filmmakers, stating that she likes to feel that Tobias Beckett saved Val from a dangerous situation at some point and that it was perilous for him to do that, earning Val's gratitude and loyalty in the process.[9]
            The look of Val was inspired by pictures of female members of the Viet Cong and Black Panther Party, along with civil rights activist Angela Davis.[10] Screenwriter Jon Kasdan expressed regret of having Val killed off early in the film, saying that Newton's acting was quite good and it would have been interesting having her playing a larger role in the film.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Val</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemVal</string></dict>
        <key>Lonna Vash</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.463.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lonna Vash was a female Human Jedi Master serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a member of the Jedi High Council during the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War. She was one of the Masters who banished Meetra Surik from the Order.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Lonna Vash was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, attaining the rank of Jedi Master in the years prior to the Mandalorian Wars. Earning a seat on the Jedi High Council and stationed at the new Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Vash was present when the Council reassigned Jedi Masters Xamar, Raana Tey, Q'Anilia, Feln and Lucien Draay following their failed stewardship of the Order's academy on Taris and their inability to foresee the massacre of their Padawans by the rogue apprentice, Zayne Carrick.[2]
            Following the war with the Mandalorians and the Jedi Civil War, led by Darth Malak and Darth Revan, Master Vash retained her seat on the Council and presided over the trial of Master Meetra Surik and decreed the former Revanchist was part of the Order no longer. Despite outright condemning Surik for her actions during the war, she felt Surik had changed since the end of the conflict, and spoke against Master Atris' assertion that the wound Surik carried was a sign of dark side corruption. After the trial and Surik's exile from the Order, Vash regretted not revealing the truth of the woman's banishment; the Council feared the sway she held over people's hearts and her ability to form strong connections with many.[1]
            Following the disbanding of the Order during the Jedi Purge commenced by a group known as the Sith Triumvirate, Vash went to ground and managed to escape Coruscant. Not long after, Master Atris called a conclave on the world of Katarr aimed at finding the threat that stalked the Jedi. Neither Vash or Atris went to the meeting, but after the devastation by the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Nihilus that swept the planet, Vash and the surviving Masters went into self-imposed exile. Like her fellow Council members Kavar and Zez-Kai Ell, she believed that Atris had died on Katarr; she was in truth responsible for what had happened, as it was she who leaked knowledge of the conclave to draw out the Sith. On Kavar's suggestion, they traveled to different planets and hid their presence in the Force in hopes that the Sith would think themselves victorious and step from the shadows. They sought out places touched by war so as to be more difficult to detect, and because they thought there was a chance Surik would return to such places, if only to try and make peace with what happened there during the war. In her exile, Lonna Vash went to Korriban and took up residence in the halls of the abandoned Sith Academy there.[1]
            During her exile the Sith Lord Darth Sion arrived on the planet and captured Vash, torturing her within the academy's dungeons in an effort to draw out Surik. Upon Surik's arrival on Korriban her companion, Visas Marr, sensed Sion execute Master Vash. Entering the Valley of the Dark Lords, Surik and her companions ventured into the academy and were surprised when its door slammed shut behind them. Continuing on into the building's depths, Surik discovered Vash's body lying in a pool of blood; the droid HK-47's diagnostics confirmed that Vash had been dead for no more than an hour. The bounty hunter Mira believed that the Jedi Master was left as a "message" to Surik and her companions.[1]
            Searching Vash's body, Surik discovered that the Jedi Master had created a user account under her name in the academy's security system. This account would make it possible for her to open the front door and escape in case of danger. Using this account, Surik fled from the academy after a short battle with Sion, whom she proved to be unable to kill.[1]
            Lonna Vash's role was bigger in the original vision of the developers, Obsidian Entertainment, but like many other incomplete things it had to be cut because of the forced premature release of the game.
            She was planned to be found by the player on M4-78, a planet populated by droids, where she came searching for Meetra Surik with her Padawan, Kaah Ohtok. The corresponding conversation Surik has with Vash was even recorded and put in the game file, but, like the incomplete planet, was never used in the actual game. However, as Vash was a Council member shown in an important cut scene, the developers placed her dead body on the also-incomplete Korriban to explain what happened to her.
            Master Vash's voiceovers from M4-78 suggest the female Jedi Master in actuality had completely different views from rest of the Jedi Council not only on Surik's exile, but also on dealing with the Sith. Her will to fight pushed her to attack the colonists on the droid planet. Despite her previous statements to Surik at the trial, when player reaches Lonna in the main Behaviour Core, the Jedi Master calls the Exile "Jedi", and if the player chooses a dialogue option stating that she's no Jedi, she replies that it depends on the point of view on who can be called by the term "Jedi" and that she actually considered Surik a Jedi.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lonna_Vash</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLonnaVash</string></dict>

The younger sister of twin brothers Thexan and Arcann, she displayed incredible strength in the Force since early childhood, but was also difficult to control, causing Valkorion to lock her away on Nathema, fearing that she could one day challenge him. In Nathema's Sanitarium Vaylin was subjected to intense mental and physical torture that broke her innocence, turning her into a sadistic person with no empathy for others. Senya attempted to get her daughter out, but was stopped from doing so by Valkorion, causing Vaylin to blame her mother for her suffering and develop an intense hatred for her. Subjected to a mental conditioning only Valkorion knew about, Vaylin was eventually allowed to return to Zakuul, where she bided her time instead of immediately striking back. When Arcann arranged for their father's death, blaming it on the Outlander, Vaylin supported him and became the High Justice to the new Eternal Emperor, who conquered both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic in less than a year.
            Five years into Arcann's reign, the Outlander was released from imprisonment in carbonite by Lana Beniko and Vaylin personally led the pursuit, but was unable to prevent them from escaping. The fugitives eventually fled the planet on the Gravestone with Senya's help, giving Vaylin another reason to hate her mother who now fought against her own children. During the battle of Asylum Vaylin fought her mother and revealed to her that Thexan was killed by Arcann. Vaylin personally led a series of reprisal bombardments to lure the Outlander out of hiding and inspected the Gilded Star when Senya assisted the Outlander in raiding the treasury ship while wearing Vaylin's face as disguise. During the Battle of Odessen Vaylin turned against Arcann, revealing his whereabout to the Alliance while luring Senya away to confront her mother on her own, though Arcann later returned the favor by stopping Vaylin from landing a blow, after which Senya took him away. Vaylin returned to Zakuul, where SCORPIO has claimed the Eternal Throne in their absence and was surprised when the droid offered the Throne to her, offering to act as Vaylin's advisor instead.
            As the new Eternal Empress, Vaylin led a hunt for Arcann and Senya, confronting her mother on Ord Mantell where she slaughtered a host of Knights of Zakuul loyal to her mother. Tracking them to Voss, Vaylin launched an invasion to draw her family out of hiding, but was unable to kill her family because of GEMINI droids' newfound self-preservation given to them by SCORPIO. Using the rumors of the Outlander's death, Vaylin and SCORPIO launched an assault on the Gravestone, taking control of the only vessel capable of fighting the Eternal Fleet. While fighting against an Alliance counter-attack, Vaylin almost killed the Outlander when Valkorion, whose spirit resided in the Outlander's body, activated her conditioning, making Vaylin aware of it for the first time. SCORPIO took the Gravestone and the Eternal Fleet to Iokath, where Vaylin led her Zakuulan forces to reclaim the Eternal Fleet from ARIES, while also obtaining a way to restore GEMINI to their original programming. Celebrating her accomplishments at the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin, the Empress was confronted by the Outlander and Arcann, who joined forces to stop her reign. Vaylin returned to Nathema, where the Anomid scientist Jarak responsible for her conditioning helped her break her bounds, after which she immediately launched an Assault on Odessen. During the battle the Outlander taunted Vaylin into a direct confrontation on the surface, in which Vaylin was killed, though Valkorion secretly absorbed her spirit's strength and used it to conquer the Outlander's mental defenses. As the Outlander fought Valkorion for control of their body, Valkorion send Vaylin's enslaved spirit against his opponent, but instead the Outlander freed Vaylin from Valkorion's control using Dramath's holocron. Vaylin joined the Outlander and the rest of her family in fighting against Valkorion, which resulted in the final death of the Immortal Emperor, allowing Vaylin's spirit to depart in peace.
            Vaylin was the daughter of Senya Tirall and Valkorion, the Immortal Emperor of Zakuul, the capital world of the Eternal Empire. She was the younger sister of twin brothers Arcann and Thexan and inherited the incredible strength in the Force from her father, who by that point was over a thousand years old. Before she was even born, Vaylin was so powerful that she made the furniture move while she was still in her mother's womb. As a toddler, Vaylin tore apart droids and one time crippled a guard who dropped a ball she tossed.[5] The children played together, sparring in the shadow of the Eternal Fleet or running away and living in the Endless Swamp for a month.[6] She was loved by her mother, who spent a lot of time with Vaylin, playing together in the fields and forests of Zakuul. Senya tried to teach Vaylin to rely less on the Force and more on her hands, at one time stopping her from levitating a wood-carven toy. Vaylin watched as her older brothers began their combat training against the Knights of Zakuul and, willing to be like them, tried to do the same against an old, rusty set of Knight armor when she was alone in the woods. Frustrated by her inability to land simple Force attacks on her training dummy, Vaylin became angry and in her rage destroyed the entire suit. Once she was old enough to begin her own combat training, Vaylin became frustrated at having to rely on wooden sparring sticks instead of her Force abilities. During one exercise she became frustrated at her defeats and unleashed her powers, levitating several Knights at once, before crushing them in their own armor, with the incident observed by her father.[1] As she grew up, the Immortal Emperor noticed similarities between himself and Vaylin, which both pleased and frightened him, and he decided to keep a tight leash on his favorite child.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vaylin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemVaylin</string></dict>
        <key>Ursa Wren</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.465.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ursa Wren was a human female Mandalorian warrior, the wife of Alrich Wren, the mother of Tristan and Sabine Wren, and the leader and Countess of Clan Wren. She was part of Death Watch, a Mandalorian splinter group that took over Mandalore during the Clone Wars. Mandalore was occupied by the Galactic Empire after the war's end, and Sabine Wren attended the Imperial Academy on the planet. Wren fled the Academy, however, bringing shame upon her family.
            Due to her daughter's actions, Clan Wren were treated with suspicion by the other clans. Ursa's husband was kept as a hostage by Viceroy Gar Saxon to ensure her family's cooperation while her son Tristan was forced to join the Imperial Super Commandos. In an effort to protect Sabine, Ursa did not search for her daughter. In public, Ursa sided with the Empire and the Emperor's Hand Saxon. In 2 BBY, Ursa was reunited with her daughter Sabine in the Wren Stronghold on Krownest, who had joined the rebellion and had returned to seek her family's support for the rebels.
            Unwilling to antagonize Saxon, Ursa was initially cold towards her daughter and the rebel emissaries, Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger. Ursa's pragmatism clashed with Sabine's idealism. In an attempt to save Sabine's life, Ursa attempted to trade the rebels and the Darksaber to Saxon, in exchange for Sabine's pardon. However, Saxon betrayed Ursa, reneged on the offer, and ordered his men to exterminate Clan Wren for their crimes against Mandalore and the Empire. Ursa and the rest of Clan Wren joined forces with the rebels and the Journeyman Protector Fenn Rau, who was able to sneak into the compound and reacquire the rebels' weapons, and fought in a skirmish against Saxon's forces. Saxon's forces were soon overpowered, and Sabine and Saxon engaged in a duel, with Sabine defeating Saxon, but sparing his life. When Saxon tried to kill Sabine, Ursa shot and killed Saxon, ending the skirmish. With Saxon's death, Mandalore would fall into civil war once more, with Sabine vowing to find Mandalore's rightful leader.
            As Countess, Ursa led her clan's warriors against the forces of Clan Saxon and the Empire, though they faced overwhelming odds. When Ezra came to Krownest seeking their aid, she initially refused as her own forces were stretched too thin, but after witnessing her daughter prepare to leave she relented and allowed them to take any ships and warriors able and willing to help, citing that she owed the rebels for restoring her family. Her clan's aid allowed some rebels to escape total destruction at the Battle of Atollon and some of them returned the favor by coming to Mandalore to help rescue her husband. Ursa and Tristan were nearly killed by Sabine's resurrected weapon, the Duchess, but the Countess was reunited with her husband and provided technical support on a mission to destroy the weapon.
            Ursa Wren was a member of Death Watch,[1] a group of Mandalorian warriors who opposed Mandalore's pacifist government during the Clone Wars.[6] She was the head of Clan Wren[2] and married Alrich.[5] One year into the war, her daughter, Sabine Wren, was born.[7] Ursa later bore a son named Tristan.[2] In 19 BBY,[8] Death Watch—with the help of the Sith Lord Darth Maul and his Shadow Collective—took over Mandalore. Maul slew the leader of Death Watch, Pre Vizsla, and ruled Mandalore[9] for the remainder of the Clone Wars.[10] At the end of the war, Mandalore was besieged by the Galactic Republic, however the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire[11] and occupied the planet.[12]
            During the Imperial Era, Ursa's daughter Sabine enlisted in Mandalore's Imperial Academy,[13] however she fled the Academy[4] after the Empire forced her to build weapons which they used on the Mandalorian people.[3] One of these weapons was the Arc Pulse Generator known as the "Duchess", which was capable of reacting with the beskar alloy inside Mandalorian armor and incinerating the wearers.[5] When Sabine spoke up against the Empire, Ursa and the rest of her family stood by the Empire and denounced her daughter.[3]
            Wren's desertion shamed her family, prompting Ursa to join the Empire.[4] Ursa's husband  was made a hostage of Governor Gar Saxon, the Viceroy of Mandalore and the Emperor's Hand. Her son Tristan was forced to join Saxon's Imperial Super Commando.[2] Meanwhile, after working as a bounty hunter for a time,[14] the young Wren joined a group of rebels who operated against the Empire on the planet Lothal,[15] and eventually became part of a larger rebel movement.[16] For years, Ursa did not search for her daughter in order to protect her from Saxon, who was seeking every opportunity to destroy Clan Wren.[2]
            In the hopes of gathering up Mandalorian warriors for an attack on Lothal, Sabine, Ezra Bridger, Kanan Jarrus and the Journeyman Protector Fenn Rau set out on a mission to Krownest to recruit Sabine's clan in a fight against the Empire. However, as Sabine expected, her clan set up an ambush for the rebels' ship, which was forced to crash-land on the snowy surface of the planet. After meeting Sabine's brother Tristan, she and the rest were taken before Ursa, who almost had Sabine placed into a cell before she stopped upon seeing the darksaber. She then demanded that the Jedi surrender their lightsabers before she spoke with her daughter.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ursa_Wren</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemUrsaWren</string></dict>
        <key>Komari Vosa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.466.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Komari Vosa, a Force-sensitive Human female, was a fallen Jedi who served as leader of the Bando Gora during the final years of the Galactic Republic. A former Padawan of Jedi Master Dooku, who remembered Vosa as an excellent pupil, Vosa ultimately turned to the dark side of the Force following her banishment from the Jedi Order. Amassing an army of mindless slaves and assassins, Vosa became a cult leader whose influence reached across the galaxy, allowing her to establish connections with powerful crime lords such as the Hutt Cartel or the Dugs of Malastare.
            As her influence expanded, Vosa came to the attention of Darth Sidious—the Dark Lord of the Sith who conspired to topple the Republic from within. Viewing the former Jedi as a threat to his own plans for the future, the Sith Lord ordered her termination. The execution of this task was entrusted to Sidious' new Sith apprentice, Darth Tyranus, who was in fact Dooku, the Jedi Master that trained Vosa prior to his own experience falling from the light side of the Force. Rather than killing Vosa in person, Tyranus opted to place a bounty on his fallen apprentice. A mercenary who was skilled enough to defeat a warrior trained in the ways of the Force would, as Tyranus reasoned, make an ideal template for the clone army in development on Kamino.
            The contest was ultimately won by Jango Fett, one of the bounty hunters whom Tyranus hired to hunt and neutralize Vosa for the reward of five million credits. After tracking Vosa to her citadel on Kohlma, one of the moons of Bogden, Fett defeated the leader of the Bando Gora in spite of her Force powers and lightsaber skills. Tyranus, who witnessed the battle from the shadows, asphyxiated Vosa by way of the Force and subsequently persuaded Fett to be cloned. In the years following Vosa's death, her lightsabers were given to Asajj Ventress, a Separatist assassin who aspired to join the ranks of the Sith with Tyranus as her mentor.
            A Force-sensitive Human female, Komari Vosa was recruited as a young child by the Jedi Order[5] in accordance with tradition[6] during the last century of the Galactic Republic. After completing her studies as a Jedi Initiate, Vosa became the Padawan learner of the Jedi Master Dooku in 50 BBY. Despite possessing a volatile temperament, Vosa proved to be a prodigious student in the ways of the Force,[5] earning the respect of her Master who regarded Vosa as an excellent apprentice.[3]
            Komari Vosa accompanied Master Dooku and a Jedi strike force to the planet Galidraan[5] in 44 BBY[7] with orders from the Jedi High Council to neutralize the True Mandalorians.[4] The Jedi virtually annihilated their Mandalorian adversaries in the Battle of Galidraan; Vosa herself demonstrated considerable skill with a lightsaber when she personally killed twenty experienced soldiers in combat. Though the Council later came to regret the massacre on Galidraan, Dooku was impressed by his apprentice's natural talents and believed that Vosa's future was all but secure in the ranks of the Order.[5]
            Vosa's status as a rising star in the Jedi Order was cut short when her Master barred her from participating in the Jedi Trials. Dooku, along with the members of the Jedi Council, became aware of Vosa's secret infatuation with her legendary Master. This and her aggressive demeanor convinced the Order to end Vosa's training, thus deeming her unfit to become a Jedi Knight. Enraged at what she perceived as a betrayal by her Master and the Council, Vosa fled the Jedi Temple and joined a Jedi task force deployed to stop the Bando Gora's activities on Baltizaar. The mission was a disaster, however. The team was decimated and forced to retreat back to Coruscant; many Jedi lost their lives and others were captured, including Vosa.[5]
            Though the Order believed her to be dead, in truth Komari Vosa remained alive and was held as a prisoner by the mysterious cult in a dilapidated citadel on Kohlma, a burial moon orbiting Bogden. Subjected to torture and other forms of cruelty, Vosa was driven both mad and into the dark side of the Force. Embracing her rage, the deranged Jedi defeated her tormentors and replaced them as the new leader of the Bando Gora.[5]
            Komari Vosa—now a Dark Jedi and high priestess of the Bando Gora—maintained the citadel on Kholma as her base of operations from where she monitored her cult's activities throughout the galaxy[5] with the aid of her chief lieutenant.[3] Under Vosa's direction, the Bando Gora became a horrific icon of terror and intrigue, especially within the criminal underworld that became essential in her plot to expand the Bando Gora's influence and power. In order to do so, Vosa implanted brainwashing agents into death sticks, intending to use narcotics as a recruiting tool for the Bando Gora.[5] The poisonous substances—mind-altering neurotoxins—were developed and conditioned to suppress individuality and free will, thus enabling Vosa to use her Force abilities to turn drug-addicts into mindless spies and assassins.[3] This form of slavery gradually built her a small army of warriors that Vosa deployed on the enemies of her cult.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Komari_Vosa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemKomariVosa</string></dict>
        <key>Sabine Wren</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.467.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sabine Wren is a human female Mandalorian warrior and was a revolutionary leader during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Her artistry during the rebellion inspired the symbol of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and her claim over the ancient Mandalorian weapon known as the Darksaber made her a symbol to Clan Wren and the hopes of freeing her people's homeworld of Mandalore from the rule of the Empire.
            Prior to becoming a rebel, Wren was a cadet at the Imperial Academy of Mandalore. She built weapons she believed would be used for peace but were instead used against her family and her people. Wracked with guilt, Wren left Mandalore and was branded a traitor by the Empire and her mother, Ursa Wren, leader of the clan. Wren worked as a bounty hunter alongside her friend Ketsu Onyo before being recruited by Captain Hera Syndulla and the Jedi Kanan Jarrus to join their rebel crew aboard the starship Ghost. Together, the crew fought against the Empire and used Wren's art as a symbol of hope. They became part of a larger rebel movement, with Wren's work continuing to inspire the fledgling rebellion.
            In 2 BBY, while hunting down the former Sith Lord and Mandalorian ruler Darth Maul, Wren discovered the Darksaber on Dathomir. She initially wanted nothing to do with it, but Jarrus and Fenn Rau, a Mandalorian Protector of Concord Dawn who joined the rebellion, convinced her to wield it so she could unite the Mandalorian people and bring them into the rebellion. Wren returned to her family and convinced them of the Empire's treachery, helping to kill Gar Saxon, the Imperial Viceroy of Mandalore, in the process. After aiding her family in the Mandalorian civil war, Sabine returned to aid the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Empire.
            A human female, Sabine Wren was born on the planet Krownest[1] in the waning years of the Galactic Republic, into Clan Wren of House Vizsla.[5] Her mother Ursa[12] was a member of Death Watch[5] during a time when Mandalore had fallen into chaos after the collapse of the New Mandalorian government, near the end of the Clone Wars.[13] Trained from an early age in Mandalorian warrior culture,[14] Wren forged her distinctive armor with her family,[5] but also inherited her Nite Owls[15] helmet from someone whose identity she was reluctant to reveal.[14] Her father, artist Alrich Wren, took Sabine to see the statue of Tarre Vizsla.[16]
            After the Clone Wars ended, the Galactic Empire established a presence on Mandalore and opened an Imperial Academy, which Wren attended as a Imperial cadet. As a youth, she believed in the Empire[17] and, even as it put her through some "rough stuff",[17] followed its orders blindly. During her time at the Academy, she studied the tactics of Twi'lek Resistance leader Cham Syndulla[18] and Mandalorian Protector leader Fenn Rau[5] during the Clone Wars. This would eventually put her at odds with the Imperial establishment there, and led to a nightmarish experience.[6]
            As a young and idealistic Imperial cadet, Sabine built an Arc Pulse Generator that she nicknamed the "Duchess", which reacted with the beskar alloy inside the Mandalorian armor, incinerating the armor and disintegrating their wearers. The weapon was regarded by many Mandalorians as an abomination because it turned their armor against them; Mandalorian armor held a sacrosanct place in Mandalorian culture since it was passed down from generation to generation.[10] As Wren witnessed the Empire subjugating Mandalore, she was wracked with guilt at her own role in helping the Empire build the weapon used to oppress her people.[11]
            When she spoke out against the Empire, Sabine's mother, her father, and her brother Tristan Wren sided with the Empire and cast her out. Estranged from her family,[11] Sabine Wren escaped the Imperial Academy with the help of her friend, Ketsu Onyo, and deserted the Empire.[19] Sabine's decision to renounce the Empire had serious ramifications for her family. Her father became a hostage of Viceroy Gar Saxon, the Emperor's Hand and the Imperial puppet ruler of Mandalore. Her mother Ursa was forced to prove her clan's loyalty to the Empire while her brother Tristan was forced to serve in Saxon's Imperial Super Commandos so that the family could remain in Saxon's favor.[11] Before fleeing Mandalore, Sabine also destroyed her weapon. However, the Empire was able to use her research to build another arc pulse generator.[10]
            During her escape from Mandalore, Wren received no small amount of help from Wookiees, for which Wren felt she owed them a debt.[20] Wren and Onyo then became bounty hunting partners; the two were like sisters, though Wren was the softer of the two. Together, they dreamed of joining the criminal organization Black Sun, all the while doing things just for money and caring only about themselves in an attempt to survive.[19] Ultimately, they parted on bad terms[15] due to Onyo getting "greedy" and leaving Wren for dead.[19]
            At some point, while on the run from an Imperial attempt to capture her after she had left the Academy, a man named Janard saved her life by knocking over a stack of freight containers to block the Imperials' path while she escaped.[17] Eventually, the brutal Imperial crackdown on her homeworld and the consequent loss of her family pushed Wren into open rebellion.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sabine_Wren</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSabineWren</string></dict>
        <key>Vima-Da-Boda</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.468.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vima-Da-Boda was a female Human Jedi Knight during the later years of the Galactic Republic, who survived the Great Jedi Purge and the downfall of the Empire. She spoke in the third person, referring to herself as "Vima."
            Vima Da-Boda was the great-great-great-granddaughter of Vima Sunrider, daughter of legendary Jedi Master of ancient times Nomi Sunrider,[1] and served the Force for over a century. She was trained by a male Jedi Master who gave her a lightsaber. The Force-sensitivity passed through Vima to her daughter, Neema, and Vima began to train her daughter in the ways of the Jedi. As with many young pupils, Neema grew frustrated by the slow pace of her Jedi education, and sought alternative training. Neema's impatience and lack of knowledge in the ways of the Force opened her to the dark side. The dark side consumed Neema, and she left her mother.
            Years later, Vima received a telepathic plea from her daughter, who had become the wife of an Ottethan warlord. Vima rushed to the dungeon to her daughter's aid, but was too late: Neema had been fed to the rancors of Ottethan. Giving in to her rage, Vima sliced the warlord in half with her lightsaber. Her desire for vengeance quenched, Vima realized she was succumbing to the dark side herself. Over time, her ability to sense and use the Force slowly faded away, although it is unclear if this was a result of her fall to the dark side or of another cause.
            With the onset of the Great Jedi Purge in 19 BBY, Vima went into hiding on Nar Shaddaa. Her weak connection to the Force coupled with Nar Shaddaa's dense population may have been the key to her survival of Order 66 and the subsequent Jedi eradication efforts.
            In 5 BBY Vima ran across Han Solo for the first time and spoke of his future, telling him of Mako Spince's betrayal, his joining a cause and becoming a General and his willingness to give up the smuggler's life for the woman he loved. He brushed her off then as being insane and forgot her by the next morning.
            At some point between 3 ABY and 9 ABY, Vima was imprisoned on Kessel for an unknown crime or reason. Vima discovered Kyp Durron, a young Human ripe with nascent Force potential. Even with her dulled connection to the Force, Vima could sense the raw, untapped power within Durron. Using what connection she had, Vima taught Durron what minor skills she could before being removed by Imperial authorities under unknown circumstances.
            By 10 ABY, Vima had made her way back to Nar Shaddaa. In that year, she sensed the Force presence of Leia Organa Solo. Detecting what she thought to be a Jedi, Vima explained the tale of her fall and bequeathed to Organa Solo a box containing a 10,000-year-old lightsaber discovered on Ossus nearly 900 years earlier.
            After the final death of Emperor Palpatine on Byss, Organa Solo returned to Nar Shaddaa to remove Vima and extract from her knowledge of the holocrons and the destroyed Jedi Order. Vima, having realized her errors decades earlier, felt unworthy of serving the power she sensed in Organa Solo and the unborn Anakin Solo, but was given little choice after an ambush by the bounty hunter Boba Fett. Han Solo and Chewbacca helped the group escape the clutches of Fett.
            En route to New Alderaan, the Millennium Falcon was forced to hide from Fett in the gas cloud home to Empatojayos Brand's Robida Colossus. Upon their arrival, Vima and Brand aided Skywalker in the training of Jem Ysanna, Rayf Ysanna, and Kam Solusar, the first of Skywalker's Jedi students. The wisdom imparted to Skywalker and his new students would be influential in his decision to found the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. Shortly thereafter, Vima used her healing skills to rid Skywalker of a poison injected into him by Dark Jedi agents.[3]
            After fleeing to Nespis VIII, Leia, who had been hesitant to tap into her Force potential, learned the ways of the Jedi from Vima, including how to shield the newly born Anakin. This skill allowed Organa Solo to save baby Anakin from being possessed by the spirit of Palpatine. Vima, having rekindled her light side spirit in aiding Organa Solo, Skywalker and the New Republic, claimed to be able to feel the flow of the Force once more.
            Little is known of the fate of Vima after the defeat of Palpatine on Onderon. For a period, she helped instruct new Jedi recruits at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, and in 13 ABY she warned Skywalker about Ennix Devian. By that time, she had ceased referring to herself in the third person.[4] But after this she seemed to have disappeared.[5]
            Vima-Da-Boda was voiced by Glynnis Talken in the Dark Empire and Dark Empire II audio dramas.
            The epilogue of Empire's End stated that Vima disappeared on Onderon in 11 ABY during the New Republic celebration over the defeat of Palpatine. However, both the third edition of A Guide to the Star Wars Universe and the appendix of The New Essential Guide to Characters said Vima served as an instructor at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 in her later years.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vima-Da-Boda</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemVimaDaBoda</string></dict>

Versé was recommended by Panaka to join Senator Padmé Amidala's new cohort of Handmaidens. She was a top-notch slicer and used her talents in Amidala's service in more ways than one.[4] In 22 BBY,[2] Versé was killed when the ship she had traveled to Coruscant on was destroyed by the bounty hunter Zam Wesell in an attempt to kill Amidala and prevent her from voting against the Military Creation Act.[3]
            Versé was portrayed by Avril Wynne in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.[5] As Wynne remained uncredited until 2019 and her face was mostly obscured throughout her sole scene in Attack of the Clones, author E. K. Johnston opted to substitute a new person as inspiration for the character's physical appearance when writing Queen's Shadow. Johnston sought to create a more racially diverse cast in Queen's Shadow than found in the films and based Versé's appearance on a tour guide she had at Rotorua, New Zealand. Johnston envisioned the character as stockier in build than her fellow Naboo Royal Handmaidens and portrayed by an actress of Māori descent.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vers%C3%A9</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemVerse</string></dict>

She was born on Alderaan and was one of the few Alderaanian youths mentored by Queen Breha Organa, which cultivated a deep respect for the House of Organa. Verlaine, a committed royalist, followed in the footsteps of her homeworld's leaders and became a member of the Rebel Alliance, serving as a pilot.
            After the Galactic Empire's deep space mobile battle station, the Death Star, destroyed Alderaan, Verlaine heard whispers that the Empire was hunting down surviving Alderaanians. Following the destruction of the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin, Verlaine pledged her loyalty to Princess Leia Organa. The two defied the orders of the Rebel leadership and set out on their own mission to find and protect surviving Alderaanians from the Empire. The two first made their way to the planet Naboo, where they took on a small group of Alderaanian citizens and had to inform them of their world's destruction, before heading for the planet Sullust.
            Evaan Verlaine was born on the planet Alderaan many years before the Battle of Yavin. At a young age, she was one of only a few Alderaanian youths to be mentored by Queen Breha Organa, the planet's ruling monarch. Through her time with the queen, Verlaine learned much about the culture and heritage of her homeworld and formed a life-long respect for both the queen and House of Organa. She became a committed royalist, believing in the Alderaanian monarchy, and followed in the footsteps of the planet's leaders by joining the Alliance to Restore the Republic. As a member of the Rebellion against the rule of the Galactic Empire, Verlaine became a Rebel pilot.[1]
            In 0 BBY, Verlaine participated in the Battle of Scarif as Gold Three from Gold Squadron as part of the Rebel support forces attacking the Shield Gate above Scarif.[4]
            Assisting in the space battle as the Alliance Fleet attacked the Shield Gate, Gold Squadron conducted several attack runs on the Shield Gate in an effort to weaken the shield. After several runs against the gate, the Squadron redirected their efforts against a couple of Star Destroyers.[5]
            In 0 BBY, she served in the Great Temple, the Rebel base on Yavin 4, when Alderaan was destroyed.[1] The destruction, known to Alderaanian survivors as "the Disaster,"[6] was carried out by the Death Star, the Empire's deep space mobile battle station,[7] and led to the death of Queen Organa and her husband, Viceroy Bail Organa,[1] one of the founders of the Rebel Alliance.[8] The Rebels gained a quick victory, however, when Princess Leia Organa,[7] the queen's adoptive daughter,[9] brought the stolen Death Star plans to Yavin 4. Once the plans were analyzed and a weakness in the station was discovered, a small fleet of Rebel starfighters launched the Battle of Yavin and destroyed the Death Star.[7] Verlaine participated in the battle[2] as Gold Three[4] of Gold Squadron, eight BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber led by Jon "Dutch" Vander.[2] As Verlaine attempted to make her way back to the Yavin moon, her Y-wing was targeted by the TIE fighter of Senior Lieutenant Iden Versio,[10] but the rebel pilot was able to successfully make her way back to the base,[1] unlike the rest of her squadron.[7]
            After the Battle of Yavin, only a small group of the initial task force returned. Luke Skywalker, the pilot who fired the shot that destroyed the Death Star; and Han Solo, a smuggler who helped Organa bring the Death Star plans to the Rebel base and aided Skywalker in the battle, both received medals in a ceremony held in the Great Temple. Verlaine was in attendance at the ceremony. After the medals were presented, Organa said a few words in remembrance of her parents and her homeworld. Her words were measured and lacked emotion, leading some of the assembled Rebels to refer to her as the "ice princess." When the ceremony ended, Verlaine remained behind and paid her respects to Queen Organa and Viceroy Organa at a memorial statue.[1]
            Because the Empire learned of the location of the Rebel base before the Battle of Yavin, Rebel General Jan Dodonna ordered the evacuation of the Great Temple. Verlaine and some of her fellow Rebels packed supplies in the base's hangar that would be loaded into the Rebel fleet that arrived at Yavin 4. While working, she and another Rebel discussed Organa's cold demeanor. The princess overheard them and approached, at which point the other Rebel quickly left, leaving Organa and Verlaine to talk on their own. Verlaine explained her loyalty to House of Organa and to the late queen, and she pledged her service to the princess, despite her initial reservations about how the princess was handling her duties in the aftermath of Alderaan's destruction. Verlaine also told Organa about rumors suggesting that the Empire was hunting down all surviving Alderaanians, rumors that Verlaine believed. Between Verlaine's concerns about Organa's leadership and the rumors, Organa decided to leave the Rebel base without a Rebel escort, in defiance of General Dodonna's orders, and find the surviving Alderaanians to protect them. Verlaine agreed to go with her in order to preserve their planet's culture.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Evaan_Verlaine</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemEvaanVerlaine</string></dict>
        <key>Mandalore the Avenger</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.473.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mandalore the Avenger, born Shae Vizla, was a female Human Mandalorian who gained notoriety during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. A ruthless bounty hunter, Vizla was often employed by the Sith Empire, who made use of her martial skills when undertaking the most risk-intensive missions. She assassinated Republic Senator Keenig, was part of the Imperial force attacking the planet of Alderaan, and launched a strike on a Republic political envoy, during which Vizla's brother was killed by the Jedi Master Aurei Eadon, causing her to develop an intense hatred for the Jedi Order. When the Empire launched an attack on the galactic capital of Coruscant, Vizla was contracted to disable the planet's defense grid, located within the Jedi Temple. In conjunction with a frontal assault by the Sith Lord Darth Malgus, Vizla infiltrated the Temple, proceeding to kill several members of the Temple Security Force. She successfully completed her mission to disable the defense grid, allowing Darth Angral's Sith armada to strike at Coruscant, and when the attack was over, utilized her jetpack to fly away from the Temple.
            During the Cold War Vizla retired from Imperial service and settled with her clan on Rishi, cooperating with the Nova Blades pirates to maintain civil relations in Raider's Cove. When the Nova Blades aligned with the Order of Revan, Vizla, nicknamed "Torch" by the locals, broke ties with them and settled on the Tracyn Island to stay clear of the Revanites. Approached by an individual looking for intel on Revanites, Vizla challenged the intruder in combat and only provided the information after she was defeated in a sparring match. Refusing to let her clan join the all-out war, Vizla nevertheless traveled to Yavin IV to join in a fight against reborn Revan himself.
            After the Eternal Empire of Zakuul invaded the galaxy and Mandalore the Vindicated was slain in battle, Vizla was chosen as the next Mandalore and reluctantly took up the title Mandalore the Avenger. She united some of the scattered clans and led them in their first victory against Zakuul in many months. Receiving an offer from Theron Shan, the new Mandalore assembled her people for a raid on Darvannis weapons factory to re-arm themselves. With her second-in-command Khomo Fett she met the Commander of the Alliance that opposed Zakuul, assigning him to work with scout Torian Cadera. Disabling the factory's shield, perimeter guns and other defenses, the Mandalorians moved inside the factory, with Vizla leading the assault. They were able to claim a large amount of weapons and deal sufficient damage to the factory before Vizla ordered an organized retreat. After the battle, the Mandalore assigned Torian Cadera to act as her representative and liaison within the Alliance, later joining it herself and making their partnership official.
            Shae Vizla was a female Human Mandalorian warrior who spent her youth during the time of the Great Galactic War. In her younger years, she was earning a living as a ruthless bounty hunter, taking high-profile jobs in the pursuit of money, without a care for her employers goals.[1] Following the return of the Sith Empire from their millennia-long era of seclusion, and the start of the Great Galactic War between the resurgent Sith and the Galactic Republic, the Sith Imperials formed an alliance with the Mandalorian warrior clans,[5] one that remained strong under the reign of Mandalore the Vindicated.[6] Vizla's brutal assassination of Senator Keenig caught the attention of Sith Lord Darth Malgus, beginning her a partnership with the Sith Empire.[7] Her exceptional skill[1] earned her a reputation that found Vizla commonly employed by the Imperials for heavy-risk operations of a large and important nature.[8] Vizla's skill and efficiency led her to join the Empire's biggest campaigns against the Republic.[9]
            In 3667 BBY, during the heat of the Great Galactic War, Shae Vizla took part in the Sith Empire's attack on the peaceful Core World of Alderaan.[10] Led by Darth Malgus, Imperial forces numbering hundreds of Sith warriors, several thousand assault droids,[11] and a multitude of Sith troopers strong, invaded the arboreal world.[12] Despite these odds, the Sith were held off by the combined forces of the Republic's special forces unit, Havoc Squad, and a cadre of Jedi Knights that included Satele Shan.[11] Shan personally engaged Malgus, defeating and wounding the Sith Lord, leaving him beneath the rubble of a shattered rock face.[12] However, Malgus escaped and returned to the war, and Shan theorized that it had been Vizla who was responsible for the Sith Lord's rescue.[10]
            Three years later, in 3664 BBY, Vizla was tasked with assaulting a Republic political envoy. During the course of the attack, Vizla's brother was slain by Jedi Master Aurei Eadon. The Mandalorian mercenary challenged Eadon to a duel, seeking to avenge her brother's death, but Eadon refused.[10] This event caused Vizla to develop an intense hatred for the Jedi, though she kept the reasons behind her bitter feelings to herself.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shae_Vizla</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMandaloretheAvenger</string></dict>

The singer, who was billed as Chanteuse of the Stars, was in high demand and frequently toured, which made it rare for her to settle in one place for too long. However, Dryden Vos was able to book her for an extended residency on his yacht by offering her a large sum of money. While performing on Vos' ship, she was paired with classic supper-club singer Luleo Primoc. Ventafoli used a multi-vocoder to boost her voice to non-human frequencies and performed in a corded auropyle dress.[3]

        <key>Verla</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.475.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Verla, a Force-sensitive human female, was an acolyte of Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr during the early years of the Galactic Empire. Unlike Barr's other disciples, Verla's connection to the Force made her a candidate for Jedi training. As a result, Barr assumed the role of Jedi Master by teaching Verla to control her powers. Verla was loyal to Barr and supported his plan to sow the seeds of rebellion against the rule of Emperor Palpatine. She and the other acolytes were with their Master when he maneuvered the Mon Calamari and the Empire into a conflict that would lead to the Imperial occupation of Mon Cala.
            As the oceanic world fell to Imperial forces, Barr and his acolytes were hunted by the Emperor's Jedi hunters, known as the Inquisitorius, led by the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Verla and her Master were confronted by the Inquisitors in Bel City, but the Jedi successfully manipulated the clone Purge Troopers to execute Order 66 against the Inquisitorius, all of whom once served the Jedi Order prior to the fall of the Galactic Republic. After escaping the Inquisitors, Barr ordered Verla to leave the planet and survive while he remained behind to personally confront Vader in single combat. It was Barr's hope that Verla would complete her training under another Jedi Purge survivor.
            In the aftermath of the Clone Wars, Verla encountered Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr. A survivor of the initial Jedi Purge, Barr sought to avenge the Jedi Order by fomenting a rebellion against the Sith-controlled Galactic Empire. To that end, he recruited several acolytes to his cause, including Verla. Unlike her fellow disciples, Verla demonstrated an ability to wield the Force. Recognizing her potential, Barr took it upon himself to train Verla in the ways of the Force as her de facto Jedi Master.[2]
            In 18 BBY,[3] a year after the accession of Emperor Palpatine,[4] Verla was hiding on the oceanic planet Mon Cala with Bar and the other acolytes. During the Battle of Dac City, Barr was informed by King Lee-Char that Darth Vader and the Inquisitorius had arrived to hunt the Jedi. Verla's Master revealed to his students that Vader was, in fact, Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Knight and the Chosen One destined to bring balance to the Force.[1] Having succeeded in starting a war between the Mon Calamari and the Empire, Barr and his students evacuated their refuge only to be confronted moments later by the Sith Lord and his Jedi hunters.[5]
            Three acolytes were killed during the ensuing pursuit; another two elected to remain behind in order to provide Barr and Verla more time to escape the planet. However, the Padawan and his last acolyte were cornered by the Inquisitorius in Bel City. Verla watched in amazement as her Master used the Force to compel the Purge Troopers—the last batch of clones who were activated after the purge—to execute Order 66 on the Inquisitorius, all of whom were once affiliated with the Jedi Order.[5] As chaos between the Inquisitors and their troopers ensued, Verla and Barr escaped from the assassins. Shortly afterward, Verla's Master ordered her to leave Mon Cala after the fighting was over and to seek out another Jedi Master. It was Barr's hope that Verla would complete her trials under the tutelage of a fully-trained Jedi, such as Quinlan Vos, Obi-Wan Kenobi, or even Grand Master Yoda. Barr confronted Vader in person, but was slain in a lightsaber duel against the Dark Lord of the Sith. After her Master's death, Verla escaped from Bel City and was hiding in a dark cave with two Quarren soldiers by the time of Mon Cala's fall to the Empire.[2]
            Verla was a human female with blonde hair and light skin.[1] Like her fellow acolytes, she was loyal to Ferren Barr and his cause to liberate the galaxy from the rule of the Galactic Empire. She was an obedient apprentice who obeyed her Master without question;[2] when the Inquisitors threatened Barr's life, Verla was ready to die fighting alongside the Jedi.[5] When Barr succeeded in turning clones against the Inquisitorius, Verla expressed amazement at her Master's ability to use Order 66 to their advantage.[2]
            As a Force-sensitive, Verla possessed the ability to wield the power of the Force. Barr, who offered to teach Verla how to control her powers, passed on his limited Jedi training as a Padawan to Verla, who became his apprentice in the ways of the Force. Even before her training began, Verla was able to levitate a small object as a demonstration of her talent. By the time she confronted the Inquisitorius, Verla had gained enough knowledge to enhance her physical abilities, allowing her to leap over the Jedi hunters with the aid of the Force and her Master.[2]
            Verla first appeared in the canon 2018 comic Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 14: Burning Seas, Part II written by Charles Soule and penciled by Giuseppe Camuncoli.[1] In issue 15, Verla's hair is a different color.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Verla</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemVerla</string></dict>

        <key>Wenda</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.477.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wenda was a human woman with long, black hair and a cybernetic implant in her left eye. Wenda and her friend Bett were pirates who led a criminal gang. A year after the Battle of Jakku, Wenda and Brett met with the former stormtroopers Corlac and Terex. Corlac convinced Terex that Wenda and Bett shared his plan to rebuild the Old Empire. They managed to persuade Terex to help them access the former Imperial Shipyards above Rothana. In secret, Wenda along with Corlac and Bett planned to kill Terex once he had out lived his usefulness. Terex however learned of their plot and killed them by blowing up the master control station using the corvette Carrion Spike's weapons.
            Wenda lived during both the Imperial Era and New Republic Era. She and the humanoid woman Bett ran a ship repair and salvage operation on the planet Kaddak. Wenda and Bett were also the leaders of a criminal gang that became known as the Ranc gang. Wenda and Bett were old associates of Corlac, who served as an Imperial stormtrooper during the Battle of Jakku. A year after the Battle of Jakku, Corlac traveled to Kaddak with his old comrade Terex to re-establish contact with his old associates.[2]
            In 7 ABY, Corlac brought Terex to a meeting at a cantina with Wenda and Bett. Corlac managed to convince Terex that Wenda and Bett could help them rebuild the "Old Empire" if Terex helped them to gain access to the Rothana Imperial Shipyards. Wenda and Bett listened as Corlac recounted how Terex used to work at the Rothana shipyards before being dispatched as a stormtrooper to Jakku. Corlac claimed that Wenda and Bett had agreed to help them in exchange for any ships or parts they could not use. Terex was convinced by Corlac's arguments and agreed to help the criminal bosses gain access to the shipyard.[2] In truth, Corlac had no intention of rebuilding the Empire and had connived with Wenda and Bett to build a pirate fleet.[1]
            Later, Wenda and Bett along with their underlings including Wisper and Zumgi waited as Terex unlocked the shipyard's external doors. Wenda praised Terex for his work and instructed Wisper to take his team back to the shuttle and secure the shipyard. She warned him to be careful in case there were still security staff lingering around.[2]
            After their gang had secure the shipyard, Wenda and Bett met with Corlac in the control station to discuss their progress. When Corlac opined that Terex would become a problem for their plans, Wenda replied that they would deal with it when they got there and warned them not to hasten things until Terex had finished fixing Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's ship Carrion Spike. When Bett asked what was so important about that ship, Corlac explained that the Carrion Spike was equipped with a cloaking device and advanced surveillance systems. Corlac then advocated killing Terex because he had become an obstacle to their criminal enterprise.[1]
            However, Terex had repaired the Carrion Spike's surveillance systems and learned of Corlac's plot. He then used the ship's weapons systems to obliterate the control station, killing Wenda, Bett, and Corlac. Terex then took control of the Ranc gang before joining the First Order who sought to overthrow the New Republic.[1]
            Wenda was a human woman with long black hair, fair skin, and a cybernetic left eye. She wore a purple vest over a white shirt and brown trousers. Wenda and Bett owned a large ship repair and salvage operation which doubled as a criminal gang. She was an associate of Corlac[2] and shared his dream of creating a fleet of pirate starships using the resources of the Rothana Imperial Shipyards.[1]
            Wenda first appeared in the 2016 comic Poe Dameron 9: The Gathering Storm, Part II, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Phil Noto.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wenda</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemWenda</string></dict>

        <key>Besany Wennen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.479.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Besany Wennen was an agent of the Republic Treasury Audit Division.
            She posed as a GAR Logistics worker on Coruscant in 21 BBY, in order to investigate Vinna Jiss, who was under suspicion of misappropriating supplies. While undercover, she developed a friendship with Corr, a clone trooper who lost his hands while disarming a bomb and was transferred to a civilian post until he received higher-quality prosthetics that would allow him to return to the front. Corr's prosthetic hands caused her to feel sorry for the clone troopers; she felt that the government used the clones as a "slave army." After Jiss was covertly eliminated, she helped in Kal Skirata's classified mission to uncover terrorists in Coruscant's The Works. By the end of Skirata's mission, she and the Null ARC trooper Ordo began showing interest in each other.
            In 21 BBY Skirata asked her to acquire some information from the Republic and had Mereel supply her with a small Merr-Sonn blaster for her protection. She was able to acquire the information and began investigating further but was warned by an unknown Gurlanin that she was being watched and should not dig any deeper.[1] When RC-8015 (Fi) was injured on Gaftikar Kal Skirata asked Wennen to keep an eye on him while he was being treated in a private hospital. When she arrived the medical droid had diagnosed him as brain dead and was about to euthanize him. She drew her blaster and locked herself in the room with Fi. CSF officer Jaller Obrim arrived shortly after and took her and Fi to safety. Besany joined Kal Skirata's team, regularly supplying them with Treasury information, and looking after Darman Skirata's son, young Venku Skirata.
            One day on her way home, she saw a man stalking her in the transparisteel walls of Galos Mall. Certain that he was a Republic Intel agent, the Chancellors "Hands", she tried to shake him off. However, she made a mistake and instead of sticking with the crowds, she inadvertently walked into a deserted location of the city. As she was about to confront the agent, another man following him grabbed him from behind, who turned out to be Captain Ordo. Following that incident, Ordo proposed to her in her apartment in the middle of supper, offering her a multi-million credit Sharoni sapphire pin since he didn't have a ring. She accepted the proposal. She later had a section of the sapphire put into a wedding ring, and the rest of the sapphire was sold to add to Kal Skirata's Clone research funding. Also after this she left her apartment and moved into the slums, into Laseema's apartment, the secret Skirata safehouse.
            Skirata assigned 2 of his Null adopted sons, Mereel and Jaing Skirata as "fundraisers" for his research into stopping the clone rapid aging, to give his boys a natural life. Agent Besany Wennen, or now Ordo Skirata's new wife, had previously given Kal and the Nulls her access into the national Republic Treasury access codes, so they could research where new clones were coming from to get new cloning research material and to see where the war was going. Upon Jaing's data-mining worm virus being discovered, the Republic Treasury launched a full investigation. The Republic special investigators brought in were Mereel and Jaing, there involvement in the actions that caused the investigations unknown to the GAR. Jaing and Mereel's investigations revealed no results, as they had erased their and Besany's tracks in the system as they went along, and that they would have to check Army databases in addition to treasury databases to see how far this "mystery program" went. The Republic agreed to give the nulls full access to all GAR records. While the null investigation found nothing, the droid investigation revealed questionable access made by one of Besany's co-workers, Jilka Zan Zentis, investigation a government shell company on Besany's request. Besany felt awful that her friend Jilka was imprisoned because of her. Later a Gurlanin spy told Besany that Jilka was framed, and the actions made on Jilka's terminal were made obvious by the Gurlanins so the GAR wouldn't see any of Besany or Skirata's sons actions. Besany was so upset her friend was going to prison in her place, but Ordo and Skirata didn't understand why. Skirata ordered Jilka to be broken out of jail, her prison transport hijacked by Ordo and Wad'e Tay'haai.
            Besany evacuated Coruscant and moved to Mandalore with the Skirata clan. Much later, when Kal Skirata was forced to abandon Darman and Niner on Coruscant directly after Etain Tur-Mukan was killed, she was instrumental in helping Kal overcome his grief. She related to Kal often on the subject of remembering their fathers, and how Kal was her new father.[3]
            She wanted Jilka Zan Zentis to have a lover, specifically RC-5108/8843.
            She wondered why Ordo slept with his head under his blanket, Kal Skirata said it was because on Kamino the clones were subjected to exercises involving live explosives.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Besany_Wennen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBesanyWennen</string></dict>

        <key>Tes Vevec</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.482.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tes Vevec was a female Mandalorian mercenary who lived during the Second Imperial Civil War. When her father was killed during the Battle of Botajef, Vevec was told by the newly-risen Mand'alor, Yaga Auchs, that her ex-husband Hondo Karr had become a traitor to the Mandalorians and was the one responsible for murdering her father. Vevec tracked Karr—who had joined up with the Galactic Empire on Botajef, only to defect to the Galactic Alliance Remnant at later point in time—intent on avenging her father. She eventually located Karr on Da Soocha's moon, Napdu, and confronted him with the intent to kill. Karr managed to survive Vevec's assault long enough to subdue his ex-wife and force her to hear the truth: Yaga Auchs was the traitor, and her father had died to save Karr's life. Once convinced of his innocence, Vevec was able to come to terms with Karr, and the two departed Napdu together to seek the truth behind Auch's betrayal and exact justice on the treacherous Mand'alor.
            Tes Vevec was a Mandalorian bounty hunter and the ex-wife of Hondo Karr. Her father, the Mandalorian warrior Vevec, was killed at the Battle of Botajef. Following the death of her father, Tes dedicated her life to hunting down her ex-husband, whom she wrongly believed to be responsible. She was deceived by the current Mandalore, Yaga Auchs, who claimed that Hondo was a traitor to the Mandalorian people.[1]
            In 137 ABY, she tracked down Hondo on Napdu, where he was on a mission for Rogue Squadron and the Galactic Alliance Remnant. The two engaged in a brawl, but eventually Karr was able to disarm her and reveal her the true story of the events surrounding Botajef. Reunited, Tes and Hondo came to an agreement to work together and find proof of Yaga Auchs's treachery.[1]
            Vevec wore Mandalorian armor colored primarily orange[1]—the color Mandalorians traditionally associated with a lust for life, or shereshoy, in their culture[2]—with silver shoulder plates, yellow armor plates on her biceps, and a purple painted trim around her helmet's multi-tiered, red-tinted visor. She wore a utility belt with several pouches around her waist, from which hung a maroon-colored kama and the holster for her blaster pistol.

        <key>Sia-Lan Wezz</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.483.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sia-Lan Wezz was a female Human Jedi Knight and General in the waning years of the Galactic Republic, the former Padawan of Master Lo-Jad.
            Discovered to be Force-sensitive during infancy, Sia-Lan Wezz was taken to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for formal training in the ways of the Force at the Temple's academy. After years of training, Wezz was selected by Jedi Master Lo-Jad as a Padawan and was destined to travel the galaxy with him to continue her studies down the Jedi Path. A year after her thirteenth birthday, Wezz was assigned to investigate the Coruscant-based terrorist organization known as the Flail. Teaming with a Wookiee, Wezz was forced to engage members of the group and went on to complete her mission.[4] In 32 BBY, Master Lo-Jad assigned Wezz to Naboo where she was to study for a semester at the Royal House of Learning in Theed. Becoming close with headmaster Lucos Dannt, Wezz was on planet when the Trade Federation blockaded the planet. During the invasion, Wezz joined the Naboo Underground, a resistance movement that attempted to topple Federation control. During her time in the resistance, Wezz became well acquainted with the likes of Deel Surool, Rorworr, and fellow Padawan Rann I-Kanu. While Wezz would leave Naboo shortly after the Federation was defeated, she kept in touch with her new comrades and would involve them in several missions in her future career.[1]
            During her time as a Padawan, Wezz either crafted several lightsabers or possessed several lightsaber crystals as she was seen with blue, pink, yellow, and green-bladed weapons throughout her service to the Order. Following the election of Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor, Wezz was assigned a mission to the snow-covered world of Puloorn with her comrades Rorworr, Vor'en Kurn, and Deel Surool to uncover a hidden Sith Temple. The team found the temple ruins, possibly inhabited by dark side beasts or cultists, and reported the findings to Palpatine and the Jedi High Council. Over the course of the next decade, Wezz would study and prepare for her Trials of Knighthood, a series of tests she would pass before being elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight.[5]
            Just before the start of the Clone Wars, Wezz and her comrades journeyed to Corellia where the four foiled a Separatist assassination attempt on a Corulag Senator, Alastar Treen.[6] Following this, the four frequently worked together. The team faced a variety of opponents and situations, such as attacks on battle droid commanders, the investigation of a bounty hunter operating out of the Royal Hutt Hotel, assaults on crime bosses, encounters with Tusken Raiders on Tatooine, cantina brawls with Aqualish[7] and Rodian gangs,[6] an escape from a battle droid garrison,[6] an escape from a Colicoid-run prison in the Spice Mines of Kessel,[8] a Jawa ambush in an abandoned armory, and even mounted blasters in the darkened corridors of the warlord Grumbog's space station fortress.[6]
            The team was so successful that they continued to receive orders directly from the office of the Chancellor and the High Council. One such mission had the group investigating the disappearance of a Republic arsenal ship that had been tasked with decommissioning the Trade Federation Army defeated at Naboo. The investigation led the team to Kwenn Space Station, where they defeated several re-activated battle droids.[7] Another mission to which the team was assigned involved preventing Corann from being the first of the Core Worlds to withdraw from the Republic. Rorworr's team investigated rumors of Separatist activity on the small industrial planet and discovered a droid manufacturing plant.[6]
            An accomplished Guardian by the end of the war, Wezz was able to avoid the execution of Contingency Order 66 at the end of the war; an order issued by the treasonous Chancellor Palpatine ordering the death of all Jedi. Fleeing from the Grand Army, Wezz came into contact with fellow survivor Master Shadday Potkin and agreed to meet her on Kessel. A month after the birth of the Galactic Empire, Wezz met with Jedi Potkin, Ma'kis'shaalas, Roblio Darté, Tsui Choi, Bultar Swan, Koffi Arana, and Jastus Farr to discuss their next move against Palpatine, who was indeed a Sith Lord. Unbeknownst to all present, Potkin had arrogantly lured Darth Vader to the meeting in hopes that the team could overwhelm the Sith and end the Empire. Sia-Lan Wezz was the first to attack Vader, charging toward him with her lightsaber poised high. She was no match for the Dark Lord of the Sith though, who easily extended his lightsaber through her chest, and sliced off her hand before her dead body hit the floor.[2]
            During the Galactic Civil War, Sia-Lan Wezz and fellow Jedi Dorn Tavers were portrayed on a Rebel Alliance poster under the slogan "Remember Alderaan."[9] Reports erroneously indicated that Wezz was killed by High Inquisitor Volytar during the Battle of Skorrupon, defending Skorrupon's people from being taken over by Imperial forces.[10]
            Sia-Lan Wezz is the iconic Jedi Guardian for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game, the character used for every game example within the rulebooks.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sia-Lan_Wezz</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSiaLanWezz</string></dict>
        <key>Tahiri Veila</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.484.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tahiri Veila, a Force-sensitive Human female, was a Jedi Knight of the New Jedi Order. During the Second Galactic Civil War, Veila became the Sith apprentice of Darth Caedus, the Dark Lord of the Sith who seduced her to the dark side of the Force. The granddaughter of a Jedi of the Old Order, Veila was born on the planet Tatooine to a pair of moisture farmers, Tryst and Cassa Veila. After the deaths of her parents, an orphaned Veila was adopted by the leader of a Tusken Raider tribe who raised her as one of the Sand People. Around 22 ABY, Jedi Master Tionne Solusar discovered Veila's connection to the Force and brought her to the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. She then formed a friendship with a fellow Jedi Initiate named Anakin Solo, a grandson of the Jedi Chosen One Anakin Skywalker who was also remembered as the Sith Lord Darth Vader.
            In the second year of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Veila was captured by the invaders during the attack on the Jedi Praxeum. She was then "shaped" by Mezhan Kwaad and Nen Yim to be a Jedi/Yuuzhan Vong hybrid. After her rescue, Veila became an asset to the Jedi as the procedure gave her the ability to speak and understand the enemy's language. In 27 ABY, Veila participated in the ill-fated Mission to Myrkr to remove the threat of the Jedi-hunting voxyn and witnessed the death of Anakin Solo, whom she had begun to think of as more than a friend. Due to the emotional pain caused by his death, her Vong-implanted personality Riina Kwaad resurfaced and attempted to control Veila's mind.
            After successfully unifying both personalities, Veila traveled to Zonama Sekot with Corran Horn and the Yuuzhan Vong Nen Yim, Harrar and a disguised Nom Anor. She aided Nen Yim in discovering the relation between the Yuuzhan Vong and Zonama Sekot, which proved vital in ending the war and forging a peace with the Yuuzhan Vong. There on Zonama Sekot, she learned that the Yuuzhan Vong personality imprinted upon her by shaper Mezhan Kwaad, was in fact the personality of Nen Yim, complete with memories. At that point she came to peace with the surprising truth just before Nen Yim's death by Nom Anor. Veila fought in the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar and by the war's end, she stayed on Zonama Sekot with Danni Quee and Tekli to assist the Yuuzhan Vong with adjusting to peace.
            During the Dark Nest Crisis, Veila was banished to Dagobah for revealing Jedi confidential information, but later became an active member of the Jedi Order again by 40 ABY. Ultimately, she severed her ties to the Jedi during the Second Galactic Civil War and joined Darth Caedus—formerly known as the Jedi Jacen Solo—the older brother of Anakin Solo. Veila was seduced by the dark side of the Force through Caedus' promises of revisiting the late Solo from the past via an ancient technique called Flow-walking. After assassinating Imperial Head of State Gilad Pellaeon—by order of Darth Caedus—at the Second Battle of Fondor, Veila became the official apprentice to the Dark Lord of the Sith. She later renounced the Sith Order as well, shortly before Caedus' death during the Battle of Shedu Maad in 41 ABY.
            Over the next three years, Veila lived as a virtual outcast, having renounced her allegiance to the Jedi, the Sith and the Galactic Alliance. During her time as a bounty hunter in 43 ABY, she assisted the Jedi Order against the machinations of Chief of State Natasi Daala, the Alliance's anti-Jedi leader who plotted against the Order by taking advantage of a Force psychosis phenomenon that plagued some of the Jedi such as Seff Hellin. Veila was later placed on trial for the assassination of Gilad Pellaeon, but then escaped in 44 ABY. She then turned to Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo for a short time. Later she became the Imperial Hand of Pellaeon's successor, Jagged Fel after being turned over to him by the Solos. Her service to the Empire was brief, ultimately leading to her return to the ranks of the Jedi Order during their conflict with the Lost Tribe of Sith and the Force entity known as Abeloth.
            Tahiri was born on the planet Tatooine.[1] Like many of the planet's other settlers, her parents Cassa and Tryst Veila had a moisture farm where she spent her early years. She was orphaned at the age of three during a Tusken Raider raid though she was adopted by the tribe's leader Sliven in return for the kindness shown to him by her parents.[13] Tahiri was raised as a Tusken Raider and had a pet bantha named Bangor. She was skilled in the Force and was later found by Jedi Master Tionne and brought to Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 at about nine standard years old in 22 ABY.[1]
            There she met the youngest of the Solo children, Anakin, and they quickly became close friends. Around the Academy, Tahiri refused to wear shoes and would go everywhere barefoot because she liked the coolness of the floors, which contrasted pleasantly with Tatooine's hot sands.[1]
            On one adventure with Anakin, they came across the crumbling Palace of the Woolamander and discovered the Golden Globe and the ancient Kushiban Jedi Master Ikrit. Later, Ikrit also informed the pair that the Golden Globe contained countless trapped souls and that he had tried to break it before and failed.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tahiri_Veila</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTahiriVeila</string></dict>

She was sent to Tatooine to retrieve the holocron of Darth Nihilus, all the while attempting to beat the Jedi Knight Nariel Pridence to the punch.
            In 3643 BBY, Zare came to the planet Tatooine in search of the holocron of Darth Nihilus, which was in the possession of the gangster Diago Hixan. Zare sought to make contact with Diago by sending Geonosians to raid his spice warehouse on the edge of the Jundland. At the same time, a smuggler captain seeking a sensor computer from Diago, investigated on behalf of Diago's lieutenant, Tookreek, to claim a krayt dragon bone. Zare attempted to persuade the smuggler to arrange a meeting with Diago, but was refused, forcing her to disarm her opponent. She spared the smuggler, leaving with a reminder that her offer was still open.
            Zare later sent Imperial commandos to attack Diago's summer palace, where the smuggler was meeting with Tookreek. After the smuggler fended off the attack, Zare contacted them via holo, restating her offer, but again was refused, forcing her to order a renewed attack, but the smuggler survived that too.
            Zare eventually tracked the smuggler to Diago's oasis, called the Lightspring, where Jedi Knight Nariel Pridence was waiting. Additionally, Diago's delirium compelled to order his droids to kill on sight, resulting in an all out brawl between all four parties. Zare was killed in the fighting, along with Diago.
            If "Ace" is a male and side with Zare against Pridence, he can become intimate with her.[1] A smuggler who chose to side with Zare would later receive a message from her. In the message, Zare told the player that she took on the title "Darth Alluress" after retrieving the holocron. A neutral option of ignoring both can be chosen, that results in Zare's victory as well</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vaverone_Zare</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemVaveroneZare</string></dict>

        <key>Shara Bey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.488.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shara Bey was a human female pilot who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Lieutenant Bey and her husband, Sergeant Kes Dameron, had a son, Poe, whom they rarely saw during the war—a war they joined because they believed the galaxy was suffering under the rule of the Galactic Empire. Bey, a highly decorated A-wing pilot and a veteran of numerous battles, flew with Green Squadron in the assault against the second Death Star during the Battle of Endor.
            Though she had hoped Endor would mark the end of the war, Bey continued flying for the Alliance in the many engagements that followed the Death Star's destruction. She led the defense of the planet Naboo when it was targeted by the Empire during Operation: Cinder, flying with Princess Leia Organa and Naboo's queen, Sosha Soruna, to save the planet. Three months later, Bey assisted Commander Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi Knight, in retrieving two fragments of a Great Tree from the Empire on Vetine. She retired from the Alliance shortly thereafter.
            Bey and her family settled in a colony on Yavin 4, where she continued to fly her A-wing as part of the moon's civilian defense. Bey, who taught her young son how to fly, died six years after the Battle of Endor. Poe followed in his late mother's footsteps and flew for the New Republic before defecting to Organa's Resistance to fight against the growing threat of the First Order.
            Shara Bey was born some time prior to the Galactic Civil War,[5] which began in 0 BBY,[6] and grew up during the reign of the Galactic Empire.[5] She and her husband, Kes Dameron, saw that the galaxy was suffering under Imperial rule and felt the call to serve. As a result, they joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic[4] prior to the Battle of Hoth,[3] which was fought in 3 ABY.[6] Bey became a lieutenant in the Alliance Fleet and flew an A-wing, while Dameron was a sergeant and a ground soldier.[2] Together, they had a son, Poe Dameron, who was born two years after the Battle of Yavin,[1] one of the Alliance's most decisive early victories.[7] Poe lived with Bey's father while the war raged on, and neither Bey nor Dameron saw their son as much as they wanted to.[8]
            Bey became a distinguished Rebel pilot during the war, and her actions during the liberation of Gorma earned her the Bronze Nova for Conspicuous Gallantry. Less than one week later, she earned her triple ace while raiding an Imperial fuel depot at Beroq 4, during Operation: Mynock Bite. Bey fought in dozens more engagements during the war, and her fellow pilots, many of whom credited Bey with saving their lives, spoke highly of her.[4]
            Four years after the Battle of Yavin,[9] the Alliance learned that the Empire was building a superweapon, a second Death Star, in orbit of the Forest Moon of Endor. The Alliance Fleet assembled and launched a massive attack against the battle station.[10] Bey flew with Green Squadron during the assault against the Death Star, while Dameron served on the ground as one of the Pathfinders, an Alliance Special Forces unit under the command of General Han Solo, to destroy the shield generator protecting the Death Star. After the Pathfinders destroyed the generator, Bey and her fellow Green Squadron pilots defended the Millennium Falcon, piloted by General Lando Calrissian, as it entered the Death Star's super structure for the final attack. Calrissian and his fellow pilots destroyed the Death Star's main reactor, setting off a fatal chain reaction inside the station. Imperial ships began to flee in order to escape certain death, including an Imperial shuttle. Bey followed the shuttle to destroy it, but she was soon contacted by its pilot, Rebel Commander and Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, who had been aboard the Death Star[2]—and whose actions led to the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and his apprentice, Darth Vader.[10] Bey allowed Skywalker to pass unharmed, and the Death Star exploded only moments later.[2]
            When the battle came to a close, Imperial forces were left in chaos and, for the most part, retreated from Endor. Bey returned to Home One, the Rebel command ship, and reunited with those fellow pilots who survived. She received permission from Lieutenant L'ulo L'ampar, acting head of Green Squadron after Green Leader[2] Arvel Crynyd[11] was killed during the battle,[10] to join her fellow Rebels on Endor, where they were celebrating their victory in the home of the native Ewoks who helped the Pathfinders destroy the shield generator. Upon her arrival, she searched the Ewok village for her husband, hoping to find that he had survived the attack. Bey encountered Generals Solo and Calrissian, and she asked Solo where she could find the Pathfinders and received a compliment on her flying from Calrissian. She soon found Dameron, alive and well, and the two went for a walk in the village to talk about their future. It was their hope that the war had come to a close and they would finally be able to resume their life together.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shara_Bey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemSharaBey</string></dict>

            Rav Bralor was one of seventy-five Mandalorian Cuy'val Dar training sergeants for the Grand Army of the Republic's clone commandos, personally recruited by Jango Fett. After the completion of the duties of the Cuy'val Dar, she presumably returned to Mandalore. Midway through the Clone Wars she was asked by Sergeant Kal Skirata to maintain Kyrimorut, his future home and bastion of the Skirata clan, in the northern forests of Mandalore. Skirata returned to Mandalore 480 days after the First Battle of Geonosis with a very pregnant Etain Tur-Mukan after deciding that Mandalore was the safest place for Tur-Mukan, a Jedi General, to give birth in secret. Bralor had the home ready for them and helped them settle into their surroundings.
            Bralor and her niece Parja were present for the birth of Venku Skirata and for the arrival of Fi Skirata after he suffered brain trauma at the Battle of Gaftikar. Bralor trained a full company of Republic commandos, including Vevut Squad and Yayax Squad. The Commandos of Yayax deserted the Grand Army of the Republic after Order 66 and came to Mandalore to live with Bralor and the Skirata clan. Later she was present when the body of Tur-Mukan was brought to Mandalore and prepared Tur-Mukan's body for cremation.
            Bralor was described by Etain Tur-Mukan as 'frighteningly fit' and was a competent soldier with a strong dislike of Kaminoans and little patience for dithering from commanding officers. She and Kal Skirata were close friends and comrades-in-arms long before their service as Cuy'val Dar.
            Bralor's figurine bears a strong resemblance to illustrations of Vhonte Tervho.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rav_Bralor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRavBralor</string></dict>

She was a talented engineer and loved to fix things, from a broken chrono to a sick Nuna chick. She owned a successful workshop on Mandalore and was eventually responsible for the maintenance of all the machinery at Kyrimorut, the Skirata clan's home.
            When clone commando Fi Skirata was brought to Mandalore following brain damage sustained at the battle of Gaftikar, she took on the job of nursing Fi back to health - caring for him, giving him physical therapy, and eventually falling in love with him. Parja was endlessly patient with Fi's loss of memory and coordination and was fiercely protective of him even after he regained some mobility and speech. Fi and Parja were married in a traditional Mandalorian wedding ceremony 998 days after the battle of Geonosis with Parja wearing her workshop overalls and Fi wearing Mandalorian armor. The wedding - which took less than a minute - occurred right before Fi, now mostly recovered, left on a mission to Coruscant with ARC trooper deserters Sull, Spar and former Jedi General Bardan Jusik.
            When Clan Skirata deserted from the Grand Army of the Republic after Order 66, she lived there with them in Kyrimorut.
            Parja wore armor of a deep scarlet color. Her chestnut braids were often tied with copper beads.
            Her name is derived from the Mandalorian word "parjiir" meaning "victory".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Parja_Bralor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemParjaBralor</string></dict>
        <key>Lanoree Brock</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.492.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lanoree Brock was a Human female Je'daii Ranger that lived during the Force Wars; the sister of Dalien Brock.
            Lanoree Brock was a Force-sensitive Human female and the daughter of two Je'daii Masters. Growing up around the Temple of Arts, called Bodhi, on Tython with her younger brother Dalien, Brock developed a protective bond with her brother and the two studied together at Padawan Kesh before setting out on their Great Journey together.[1]
            Brock's Great Journey began when she was teenaged. With her brother Dalien, Brock traveled to Qigong Kesh, the Temple of Force Skills, surviving encounters with hook hawks and silik lizards along the way. There, they trained under Master Ter'cay, who took them to the Silent Desert, using Force telepathy to communicate with Brock. During this time, Brock found that Dalien was unable to hear Ter'cay in the Force. While at Qigong Kesh, Brock expanded her knowledge of the Force, learning suggestion, telepathy, and control.[1]
            After studying at Qigong Kesh, Lanoree and Dalien traveled to Stav Kesh, the Temple of Martial Arts. En route, they were attacked by a flame tygah. Though Brock intended to let her brother defeat the creature himself to avoid showing him his inadequacy, she was forced to intervene when Dalien's blaster misfired, and she used the Force to drive off the beast. At Stav Kesh, the two trained with Master Tave, first learning about breathing and its importance to fighting. Throughout their training, Lanoree tried to keep Dalien from fleeing the Force, refusing to believe he had successfully landed a strike on Tave due to his own skill.[1]
            In one incident, when Master Kin'ade led a training session that required the Journeyers to fight while deprived of their physical senses against a Darrow sphere, Dalien ended up shooting wildly with his blaster, injuring Brock and possibly other Journeyers, before he was knocked unconscious by Kin'ade. After the incident, Kin'ade, Lanoree, and Dalien were all asked to give their accounts of the event to Temple Master Lha-Mi. On their last day at Stav Kesh, a group of Journeyers, including the Brocks, were asked to fight one other. Lanoree found herself holding back and not using the Force against Dalien, but ultimately knocked him back with a Force punch, ending the fight. Before their departure, Lha-Mi warned Lanoree to be wary of her brother, saying that Dalien was growing increasingly unstable and dangerous.[1]
            Lanoree and Dalien then traveled to Anil Kesh, the Temple of Science. Along the way, they crossed the Moon Channel unescorted, working together to survive attacks by a gelfish swarm and a sea serpent. Upon arrival, Lanoree felt sick due to the Force Storms caused by the Chasm, which lay beneath the temple. At Anil Kesh, she found her calling in science and alchemy, and learned from Master Dam-Powl, who said she had the opportunity to be her greatest pupil. In the process of immersing herself in her studies, Brock began to put herself before her brother, and she began to learn the alchemy of flesh from Dam-Powl.[1]
            During their stay at Anil Kesh, Dalien and Lanoree were separated for four days, while Dalien went to the Riftlands with Master Quan-Jang. However, Dalien fled into the Abyss of Ruh. Master Quan-Jang and other Je'daii successfully captured Dalien and returned him to Anil Kesh, where he met Lanoree and another Journeyer, Skott Yun. Yun attempted to arrest Dalien, but Dalien killed Yun and escaped. Brock pursued her brother alone across the Red Desert and into the Old City, but heard her brother scream and found only his bloodied, shredded clothes, leading her and the Je'daii to believe Dalien had been killed.[1]
            Ultimately, Brock completed her Great Journey without Dalien, eventually ending her Journey at Mahara Kesh, where she learned about using the Force for healing.[1]
            At some point Brock was a negotiator on Ska Gora and before she was able to finish the negotiations there one of the parties were killed and forests were set on fire.[2]
            Around 25,793 BBY Brock and fellow Je'daii Ranger Hawk Ryo were sent to Zerist by the Je'daii Council to prevent fighting between the Dessain Mining company and its miners, who were fighting over whether the miners would get a vote in how the company was run, and to find the kidnapped girl Oma Dessain. As Eomin Dessain, the leader of Dessain's management, refused to allow anyone who wasn't family to run the company, Oma was to marry Brom Santis, the leader of the miners Arko Santis' oldest son, as the marriage would allow Brom to be the voice of the miners. Brock acted as in intermediate to both parties while Ryo searched for Oma. Brock was later commed by Ryo who told her that it was possible that his crime lord brother, Baron Volnos Ryo, may have been involved in the girl's kidnapping and that he might have found where they were holding her.[2]
            After discovering that both parties were at their breaking points Brock fired her slugthrower into the ceiling to gather everyone's attention and suggested that they restart their negotiations. After Ryo rescued Oma Betolo, Eomin's servant, poisoned Brock's drink, Vaisamond red wine, in an attempt to kill her. She used the Force to stop him as he attempted to escape, and Betolo revealed the reason he betrayed the Dressians' and stated that with any luck Oma was dead. Ryo later returned Oma to Eomin and Oma refused to marry Brom. As she sympathized with Oma, Brock suggested that both family participate in the practice called Fostering.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lanoree_Brock</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLanoreeBrock</string></dict>

        <key>Brunson</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.495.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brunson was a human female who served as a captain in the Galactic Empire's Imperial Navy. She commanded an Arquitens-class command cruiser dispatched to Geonosis, the former site of the Death Star's construction, in 2 BBY, in response to a triggered proximity sensor. There, she discovered the rebel starship the Ghost on the planet. Hoping to earn herself and her crew promotions, she attempted to destroy the rebels using TIE bombers, rocket troopers, and finally by trapping the rebels in an underground cavern in an attempt to bury them alive. When she used her cruiser to block their escape, the Ghost fired two proton torpedoes, resulting in the destruction of her ship.
            Brunson was a young Captain in the Imperial Navy who commanded an Arquitens-class command cruiser.[1] About two years before the Battle of Yavin,[source?] she responded to a proximity alert on the planet Geonosis which had been triggered by a visit by the rebel cell Spectres, who were on a mission to find Saw Gerrera and investigate the disappearance of the Geonosian species. After one of her crew informed her that they had picked up live-readings on Geonosis, Captain Brunson deployed two TIE bombers to scout for intruders.[1]
            The TIE bombers soon discovered the rebel ship Ghost and strafed it. After the bomber crew transmitted a holographic image of the Ghost, Brunson recognized the ship as belonging to the Phoenix Cell, which was part of the rebellion. The Ghost managed to destroy the bombers. In response, Captain Brunson ordered her crew to pinpoint the rebel ship's last known location. She believed that they had fled into the depths of Geonosis. Brunson was proven right when they discovered that the Ghost had descended into a deep air shaft to rendezvous with their comrades, Saw, and the Geonosian Klik-Klak.[1]
            Brunson's light cruiser managed to trap the Ghost inside the air shaft. She then dispatched a squad of rocket troopers to board the rebel ship. However, the rebels managed to repel the boarders and destroy the entire squad. In response, Brunson ordered her crew to open fire on the rebel ship and to collapse the air shaft on top of them. Despite her efforts, the Spectres outwitted Brunson by using their laser cannons and proton torpedoes to blast through the Imperial light cruiser, setting it ablaze before fleeing into space.[1] Captain Brunson survived the explosion but her light cruiser was destroyed.[2]
            As a result, the Specters and Saw escaped offworld with imagery evidence of the poison canisters which the Empire had used to exterminate the Geonosians. In addition, they obtained a deflector core and helped Klik-Klak to escape with the last Geonosian queen egg into the deepest levels of Geonosis.[1]
            Brunson was later seen being escorted away from Grand Admiral Thrawn's office on board his flagship, the Chimaera, by a pair of stormtroopers, along with Commander Brom Titus and Captain Slavin. The three had been interviewed by the Grand Admiral as part of his investigation into the identity of a rebel spy in the local Imperial ranks. The group was passed by Lieutenant Yogar Lyste and Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus. The former referred to the trio as officers of the Lothal Sector's Command staff.[3]
            Brunson earned the high rank of captain at a young age,[2] proving herself to be a gifted but ultimately inexperienced commanding officer. She was an ambitious climber, regarding her duties on Geonosis with disdain and eager to destroy the Ghost in hopes of being promoted. This proved to be a naive decision on her part as she didn't fully appreciate the Ghost's feared reputation. Her attempt to trap the Ghost using her ship to block their escape resulted in her own ship being split in two by a pair of proton torpedoes. The Ghost's pilot Hera Syndulla remarked upon the captain's inexperience.[1]
            Unlike other Imperial officers, she did show some degree of camaraderie towards her subordinates, expressing her desire to see them all promoted. She could also be officious and petty towards them, as demonstrated when she responded to an officer's report that they had lost their rocket troopers by slapping him on the back of his head.[1]
            Brunson, voiced by Leslie L. Miller, first appeared in "Ghosts of Geonosis", the tenth and eleventh episodes of the third season of Star Wars Rebels,[1] which aired on January 7 2017.[4] Brunson was named after Jessica Brunson, the series look development production coordinator.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brunson</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBrunson</string></dict>

        <key>Brianna</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.497.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brianna, also known as "The Last Handmaiden," or simply "Handmaiden," was a half-Human half-Echani hybrid fighter, and illegitimate daughter to the famous Echani General Yusanis and Jedi Master Arren Kae, who both fought in the Mandalorian Wars. She later served along with her five half-sisters as a handmaiden to Jedi Master Atris in the period following the Jedi Civil War. During her service to Atris at the Jedi Academy on Telos IV, Brianna met Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile, and was subsequently tasked with accompanying her on her mission to seek out the Jedi Masters who survived the First Jedi Purge. As Surik's companion, Brianna helped battle against numerous adversaries, including the Sith Triumvirate.
            During the journey, Brianna trained Surik in Echani techniques and eventually received Jedi training from Surik in return, becoming one of the first new members of the Jedi Order after the Purge. In accepting such training, however, she broke her oath to Atris. The Jedi Master labeled her a traitor, resulting in a confrontation between Brianna, her sisters and her former master. According to the final predictions of Darth Traya, Brianna would become instrumental in the reconstruction of the Jedi Order and succeed Atris as Jedi historian.
            Brianna was born in 3976 BBY[1] as the result of a forbidden union between General Yusanis and Jedi Master Arren Kae. Yusanis, a master Echani combatant of the Republic world Eshan, was married to another woman to whom he had five daughters, while Kae, as a member of the Jedi Order was forbidden to form strong attachments. Despite these restrictions, the couple began a secret relationship, risking their status by continuing to meet. Despite Kae's attempts to keep the affair and Brianna's existence a secret, the Jedi Council eventually found out about the situation, and Kae was exiled from the Jedi Order as punishment.[2]
            Kae later chose to join her former apprentice, Revan, to fight the Mandalorians, who were bent on conquering the Outer Rim. Yusanis joined them, despite the fact that he was responsible for the care of Brianna and his other five daughters. Yusanis and Kae became known as heroes of the conflict, but Kae eventually fell in battle, and Yusanis returned a broken man, abandoning battle to become a senator. He avoided speaking of Kae, leaving Brianna with no memories of her mother. Later, Yusanis's old ally Revan declared himself the new Dark Lord of the Sith and turned on the Jedi, starting the Jedi Civil War. He sought to weaken the Republic, and targeted the Republic worlds of Serroco, Corellia and Eshan for destabilization. Revan accomplished his goals by assassinating a senator from each world, and the death of an Echani senator caught Yusanis' attention. When Yusanis found evidence of the act, he challenged Revan to a duel, but was ultimately slain by the Dark Lord, leaving Brianna an orphan.[2]
            Sometime after Yusanis's death, Brianna and her five half-sisters entered the service of Jedi Master Atris, one of the few Masters who survived the Jedi Civil War. The Jedi Order had been greatly divided and weakened by the war, and further attacks by a resurgent Sith Order after the war's conclusion left very few Jedi remaining. Atris hoped to revive the Jedi Order after most of the other Jedi Masters had been killed during one of these attacks on Katarr, and established a secret academy on Telos IV, a planet that had been devastated by Sith forces during the Jedi Civil War. The sisters joined her in the academy and agreed to serve as her handmaidens, aiding Atris in gathering Jedi artifacts from around the galaxy. At one point during their service, Brianna and her half-sisters swore an oath to Atris that they would never study the teachings of the Jedi, nor receive any instruction from a Jedi; although Brianna was the only handmaiden who had any Force sensitivity due to her heritage. While Atris knew of Brianna's familial lineage, as well as her sensitivity, she never mentioned Brianna's potential, and the handmaiden remained ignorant of her innate abilities.[2]
            The offspring of Echani parents appeared to non-Echani to look identical to their parents, typically the one of the same sex. As such, Brianna resembled her Jedi mother and not Yusanis' original wife, which distinguished her from her sisters as physical evidence of their father's affair. Her father's infidelity had brought shame on himself; and, after his death at the hands of Revan, that shame was thrust upon her, as the Echani believed that betrayal and shame were passed down through bloodlines. Despite working hard to disprove this stigma that followed her all through her young life, Brianna was branded the "Last of the Handmaidens" by her sisters, meaning she was the least of them, in terms of worth and combat ability. As a result, Brianna felt she was unworthy of bearing any signs of individuality and renounced her name in favor of her title.[2][3]
            The Jedi Academy was secluded in the isolated polar regions of Telos IV, and consequently, the academy remained unnoticed, even when the Republic began the Telosian Restoration Project in an effort to restore the ecosystem of the devastated planet. The project was headed by the Ithorian Chodo Habat and his herd, and a massive space station was built in orbit as a staging area for the project. When Atris later learned that the planet Peragus II, the main source of the station's fuel had been destroyed and that the Telos Security Force was holding suspects in the planet's destruction, who had recently arrived in the system, she ordered Brianna to investigate. Acting covertly, Brianna sneaked onto Citadel Station and stole the suspects' ship, the Ebon Hawk, as well as their droid, T3-M4, which was aboard as a result of the ship being impounded after arriving at Citadel Station shortly after the destruction of Peragus II. Brianna then brought the ship to the secret academy where Atris hoped to look into the events surrounding the destruction of the planet. Atris was unaware that the new owner of the ship was a former friend from the Jedi Order,[2] Meetra Surik,[4] also known as the Jedi Exile, another hero of the Mandalorian Wars who was exiled for her defiance of the Jedi Council and her decision to join Revan in the war. Surik was released from custody when it was discovered that Peragus II had been destroyed as a result of her escape from the Sith Lord Darth Sion, and she began a search for her stolen ship.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brianna</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBrianna</string></dict>
        <key>Mira Bridger</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.498.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mira Bridger was a human female from the Outer Rim planet of Lothal who was an outspoken opponent of the rule of the Galactic Empire. She and her husband, Ephraim, broadcast underground revolutionary messages against the Empire, and these actions were supported by Lothal's governor, Ryder Azadi. Because of their broadcasts, the Bridgers and Azadi were arrested and imprisoned by the Empire. This left their son, Ezra, to fend for himself on Lothal for nearly a decade.
            While in prison, Mira and Ephraim eventually learned that Ezra had become part of a rebel cell that fought against the Empire on Lothal. They heard a message of rebellion that he broadcast to Lothal and nearby star systems, a broadcast that inspired them to fight for their freedom from Imperial activity. Mira and her husband led a prison revolt that led to dozens of prisoners escaping, but Mira and Ephraim were killed during the escape.
            Mira Bridger was married to Ephraim Bridger and the two had one son, Ezra, who was born on the day that the Galactic Empire rose to power. When the Empire took control of the Bridger's homeworld of Lothal, a planet in the Outer Rim Territories, Mira and Ephraim became outspoken opponents of its rule, and the earliest rebels in the system.[3] In 14 BBY[4] they began to broadcast underground messages that spoke out against the Empire,[3] and these revolutionary tactics were supported by Lothal's governor, Ryder Azadi.[2] These activities led the Empire to send stormtroopers after them,[5] and the Bridgers, along with the governor, were arrested for treason.[2] A close friend of the Bridgers, a Rodian named Tseebo, promised to watch over Ezra, but he became fearful of the Empire and failed to look out for the boy. This left Ezra, only seven years old, to live on his own for the better part of a decade.[5]
            Several years later, while still in prison, Mira and Ephraim learned that Ezra was part of a rebel cell that fought against the Imperial Military on Lothal. He transmitted a message of rebellion to Lothal's citizens, urging them to stand up and fight for their freedom. This message traveled all across the galaxy, reaching and inspiring so many people, and finally made its way to the prison where the Bridgers were held. Mira and Ephraim, who for years had tried to help their fellow prisoners, knew that the voice was that of their son's because his words mirrored their own from so many years prior. Inspired by what Ezra said, Mira and Ephraim organized a prison break that led to dozens of prisoners, including Azadi, escaping to freedom. The Bridgers, however, were separated during the escape, and they refused to leave until everyone else had escaped. By the time their fellow prisoners were free, Mira and Ephraim had already been killed.[2]
            For years, while his parents were in captivity, Ezra did not want to know what happened to them, as he believed he would not be able to survive on his own if he held out hope that Mira and Ephraim would one day return to him. He did finally start to learn answers after encountering Tseebo, who went to work for the Imperial Information Office and stole critical information in the hopes of making up for his failure to help Ezra. Ezra did not initially learn what Tseebo knew about the Bridgers' captivity,[5] but the boy later learned about it from his Jedi teacher, Kanan Jarrus, and rebel captain Hera Syndulla. This revelation coincided with a vision of his parents that he received at the same time they were killed. The vision led him back to Lothal, which he and the rebels previously abandoned.[2]
            It was on Lothal that Ezra found Azadi, who had also returned in the hopes of finding Ezra so he could tell the boy what happened to Mira and Ephraim. Azadi explained what happened during the prison revolt and Ezra was grateful to know the truth, but he was nonetheless heartbroken by the loss of his parents. Soon after learning of their fates, he had another vision where he saw Mira and Ephraim through the Force, telling him that they were proud of him and urging him to remain strong. Ezra did not understand, at first, how he could see his parents, but Jarrus told him that the Jedi taught how life did not end at death but merely transformed into something new in the Force. Mira and Ephraim would always be with him, even if he could not see them.[2]
            One year before the Battle of Yavin, during the Liberation of Lothal, Ezra was welcomed aboard the Chimaera to talk with Emperor Sheev Palpatine about an offer he wanted to make. Attempting to lure the young Padawan to his trap by enter into the remains of the Lothal Jedi Temple, where Bridger heard the voice of Mira, calling him and telling him that she was baking his favorites. However, Ezra realized that it was just a lie because he sensed his parents' death and turned down Palpatine's offer before calling the purrgil to remove Grand Admiral Thrawn's Imperial forces from Lothal.[6]
            Mira Bridger was a human female with purple eyes and tan skin, and she wore a headpiece that covered her head. She was an outspoken opponent of the Empire's rule of Lothal, leading to her arrest and imprisonment with her husband. Even in prison, however, the Bridgers continued to stand up for other people, up until the point that they were killed in the prison revolt that they led so others could gain their freedom.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mira_Bridger</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMiraBridger</string></dict>

            Before the Clone Wars, Bonteri mentored Senator Padmé Amidala on Naboo. Bonteri also had a child, Lux Bonteri, with her husband.[5]
            By the time of the war, Bonteri had joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems and formed part of the Separatist Parliament. She was an admirer of Count Dooku for standing up to the Republic, which she viewed as corrupt. Her husband was sent to Aargonar to set up a base. However, he was killed when the clone forces of the Galactic Republic attacked.[5]
            Bonteri was later contacted by Amidala in an attempt to broker peace between the Republic and the Confederacy. She called for a vote to open peace talks with the Republic, which was passed by the Separatist Parliament, but her efforts were thwarted by a terrorist attack on Coruscant organized by Count Dooku and General Grievous.[5]
            Bonteri died shortly thereafter, and while Dooku publicly attributed her death to a Republic attack, some Republic spies instead reported that it was Dooku's agents who had killed her.[2]

        <key>Depa Billaba</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.503.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Depa Billaba, a Force-sensitive human female, was a Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council during the final years of the Jedi Order. She was born on Chalacta and became a member of the Order at a young age, where she was trained by Jedi Master Mace Windu. Billaba was later appointed to the Council alongside her former teacher, and was present when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn presented Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One to the governing body. She later attended Jinn's funeral after the Jedi Master was killed during the Battle of Naboo.
            Billaba continued to serve as a member of the Council during the political crisis that led to the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic civil war between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war, she took Caleb Dume as her Padawan learner. After the Conquest of Kaller, the two were attacked by Billaba's battalion of clone troopers after the execution of Order 66, a secret protocol branding all Jedi as enemies of the state. Due to Billaba's sacrifice, Dume survived the Jedi Purge and went into hiding under a new name—Kanan Jarrus. Initially traveling low and taking odd jobs, he eventually joined a group of rebels who opposed the Galactic Empire. Although Jarrus hid his true identity as a Jedi for years, he remembered his Master with fondness. After adopting Ezra Bridger as an apprentice, Jarrus initially relied on his own incomplete training under Billlaba in order to teach Bridger the ways of the Jedi and the Force.
            Depa Billaba was born on the planet Chalacta many years prior to the Clone Wars.[1] She had a sister, Sar Labooda.[11] As a child, she was held as a captive by space pirates who killed her parents.[7] She was rescued by Mace Windu, a member of the Jedi Order, and he brought her into the Order. Billaba became Windu's Padawan and trained under the Jedi Master in the ways of the Force until becoming a Jedi Knight. She was renowned for her skills with a lightsaber[1] and favored Form III when teaching other Jedi.[12]
            After several Padawans were kidnapped by the warlord Guattako on Oosalon, Windu was sent to find and rescue the missing Padawans. Eventually Windu was able to defeat all of Guattako's army. When he dueled with Guattako, Guattako used his staff to knock Windu out. When Guattako was about to kill Windu, a young Jedi shot and killed Guattako. Shortly after, Billaba, Plo Koon, and Qui-Gon Jinn arrived to help.[13]
            Eventually, Billaba was given a seat on the Jedi High Council, serving alongside Windu. During the Invasion of Naboo, she was present in the Council chambers of the Jedi Temple when Master Qui-Gon Jinn told the story of how he encountered Darth Maul on Tatooine, and how Jinn believed that Maul was a Sith Lord; Maul had been attempting to capture Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo. The Jedi Master also revealed he had found Anakin Skywalker, a young slave he had freed on the desert planet, and that he believed the boy was the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force. The Council was skeptical of both claims, but nonetheless agreed to test the boy and investigate Darth Maul. Despite being impressed with Skywalker's abilities, the Council initially rejected Jinn's request that the boy be admitted into the Jedi Order on the basis that Skywalker was too old to begin Jedi training. They instead ordered that Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, travel to Naboo to protect Queen Amidala, who was returning to her planet to fight back against the Trade Federation invasion.[8]
            The Federation's invasion and occupation ended during a battle to retake the planet. Maul mortally wounded Jinn in lightsaber combat, before Kenobi gravely wounded the Sith Lord; Maul went into exile and would not be heard from again for many years. Jinn's dying wish was that Kenobi train Skywalker as a Jedi, a wish that the Council agreed to. Billaba and other members of the Jedi Council traveled to Naboo and attended Jinn's funeral, before taking part in a ceremony marking a newfound peace between the humans and Gungans of Naboo; the Federation, as a common enemy, brought the once-feuding peoples together.[8]
            Master Billapa was the Jedi representative on the Republic's survey to the planet Bromlarch alongside Senators Mina Bonteri, Rush Clovis, and Amidala. They traveled with the planet's representative Caelor Gaans to analyze the damage to the aquaducts after a devastating groundquake. Billaba joined their ship for an orbital review. During the mission, the Jedi made sure to speak to Amidala, who she had met in the aftermath of the Invasion of Naboo four years earlier.[14]
            Shortly afterward, Billaba flew a Delta-7 starfighter as escort for a supply run, with the callsign Hazard Three. She flew interference for the convoy and Amidala's starship against the attacking pirates before they were able to escape.[14]
            Ten years later, the Secessionist Movement plunged the Galactic Republic into a political crisis, with thousands of star systems seceding from the Republic and joining the Confederacy of Independent Systems; the conflict was designed by Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith publicly known as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, as part of a plot to destroy the Jedi Order and take over the galaxy. Billaba was present on the Jedi Council when the body ordered Kenobi to investigate the plot to assassinate now-Senator Amidala, an outspoken opponent of the Military Creation Act that would have allowed the Republic to raise an army to combat the Separatists; Skywalker was further ordered to travel with Amidala to Naboo so she could be protected from harm. These events led Kenobi to discover a clone army built for the Republic in secret on Kamino, and the Galactic Senate to grant Chancellor Palpatine emergency executive power. The Chancellor enlisted the clones as the Grand Army of the Republic, and they were put to use in the Battle of Geonosis, which sparked the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separatists—just as Sidious had intended.[15] Her sister, Labooda, was killed during the battle.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Depa_Billaba</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDepaBillaba</string></dict>

She and Brontes were the only female Masters. She wielded a red bladed lightsaber, and was considered the most powerful of her colleagues.
            Dread Master Bestia was known to be the keeper of the Seeds of Rage, powerful devices that would induce fear, terror and mutation to their location. It is possible the theft of the seeds and their use were her sole plan as they were her property.
            Bestia, similar to her 'sister' Brontes, had great interest in genetic and biological altering and mutation. Bestia had various creatures at her disposal which she claimed were 'legion', acting as one for her bidding. These creatures, though mutated and quite powerful, listened to her call and did as she ordered.
            Bestia used her monster forces as her front line offence most of the time, though this did not mean she was unskilled in combat; in fact it was far from it. Bestia's physical abilities exceeded that of any normal Jedi or Sith. She was fast, powerful, and a master of Force and saber combat.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bestia</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBestia</string></dict>
        <key>Zari Bangel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.506.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zari Bangel was a female[2] human[1] pilot who flew in the New Republic's starfleet.[2] In 28 ABY,[3] she was stationed on the Republic's capital world Hosnian Prime. There she and several of her colleagues took note of how close their fellow pilot Joph Seastriker had come to the senatorial staff of Princess Leia Organa, with whom he was secretly working on an investigation into the criminal Rinnrivin Di.[2]
            While Seastriker was working on his X-wing starfighter in the Senate hangar, she commented on how he had been sharing drinks with Organa's staff and how unusual his prolonged service to a specific senator was. Envious of Seastriker's seemingly important work, she and a number of others made clear that they wanted in on the action, prompting Seastriker to take down their names, but reveal nothing more. When Organa then formed the Resistance following the end of the investigation into Di, Seastriker personally vouched for Bangel and some of the other pilots on the list, and they were invited to join the Resistance, attending the organization's first meeting in a hangar that Organa had privately leased. While in the Senate hangar bay, Bangel wore a tool belt.[2]
            In 34 ABY, Bangel attempted to help Jessika Pava find a new astromech to fly with her and convince the Resistance astromechs that she was not "The Great Destroyer" they defined her as, but when they turned away to deal with C-3PO momentarily, the astromechs ran off minus BB-8 who flipped out his lighter.[1]

As the Clone Wars drew to an end, Bene was killed by the Sith Lord Darth Vader during Order 66 and the fall of the Jedi Temple.
            Bene was raised as a member of the Jedi Order during the final years of the Galactic Republic. In the waning days of the Clone Wars, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine commanded the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic to execute Order 66, labeling every Jedi an enemy of the state and therefore subject to summary execution. When the 501st Legion stormed the Jedi Temple of Coruscant, Bene confronted the fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker—now anointed as the Sith Lord Darth Vader—[3] with the aid of Whie Malreaux and Jedi Master Cin Drallig. Despite their combined effort, Vader killed[2] his former comrades in lightsaber combat.[3] Bene's death was later witnessed by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Skywalker's Jedi Master, through a holographic security recording.[2]
            As a Jedi, Bene rallied to the defense of the Jedi Temple against a legion of clone soldiers led by a former Jedi Knight who turned to the dark side of the Force. She was a human female who possessed brown hair and eyes, as well as fair complexion.[3]
            Bene's connection to the Force allowed her to harness its powers, and she was therefore trained as a Jedi Padawan. By the time of Order 66, she wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber.[3]
            Mousy McCallum, daughter of the Star Wars prequel trilogy producer Rick McCallum, portrayed Bene in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bene</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBene</string></dict>

        <key>Lana Beniko</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.510.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lana Beniko was a female Human Sith Lord of the Sith Empire. During the Galactic War against the Galactic Republic she served as an advisor to Dark Council member Darth Arkous. Investigating Arkous' unusual activities in the wake of the Korriban Incursion, Beniko discovered that Arkous was a traitor secretly working for the Order of Revan. To expose Arkous, Beniko teamed up with unusual allies, including Republic SIS agent Theron Shan, a Wookiee smuggler named Jakarro, and other figures of importance on galactic scale. The group tracked Arkous and his Revanite ally Rian Darok to Rakata Prime, where both were killed, only for Revan himself to enter the scene and attempt to kill Beniko and her allies. Proclaimed a traitor to the Empire, Beniko was forced into hiding along with Theron Shan and Jakarro. The three eventually tracked the Revanites to Rishi and were able to expose the conspiracy to Darth Marr. To stop Revan from resurrecting Sith Emperor Vitiate, Beniko and Marr joined forces with Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan and traveled to Yavin 4, forming a temporary coalition between the Republic and the Empire. Beniko stood against Revan himself alongside Darth Marr, Satele and Theron Shan, Jakarro, and Shae Vizla . Though Revan was defeated, the Emperor nevertheless returned to life. Darth Marr appointed Beniko as the new head of the reformed Sith Intelligence. As the new Sith Intelligence Minister, Lana opposed Vitiate's resurgence on Ziost, working with her assistant Rane Kovach and her partners from the Yavin Coalition to stop the rampage caused by the former Emperor. Though Shan and Beniko were able to shock a large number of Vitiate's victims unconscious and remove Sixth Line Jedi Master Surro from the planet's surface, Vitiate still performed the ritual that wiped out all life on the planet.
            Later that year, the galaxy was invaded by the Eternal Empire of Zakuul, which overwhelmed both the Republic and the Sith Empire within a single year. Sith Intelligence effectively ceased to exist, and Beniko ventured into Eternal Empire space, looking for her partner from the Revanite crisis, believing that person to be the galaxy's last hope of defeating the Eternal Empire. Over five years, Beniko made multiple contacts, such as former Knight of Zakuul Senya Tirall and exiled Zakuulan naval officer Koth Vortena, with whom she eventually managed to find and free the one Zakuulans had taken to calling the Outlander from being frozen in carbonite. While escaping pursuit, Beniko's group located and repaired the Gravestone - a legendary vessel capable of opposing the might of the Eternal Fleet. Beniko called her multiple contacts from the Sith Empire, the Republic, and the criminal underworld to converge on the remote planet Odessen, where she laid the foundations of an Alliance dedicated to defeating Eternal Emperor Arcann, becoming the right hand to her old associate, who became the Alliance Commander. In a bid to remove the advantage of Arcann's Eternal Fleet, the Alliance agreed to SCORPIO's plan to remotely take control of the GEMINI captains, but SCORPIO followed her own agenda and used that opportunity to claim the Eternal Throne for herself. In the resulting battle of Odessen, Beniko accompanied the Commander to their duel with Arcann, which ended with the Emperor defeated and taken away by his mother Senya Tirall. Arcann's sister Vaylin allied herself with SCORPIO and became the new Eternal Empress, and Beniko stood by the Commander's side as they battled her forces on Voss. An attempt by Vaylin to take control of the Gravestone led to the discovery of the hidden artificial world Iokath, which Alliance forces had to temporarily abandon when it was covered in deadly radiation. Beniko assisted in the mission to sabotage the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin and accompanied the Commander on a mission to Nathema. Vaylin soon launched an assault on Odessen, in which Beniko fought on the front lines and which led to Vaylin's death at the Commander's hand. Alliance forces then traveled to Zakuul, where the Commander claimed the Eternal Throne and took control over the Eternal Fleet, transforming the Alliance from an anti-Zakuul insurgency into the Eternal Alliance.
            As one of the highest-ranking members of a new galactic power, Beniko had to contend with new threats from the earliest hours of its existence. She identified and ordered the neutralization of several local uprisings against the Alliance and personally led a mission to Iokath once its radiation levels had subsided. Faced with both the Republic and the Sith Empire fighting over control of an Iokath superweapon, Beniko followed the Commander's decision to ally with one galactic power against another. Beniko soon discovered that the War on Iokath was orchestrated by an outside party that had leaked information to all three sides, hoping to start a war between them over control of Iokath. She began to search for a traitor within the Eternal Alliance, which led to the shadow world of Umbara. Lana Beniko, Theron Shan, and the Commander traveled there to intercept the traitor, only for Theron to reveal himself as the traitor and sabotage the hovertrain the Commander and Beniko were on. Escaping the train before the crash, Beniko and the Commander were unable to stop Theron before his shuttle left Umbara. They returned to Odessen, where Beniko began to search for Theron's whereabouts. After failing to apprehend him on the Chiss world of Copero, Beniko and the Commander eventually followed Theron and the Order of Zildrog to Nathema, where Theron revealed himself to be a double agent working for the Alliance the whole time. Together, they rushed to stop Vinn Atrius from awakening Zildrog, but were too late to prevent the complete destruction of the Eternal Fleet, the Gravestone, and the Eternal Throne. Though the Alliance lost its most powerful assets, Lana ensured the Commander that she would remain at their side through whatever would come. As the Third Galactic War approached, Beniko implored the Outlander to chose a side, promising to be loyal to them regardless.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lana_Beniko</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemLanaBeniko</string></dict>
        <key>Rasha Bex</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.511.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rasha Bex was a spy for the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. She was a Human female with brown eyes and long brown hair.
            She infiltrated the six Rebel cells loyal to Garm Bel Iblis on Stoga, before being discovered. She hired the smuggler BoShek to get her to safety from the Rebel leaders Karn and Lhira, letting him think that she was no more than another individual turned off by the extremism of the Rebellion.
            Once BoShek delivered her to safety, Bex allowed him to be arrested by Imperial officers after he turned down her offer of Imperial employment, even though she had grown attracted to him during their night together and had kissed him passionately only moments before. A few months later, she would come to the aid of the Ahakistan rebels looking to sabotage an Imperial computer hub at Pyramid One, in the hopes that her new allies could help reunite her with the imprisoned BoShek. She met the rebels at the Daystar Casino whose owner had brought with himself a motley group who he had claimed were members of the Rebel Alliance.
            At first, the Rebel cell members were suspicious of her presence but welcomed her at the behest of Sardoth who also told Tarson that she was looking for BoShek. During the meeting, Sardoth informed the cell members that the Empire had been using Ahakista as a base for the Hub, a supercomputer housed inside the pyramid at the center of the city. The Hub was of great importance to the Empire, since it purpose was to coordinate the vast Imperial Navy.
            Part of the plot for infiltrating the Hub involved using an ancient series of tunnels under the pyramid which housed the Hub. However, these tunnels were blocked by a blast door blocked by a protective energy field and guarded by Stormtroopers. Due to her knowledge of the building, Bex was assigned the job of disabling the energy field. The only way was to destroy its power source which was the grid's power control station on the tenth floor. Sardoth then came to the reason for why he had contacted Dunlan: He wanted Dunlan's group of rebels to destroy the pyramid's power control station so that the off-worlders could infiltrate and destroy the Hub itself.
            However, this plan sparked division among the Rebel cell members particularly Dunlan who argued that a frontal assault on the pyramid was suicidal, resulting in heavy casualties. Enraged, Dunlan and other members of the local Ahakistan resistance stormed out of the meeting. Amidst the uproar, Rasha commented that without Dunlan attacking the power station, the plan would fall apart. Discouraged, Bex attempted to back-out of the plot but was stopped by Tarson who ordered her to find a way to shut down the power generator or she would never see Boshek again. He then reiterated that they were taking the Hub and they were doing it now despite Dunlan's withdrawal.
            Arriving at the power control station on the tenth floor of Pyramid One, Captain Bex was confronted by an inquisitive Captain Tregor who was suspicious of her presence in a maximum-security area. Rasha claimed that she was there to appraise his security arrangements as part of a new security initiative brought in by Darth Vader. She reiterated that any lack of compliance would be reported. As Bex approached the power generator controls, she attempted to find away to shut them down but was cornered by Tregor.
            Burning with rage and taking note of her suspicious behavior, Tregor attempted to expose her. With her cover exposed, Bex pushed away his hands and kicked him in the lips. Taking advantage of his bigger size, Tregor quickly regained the upper hand and wrestled her to the floor. He was about to kill her on the spot when he was caught in an explosion that incapacitated him. On the run from Vader's troops, a wounded Dunlan had fired a surface-to-air missile at the power generator. With the power generator destroyed and Tregor incapacitated, a shocked Bex made her way out of the station.
            Fans speculated that Rasha Bex and Captain Bex were somehow related. However, Randy Stradley has stated that they are simply two different characters who share the same last name and are not in fact related.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rasha_Bex</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemRashaBex</string></dict>

She was close friends with the then-Padawan Juhani during her training there as well.
            When the amnesiac Revan escaped from Taris and returned to the Jedi Enclave, Belaya felt the strength of the Force within him and stopped him on his way to talk to the Council. She berated him for not wearing proper robes, under the assumption he was actually a Padawan. After explaining himself, Belaya apologized, and she later offered insight for Revan on the Jedi Code when he began his training again. Despite her relationship with Juhani, or rather because of it, the Council believed that if Belaya attempted to bring her distraught companion back it would cause more harm than good. She could not speak of it to Revan, who had been given the task of "cleansing the tainted grove" as part of his last test to become a Padawan. Belaya's patience was rewarded when Revan succeeded in his task and managed to convince Juhani to turn away from the dark side and return to the Enclave. She expressed her deep felt gratitude.
            In the Slavic tongues, "belaya" (e.g. Russian: белая/belaja, Polish: biała, etc.) is the feminine adjective used for the colour "white".
            When Belaya discovered that Juhani was slain by the aspiring new Padawan Revan, she became aggrieved and enraged. She lashed out at Revan upon his return, saying that Juhani had deserved a better chance from him, and from the Council who had sent him so ill-prepared. Regardless of Revan's intentions she could not be consoled, and she left the Jedi Order, ending up on Korriban and joining the Sith Academy there. On Revan's quest to find the Star Map there, Belaya once again confronted him on Korriban, this time outside the Sith Academy where nobody would stop her. She angrily questioned his presence there, then swearing vengeance for Juhani, she attacked Revan but was killed by the former Sith Lord.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Belaya</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBelaya</string></dict>
        <key>Barukka</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.513.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Barukka was a female Dathomiri, a former Nightsister, and the sister of the Nightsister leader Gethzerion. The daughter of the Singing Mountain Clan's leader, Augwynne Djo, she turned to the dark side of the Force but was able to break away from its influence and exiled herself. She petitioned unsuccessfully to rejoin her original clan, and was subsequently tormented mentally by Gethzerion, slowly being driven insane.
            After being approached by Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker to find parts for the Millennium Falcon, Barukka was able to start redeeming herself. Skywalker helped her overcome her guilt, and she was able to return to the light side after Gethzerion was killed by the Imperial warlord, Zsinj. After Barukka completed the redemption process, she was able to return to her clan.
            The daughter of Augwynne Djo, Barukka was raised in the Singing Mountain Clan by her mother alongside her sisters, Gethzerion, Kara'Teel, and Allaya Djo. However, around 1 ABY, Gethzerion betrayed her mother and attempted to assassinate her, killing Kara'Teel in the process, though Augwynne survived the attempt on her life. After these events, Gethzerion was exiled and chose to become a Nightsister, starting a clan of darksiders who imposed terror on the other clans, as well as the people that were imprisoned on Dathomir by the Galactic Empire. Barukka would later fall to the dark side at some point prior to 8 ABY and joined her sister's clan as a Nightsister. She learned the Nightsisters' spells and became powerful in the process, possessing an aura of dark power surrounding her body in the Force.[1]
            During her life as a Nightsister, Barukka committed atrocities that were unspoken of in her old clan. She gained valuable knowledge around the Imperial prison on Dathomir, which served as their base, but she eventually started to regret her actions. She left the Nightsisters, then exiled herself to a cavern known as the Rivers of Stone. During this time, she petitioned to rejoin the Singing Mountain Clan, though her mother seemed hesitant to allow her return, fearing that Barukka was emotionally unstable and untrustworthy due to her former actions as a Nightsister.[1]
            Since Barukka lived and did everything alone, she was left completely vulnerable and, in the days that followed her self imposed exile, was tortured by Gethzerion for leaving the Nightsisters. Gethzerion called for her to return and would hunt for Barukka, determined to either bring her back into the clan, drive her mad, or kill her for her betrayal. Barukka heard Gethzerion as if she was right beside her, screaming and cursing at her, and Gethzerion also kept Barukka awake at night by doing this, depriving her of sleep. Eventually, Barukka would become convinced that Gethzerion held a great deal of power over her and that she couldn't stop her or even help herself. This drove Barukka mad; she would talk to herself in the third person, and would tremble at the thought of giving out any information about the Nightsisters to their enemies.[1]
            Barukka's madness would soon end with her redemption. Due to her former status as a Nightsister, Barukka was sought out by the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, his sister, Leia Organa, the pilot and co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo and Chewbacca, Barukka's niece Teneniel Djo, and the Hapan prince Isolder, in 8 ABY for information about the Imperial prison. However, Barukka commanded the party to leave, reasoning that she was forsaken and couldn't offer them shelter because of this. Skywalker tried to reason with her, but Barukka simply warned them about the upcoming war the Singing Mountain Clan faced with the Nightsisters, and that she was being summoned by Gethzerion. After Teneniel asked for directions to find parts for the Millennium Falcon in the prison, Barukka simply rambled to them about how Gethzerion was driving her mad. Skywalker was finally able to convince her to reveal the locations by explaining that he was a Jedi Knight.[1]
            She obliged by conjuring up a perfect full scale model of the prison from the dirt on the ground, with tiny replicas of people walking about it. After pointing out key locations in the prison, the model collapsed when Barukka saw Gethzerion in it, staring at her with accusing eyes. Barukka fell to the floor and grieved to Skywalker, complaining about the damage she had done to herself as a Nightsister. Skywalker then gave her advice on how to give up her guilt and how to begin the first steps towards the light. Fortunately for Barukka, Gethzerion's clan of Nightsisters was killed when their ship was destroyed by the Imperial warlord, Zsinj, who had set up a blockade to prevent the Nightsisters from leaving. After the ordeal, Barukka redeemed herself and returned to her clan.[1]
            Barukka, being a former Nightsister, committed numerous crimes using the dark side without hesitation and had a dark aura flowing about her, symbolizing her abuse of the dark side. However, she felt guilt for her crimes unlike her sister, Gethzerion, and because of this, was able to begin redeeming herself. Gethzerion would not allow this, and she slowly drove her sister mad by keeping her awake at night, screaming and cursing at her using the Force, and stalking without end. By the time she met Luke Skywalker, she had gone completely insane, speaking in the third person, and believed that Gethzerion had exerted complete control over her.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Barukka</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemBarukka</string></dict>

            Less harsh in her judgments than fellow Master Vrook Lamar, Master Nisi did not hold Duron Qel-Droma's relationship to Ulic Qel-Droma against him. She believed that it was one's choices, not bloodline, that could lead to the dark side. She agreed with Vrook, however, that the small group of three Jedi Knights secretly sent to Korriban to purge the planet of terentateks was too small, fearing that the party would be corrupted by the planet's dark influence.
            She was still on the council as of 3964 BBY, but was replaced by Master Dorak by 3956 BBY.

        <key>Ashana</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.521.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ashana was Human female singer from Taris and sister of Elinda, the original lead singer of the Twisted Rancor Trio band.
            In 3956 BBY, Ashana's sister Elinda was a rising star as the singer of the Twisted Rancor Trio band founded by Gilthos Uksaris. Elinda's fans admired her voice, and the band at last attracted the attention of the local, powerful businessman Davik Kang, who invited them to play at his estate. Kang, however, was actually the head of the criminal organization the Exchange, and Elinda feared the consequences should Kang somehow be malcontent with her performance or should she even have dealings with him at all. Such was her apprehension that in spite of Uksaris's conviction that Kang's sponsorship was too grand of an opportunity to reject, Elinda abandoned the band altogether.
            Without a singer, the Twisted Rancor Trio seemed to be at its end, but on the eve of the scheduled performance, Uksaris recruited Ashana as a replacement for her sister. By Uksaris's own admission, the plan was risky given Ashana's untested singing and the last minute recruitment without prior rehearsals, and should Ashana fail to live up to Elinda's reputation, the band could incur the notorious wrath of Kang, putting their lives in jeopardy. Uksaris, however, believed that the scheme was still worth the risks, hoping that should they succeed, Kang would sign them up on a great touring contract.
            Ashana only appears as a hologram in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, if the player, as Revan, visits an apartment in the Lower City Apartment containing a delivery to Uksaris secured by a Holo-Sec Corp anti-theft explosive. To safely disarm the trap, the player must activate all six holoprojectors of the band members surrounding the footlocker in order of their recruitment. The solution to this puzzle is given in a datapad resting on a nearby desk that contains a draft of Guts and Glory: A Chronicle of The Amazing Story of The Twisted Rancor Trio, a brief narrative of the history of the band authored by Gilthos Uksaris.
            Since the incomplete chronicle ends on the eve of the scheduled performance when Ashana is recruited, her success or failure is unknown.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ashana</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAshana</string></dict>

Hetkins received a cybernetic replacement limb, and she aided him in first attempting to use it. After running several simple physical tests with the aid of an FX-7 medical assistant droid, she declared that everything seemed fine and questioned Hetkins about his mental health. She was not fooled by his claims of being all right, and after her FX-7 confirmed he was lying based on his medical readout, she instructed him to return to the hospital regularly for group therapy with other veterans, or attend sessions she would set up elsewhere if he wished to leave the planet. She also provided him with the therapy droid QT-9, whom he begrudgingly took home.[1]

        <key>Darsha Assant</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.523.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darsha Assant was a Human female Jedi Padawan who wielded a yellow lightsaber and was the apprentice of Master Anoon Bondara prior to the Battle of Naboo.
            During a mission that likely would have earned her Knighthood, had it been successfully completed, she instead became one of the many Jedi victims of Darth Maul.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Darsha Assant was discovered as an orphan on her homeworld of Alderaan by Jedi Master Anoon Bondara when she was two years old. Bondara took the young girl to the Coruscant Jedi Temple where Assant was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order's greatest instructors, including Master Qui-Gon Jinn. After passing through the Temple academy, Assant was selected by Master Bondara to continue her training as a Padawan.[1]
            During her training with Bondara, Padawan Assant constructed a yellow-bladed lightsaber, wielding it bravely and skillfully; during a training bout, Assant bested fellow Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. After years of study with Master Bondara to become a Guardian, the Twi'lek believed her ready to face the Trials of Knighthood and recommended her knighting to the Jedi High Council.[1]
            Standing before the High Council, Assant was tasked with recovering the Fondorian informant Oolth from Coruscant's undercity by Master of the Order Mace Windu. If she completed this mission successfully, the High Council would elevate her to the rank of Jedi Knight. While Assant was excited to face her first solo mission, her master was wary that it was too challenging for the girl, but would abide by the High Council's wisdom.[1]
            Delving into the Crimson Corridor's most dangerous and hostile area, Assant attempted to bring Oolth back to her skyhopper which had just fell in the hands of the notorious Raptors, a vicious gang of criminals. Using the force to control the minds of the numerous Raptor criminals, she worked her way to the skyhopper, but, was interrupted by Oolth's screams in the adjacent alley, who's leg was being bitten by an armored rat. Her connection to the force persuasion of the Raptor gang became severed. Assant was forced to fight off her attackers with her lightsaber, cutting off limbs and injuring many of the Raptors to the point of making them flee from her savage defense. In the ensuing melee, a Raptor's vibroblade damaged the skyhopper's control panel, rendering it inoperable. After rescuing Oolth from the armored rat and finding the skyhopper damaged, Assant realized they needed to ascend at least 20 meters through the fog layer to escape the Coruscant downlevels of the Crimson Corridor and arrange transportation back to the Jedi Temple. One or two of the Raptor gang still hadn't given up the previous assault and began firing on Assant and Oolth. So Assant fired her ascension gun above the fog layer to where the grappling hook would find purchase on the ledge of the nearest building. As they ascended with Oolth wrapped around Assant's body, they ran into a nest of the extremely territorial hawk-bats, that were defending a nearby nest. The hawk-bats began pecking at Assant &amp; the Fondorian through the ascent up the building, causing deep cuts on both and eventually pecking out Oolth's eye, among other injuries. He let go of Assant to fight off the hawk-bats, and fell 10-15 meters to the pavement below, killing him. Assant used her lightsaber to break a glass window into the building to escape the hawk-bats' rage.
            Having failed in her task, Assant returned to the Temple where she revealed her failure to her master. She expected her master and the Council to be angry at the news of her failure. In the end, however, he was just glad to see her alive. Master Bondara, not convinced of Oolth's death, accompanied Assant back to the area in search of the informant. Finding nothing left on the pavement but a blood spot, Bondara and Assant sensed a disturbance in the force nearby. Flying their speeder to the source of the disturbance, they saw Darth Maul using his Force Leap ability to catch up with Lorn Pavan and I-5YQ. Darth Maul had just performed the assassination of the Trade Federation employee Hath Monchar but left a Sith Holocron with knowledge of the Trade Federation's embargo of Naboo plans within Monchar's open safe in Monchar's apartment. Lorn Pavan retrieved this Sith Holocron when he was about to visit Monchar but found him dead just like Yanth the Hutt whom he tried to sell the Holocron to when he was interrupted by Darth Maul who took the Sith Holocron from Yanth's dead fingers.
            Now, Lorn Pavan and his droid were running from Darth Maul's force leaps. Master Bondara then managed to incapacitate Darth Maul with Bondara's speeder and rescued Lorn Pavan and I-5YQ. Darth Maul, however, recovered faster than they anticipated. As they were leaving, Maul was able to force leap and hang onto the underside of the speeder. He began to cut into the the speeder, which damaged it, preventing the speeder from ascending past level 20. Darsha Assant used a force shove powerful enough to cause Maul to lose his grip and drop to the ground. Darth Maul proceeded to follow the speeder with a speederbike of his own but Bondara jumped onto Maul's speeder and engaged in a fierce lightsaber duel. Before leaping, Bondara told Assant to get back to the Jedi Temple and safeguard Lorn Pavan and I5, but Assant went to save her Master instead. Bondara fought Darth Maul on the roof of a nearby building where Maul's speederbike crashed, and, knowing he was overmatched, sent his lightsaber through Maul's speederbike into the repulsor drive housing causing the speeder bike's explosion, killing Bondara in the process and stunning Darth Maul who fell 50 stories to the pavement and remained unconscious for some time. Within the speeder skycar, Assant tried to steer away from the explosion but could not, damaging the skycar further, though I5 dragged away Lorn Pavan and Assant once the skycar settled to the Coruscant downlevel pavement just before the speeder exploded. Assant was knocked unconscious for a long while but later helped guide I5 and Lorn Pavan through the Coruscant underground to avoid Darth Maul.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darsha_Assant</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemDarshaAssant</string></dict>
        <key>Tash Arranda</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.524.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tash Arranda was a Force-sensitive Human female from Alderaan who survived the destruction of her homeworld and later became a Jedi of the New Jedi Order. She was the daughter of Milessa and Kalf Arranda and the older sister of Zak Arranda.
            Tash and her younger brother, Zak Arranda, were born on Alderaan. Tash had very few friends on Alderaan; she was considered to be odd, due to her habit of finishing others' sentences. At some point, she began accessing the HoloNet where she learned of the Jedi after some information was uploaded onto the galactic communication service. Despite the study of the Jedi Knights being illegal under the rule of the Galactic Empire, Tash began to search through library databases from her desk computer in order to find out more about the near forgotten Jedi Order. After breaking through the code, she began to learn more about the order from an unknown individual on the HoloNet who went under the name of ForceFlow.[1]
            Some time later, both Tash and her brother embarked on a field trip off planet for two weeks. However, during that time, the Empire deployed their Death Star I battle station which destroyed Alderaan. This led to everyone they had known including their parents, friends and neighbors being killed in the resultant destruction of the planet. Both children were later adopted by their Shi'ido uncle, anthropologist Mammon Hoole, who was only related to them because his brother married the Arrandas' Aunt Beryl. They accompanied Hoole and his research droid, DV-9, on his adventures as he studied the sapient races of the galaxy. In the first six months of this journey, Hoole never told the children about their destinations or even his first name. During this time, he also had his personal research droid DV-9 tutor the children in various subjects.[1]
            One of their earliest adventures was an expedition to the planet D'vouran though Hoole never told Tash or her brother of the destination. While she was pretending that she was a Jedi pilot fighting Imperial pilots, the Lightrunner came out of hyperspace early and nearly crashed on the planet. However, Hoole managed to land the ship though it was badly damaged in the process. They attempted to gain the aid of the native Enzeen that inhabited the planet's surface. During their time there, Tash began to get a bad feeling that something was watching them and she did not entirely trust the Enzeen. Desptie this being the case, both Hoole and her brother did not believe her. Hoole later planned to leave the children in his droids care while he went to conduct some research but Tash, her brother and DV-9 found themselves taken hostage by the criminal henchmen of Smada the Hutt who had a desire to make use of Hoole's shape changing abilities in order to serve as his assassin. When Hoole refused, Smada ordered his Gank killers to vaporize the Arrandas though they were stopped by the intervention of the Heroes of Yavin. While they helped Hoole repair the ship, Tash confessed to Luke Skywalker that she received strange "feelings" at times of danger though dismissed them. He counseled her by saying that she should trust her feelings. This led to her examining information on the Misanthrope on the HoloNet from the Millennium Falcon's computer. During her search, Imperial forces attempted to track down her signal but after Skywalker told her, she shut the computer down to prevent her from being traced. At night, she and her brother stayed at one of the Enzeen's homes while being under the supervision of DV-9. During the night, she began to hear strange noises but she only found Chood who claimed it was stray animals. When she returned to her room, she found one of Smada the Hutt's henchmen attempting to abduct her sleeping brother. They managed to escape the Ganks and fled to the Don't Go Inn where they were sheltered though no one believed their claims of the Hutt's henchmen. This led to Hoole telling Tash that her obsession with the Force was going too far and that she needed to stop fixating on it, something that disheartened her. Later, her brother was nearly killed by Smada but was saved by Hoole's intervention. At this point, she accompanied the seemingly crazy hermit known as Kevreb Bebo He led her to an abandoned Imperial lab and told her that all of his companions had mysteriously disappeared. He gave her a pendant that he believed prevented him from disappearing as well. She left the lab and was subsequently captured by Smada, who wanted to use her and Zak to draw Hoole out of hiding. They were later rescued and escaped D'Vouran.[1]
            The children were Force-sensitive, and briefly encountered Jedi Master Yoda on Dagobah shortly before the Battle of Hoth. They also met Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia Organa, and Han Solo. While practicing with the Force, she found out that when she was angry she was more powerful. She found herself upset to discover Hoole once worked for Gog.
            Both of the Arrandas received university training after the threat of the Empire had lessened and became anthropologists themselves. They also attended the Jedi Praxeum for a time before Hoole moved them to an undisclosed location, possibly New Alderaan.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tash_Arranda</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTashArranda</string></dict>
        <key>Acina</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.525.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Empress Acina, formerly known as Darth Acina, was a Human female Dark Lord of the Sith and a member of the Sith Empire's ruling Dark Council during the Galactic War with the Galactic Republic. Following the Eternal Empire's conquest, and the deaths or disappearances of the other members of the Dark Council, she claimed the title of Empress of the Sith, becoming the sole ruler of the Sith Empire.
            Acina spent her early Sith training in the Sith Academy on Korriban, where as some of her earliest trials as the Sith apprentice she was required to kill local vermin in the tombs located in the Valley of the Dark Lords. She eventually obtained the title of the Dark Lord of the Sith. In 3640 BBY she was chosen by the Emperor's Hand to be the new head of the Sphere of Technology after the death of Darth Karrid at Duro and to watch over a warehouse of powerful technology known as the Arcanum. During that time her position on the Dark Council was strong, as she controlled all access to Arcanum, requiring others Councillors to impress her. However, one of her apprentices had secretly sworn loyalty to the Dread Masters, which allowed their follower Tagriss to organize a Raid on the Arcanum and escape with many dangerous artifacts such as the Darkstaff and the Seeds of Rage. Her position imperiled, Acina was quick to summon help from an Imperial individual to assist in locating and recovering the seeds. Eventually succeeding in recovering the last of the Seeds on Ilum, the Imperial returned them to Acina, who planned to hide them on Ziost.
            In 3637 BBY the Eternal Empire of Zakuul revealed itself to the larger galaxy and launched the Eternal Empire conquest on both the Empire and the Republic. Within a year, Dromund Kaas was blockaded and most of the Dark Council members either died or disappeared during the chaos. Darth Acina was the first to recognize that the Sith were outmatched and the only one of the Dark Council to remain by the time Zakuul–Imperial treaty was negotiated by by the Minister of Logistics. In a power vacuum, Darth Acina assumed leadership of the Empire and declared herself Empress of the Sith, declaring loyalty to Emperor Arcann of the Eternal Empire, who publicly acknowledged her claim.
            Acina continued to rule the Sith Empire for the next five years, her rule supported by the majority of the population. As Empress, she bided her time during Arcann's reign, but after his defeat at the hands of the Outlander during the Battle of Odessen, she saw the opportunity to reclaim the Sith Empire's power. Realizing that the Alliance that defeated Arcann would be strong enough to eventually defeat Arcann's notoriously unstable sister Vaylin, she openly defied her heralds, putting an end to an era of Sith submission. When Vaylin's Eternal Fleet launched an Invasion of Voss, Acina set the Imperial fleet to aid the Alliance and its Commander in battle. The timing of the Imperial fleet's arrival proved fortunate, as it was able to drive away the Eternal Fleet and put a decisive end to the battle. In the aftermath, Acina acknowledged the Alliance as an independent power and invited the Alliance Commander to Dromund Kaas to negotiate an agreement.
            When the Alliance Commander arrived on Dromund Kaas, Acina sent the current Minister of Logistics Gelmid Lorman to escort her guest from the spaceport. After the Alliance Commander with the advisors Lana Beniko and Theron Shan were brought to Acina's chambers, whothe Empress suggested that she and the Commander should discuss their alliance in private aboard her personal shuttle. In flight and away from prying eyes, Acina assured the Commander that her offer was genuine, and that she had no intention of taking the Eternal Throne for herself. Their conversation was interrupted by a sudden engine failure, requiring Acina to down the shuttle and abandon ship. Now stuck in the wilderness of Dromund Kaas, Empress Acina and the Commander were forced to contend with the planet's dangerous wildlife and lightning storms. The pair eventually discovered that their shuttle had been sabotaged by the GenoHaradan, whom the Empress had always assumed to be a myth. The legendary assassins proved no match for the Alliance Commander and the Empress of the Sith, however, as the pair shortly dealt with the assassins and located their camp. The Commander discovered from the camp's logs that the assassination attempt was organized by none other than Leontyne Saresh, the former Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, in a bid to take over the Alliance.
            When they came under heavy fire, Empress Acina and the Commander took shelter in a nearby Sith tomb. As the pair descended further into the tomb's depths, the Empress and the Outlander were confronted by a traitorous Minister Lorman, who was behind the shuttle sabotage, and a GenoHaradan strike team seeking to finish their job. After the GenoHaradan were dispatched, Acina offered the Alliance Commander to decide Lorman's fate. After the Alliance Commander returned to their headquarters on Odessen and dealt with Saresh, Acina contacted the Commander again with a formal offer on an alliance. Shortly afterwards, she pardoned the Imperial officer Malavai Quinn, who had been imprisoned by former Minister Lorman for defiance, and took him on as her advisor.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Acina</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAcina</string></dict>

        <key>Arihnda Pryce</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.530.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Arihnda Pryce was a human female who served as Governor of the Lothal sector fourteen years after the rise of the Galactic Empire. Prior to her rise to governorship, she was the manager of Pryce Mining, aide to Lothal Senator Domus Renking, manager of the Bartanish Four Sector citizen's assistance office, an employee at the Proam Avenue Citizen Assistance, and a member of the Higher Skies Advocacy Group. Pryce managed to secure the Governorship of Lothal by trading information about Higher Skies' espionage activities to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin.
            During her rise to power, Pryce forged an alliance with the Chiss Imperial Navy officer Thrawn, who later became a Grand Admiral. Once in office, Pryce outmaneuvered and engineered the downfall of her political rivals Governor Ryder Azadi and Renking. As Governor of Lothal, Pryce presided over the expansion of the Imperial military presence on Lothal, which became a major Imperial base in the Outer Rim Territories. Pryce was often absent and delegated the governing of her planet to several local ministers including Maketh Tua. The Imperial presence on Lothal attracted resistance from the Phoenix Cell, which was part of the growing rebellion.
            While rescuing her parents, Pryce played an important role in neutralizing the Batonn insurgency, leading to high civilian casualties. In 2 BBY, Governor Pryce solicited Grand Admiral Thrawn and his Seventh Fleet's services in ferreting out the Phoenix Group in the Lothal sector. She joined Thrawn and the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus in combating the rebel presence in the Lothal sector. Unknown to Pryce, Kallus was an undercover rebel informant known as Fulcrum. During the course of the insurgency, Pryce fought rebel insurgents, took part in an unsuccessful hunt for the rebel leader Mon Mothma, and took part in the Battle of Atollon.
            Eventually, Pryce fell out of Thrawn's favor when she destroyed the Lothal City fuel depot, killing Kanan Jarrus in the process one year prior to the Battle of Yavin. She later perished during the Liberation of Lothal, remaining loyal to the Empire to the end.
            Arihnda Pryce was a human[3] female[4] from the Outer Rim planet Lothal.[1] Arihnda was the daughter of Elainye Pryce and Talmoor Pryce. The family owned a mine on Lothal that was located on land shared by the former Governor Ryder Azadi. She grew up a quiet life, which she enjoyed as a child, watching the sunset and the laughter of children from all species and backgrounds playing.[1]
            But as Arihnda grew older, she begun to resent the quietness and dullness of the open spaces for lacking culture and excitement. Regarding Lothal as boring, Arihnda sought to escape to more cosmopolitan worlds, where excitement and bright lights existed alongside what she regarded as "sophisticated people." Her father Talmoor eventually discovered a source of doonium, a precious metal used in the manufacture of starship hulls and something valued by the expanding Imperial Navy. When Arihnda came of age, she inherited her father's mining company Pryce Mining.[1]
            When Arihnda was in her mid-thirties, the Governor Azadi sought access to Pryce Mining's doonium mines. He sent one of his staffers Arik Uvis to buy another 21 percent stake in the company, giving him a controlling interest. However, Arihnda rejected the offer. In retaliation, Governor Azadi's office framed Arihnda's mother Elainye for embezzlement. After learning the news from her father Talmoor, Arihnda visited the police station only to learn that her mother's bail request had been denied and that she had not been allowed to receive visitors. She later conferred with Talmoor and realized that Uvis was behind her mother's trumped up charges. In desperation, Pryce sought the help of Lothal's Senator Domus Renking.[1]
            Senator Renking agreed to to help Pryce's mother by shifting the blame onto the Lutrillian heavy equipment inventory operations manager Pomi Harchmak. To prevent Azadi from taking over the company, Renking persuaded Arihnda to sign over the rights of her company to the Empire. As compensation, he found Arihnda's parents new jobs as the assistant manager and foreman of the Creekpath Mining and Refining complex on the planet Batonn. Renking also secured Pryce a new job as a staff member at one his citizen assistance offices on Coruscant. With little choice, Pryce accepted Renking's terms and sold Pryce Mining to the Empire. Following the meeting, Pryce spent three hours remonstrating with her parents about the opportunity they were given while warning of the dangers if they refused. While she was helpless in the past, she convinced them that she would help them in the future. In the end, Pryce's parents agreed to leave their home and relocate to Batonn.[1]
            On Coruscant, Arihnda Pryce developed a reputation as a tough and effective civilian assistance officer who lobbied for the interests of Lothalian expatriates on the galactic capital. On one occasion, Pryce confronted the landlady Chesna Braker for neglecting to repair a leaking pipe in one of her tenant Daisie's apartment blocks. Following a tense argument, Braker reluctantly agreed to fix Daisie's leaking pipe after Pryce reminded her to comply with Coruscant laws and regulations.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Arihnda_Pryce</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemArihndaPryce</string></dict>

        <key>Iella Wessiri Antilles</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.532.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Iella Wessiri Antilles was a Corellian female, who served as a CorSec agent and, during the Galactic Civil War, a spy for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. She went on to become a member of New Republic Intelligence, and later married Wedge Antilles.
            Iella joined the Corellian Security Force in 1 BBY.[1] Later, she partnered with Corran Horn for two years,[1] acting as a mentor to the headstrong young officer, and also worked with veteran investigator Gil Bastra. Wessiri and Horn foiled several kidnapping attempts, including ones made on Siolle Tinta and Wynssa Starflare (although it wasn't until years later that they learned Starflare's true identity). After a harrowing raid on a glitterstim den, she and Corran nearly slept together. However, Kirtan Loor—the Imperial Liaison officer—took them in for debriefing, and when they saw each other again, the moment had passed.
            Corran learned that Kirtan Loor was planning to have them arrested on trumped up charges, so he, Gil Bastra, Iella Wessiri, and Iella's husband Diric Wessiri, made plans to escape. Corran escaped as Loor was planning on having him murdered. Diric and Iella Wessiri escaped to Coruscant.
            On Coruscant, Iella joined the Rebellion as an intelligence operative, sometimes performing deep undercover work for months at a time. In 7 ABY, she assisted Rogue Squadron in its undercover mission to retake Imperial-occupied Coruscant from Ysanne Isard's regime.[2]
            Iella and Diric were often separated due to work. Diric was in fact a sleeper agent, captured and brainwashed by Isard during his confinement on the hidden Imperial prison facility Lusankya. While Iella was escorting former Imperial Intelligence officer Kirtan Loor into Republic custody, the two were attacked by an Imperial assassin, who killed Loor before Iella shot him. Tragically, she realized it was actually Diric, who thanked her with his dying breath for releasing him from Isard's control.[1]
            She participated in the Bacta War by inserting herself to Thyferra along with Elscol Loro and her team to organize the local Vratix in toppling the Bacta Cartel. Under the the codename of Hook she helped perform many covert operations such as humiliating Aerin Dlarit by stripping him of his uniform and spreading holos of their deed. The planet was eventually liberated after the Battle of Thyferra.[3]
            In 9 ABY, Iella was able to exact justice by fatally shooting Isard during the Rogues' struggle with Imperial admiral/warlord Delak Krennel.[4]
            During the Rogues' mission to Coruscant, Wessiri and Wedge Antilles developed a deep mutual attraction. Though she admitted her love for Diric was not passionate, her sense of loyalty prevented her from pursuing a relationship with the Alliance hero.[2] Later, during the Zsinj campaign after Diric's death, the two began dating when duty assignments converged on Coruscant. Their relationship stalled out due to conflicting careers, only to reignite during a mission to bring the Outer Rim planet Adumar into the New Republic. Iella used the alias Fiana Novarr during this undercover mission. Her cover story was that of a Corellian slicer hired by the Cartann government to do interfaces between their set of computer protocols and New Republic and Imperial standards. Wedge proposed before their time on Adumar was over.[5]
            By the time of Luke Skywalker's marriage to Mara Jade, it was revealed the two had been married for some time and had two daughters, Syal and Myri.[6]
            Iella's career with New Republic Intelligence following the Adumar operation is so far undocumented. She retired after the Galactic Civil War, but, along with Wedge, came out of retirement during the Yuuzhan Vong War. She and Wedge both retired after the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar.
            In early 40 ABY, Iella, Wedge, and their youngest daughter, Myri, were living in Coronet City on Corellia. During her retirement, Iella began grooming Myri to follow in her footsteps as an intelligence agent. When tensions escalated between the Galactic Alliance and Corellia, Iella and her husband were forced to come out of retirement. Wedge openly sided with Corellia after a failed attempt by the Galactic Alliance to keep him out of the war.[7] Iella, on the other hand, continued to work as an intelligence agent.[8]
            Following Wedge's resignation from the Corellian military, Iella, Myri, Corran, and Mirax rescued him from several CorSec officers attempting to assassinate him. The group then fled to the Errant Venture, where they reunited with old friends. While on the ship, Iella and Myri worked as dealers in the gambling area in an effort to gather intelligence.[8]
            Iella began analyzing holonews and distributing her conclusions to Booster Terrik, Talon Karrde, her husband, and, when Wedge began working as his military advisor, Luke Skywalker. During the Battle of Centerpoint Station, she accompanied a Jedi strike team on the shuttle Reveille in infiltrating the Anakin Solo, and joined Han and Leia Organa Solo in rescuing Allana, while Luke, Saba Sebatyne, and Ben Skywalker provided a diversion for Jacen by attacking him on the bridge. She escaped with the rest of the strike team on the Millennium Falcon, piloted by Jagged Fel.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Iella_Wessiri_Antilles</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemIellaWessiriAntilles</string></dict>
        <key>Myri Antilles</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.533.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Myri Antilles, a Human female, was the second daughter of Wedge Antilles and Iella Wessiri Antilles.
            An intelligent and stubborn girl, she was named for her father's childhood friend Mirax Terrik Horn, whose nickname as a child was Myra. In 27 ABY, after the Battle of Coruscant, she and her older sister Syal were sent to The Maw for safety along with mainly Jedi children for the rest of the Yuuzhan Vong War.
            In 40 ABY, Myri was living with her family on Coronet, Corellia. She inherited Iella's inquisitive nature and affinity for intelligence activities, and, as of the Second Galactic Civil War, was being groomed by her mother to follow in her footsteps as an intelligence agent.
            After her graduation she was approached by both the Galactic Alliance and Five Worlds, she subsequently refused both offers deciding to do as her father had, and just stay out of the whole war, something that didn't happen as they were forced to blast their way off of Corellia when they noticed Han and Leia Solo and Lando Calrissian being chased after by the Corellian Defense Force. They escaped to the Errant Venture where Myri worked for tips as a card dealer in one of the Venture's casinos with her mother to gather information. The sheer amount of money that she was making caused her to rethink about joining the intelligence business albeit halfheartedly. She also correctly deduced that whoever was behind the conflict was secretly trying to split the Solo-Skywalker "alliance."
            Myri continued to gather intelligence during the course of the war while on board the Errant Venture getting rich gambling in the process.
            In 44 ABY, Myri was recruited to the reformed Wraith Squadron to expose and capture General Stavin Thaal as a member of the Lecersen Conspiracy. She contributed by disguising herself as a protocol droid, enabling her to get close to Thaal so she could swipe his blaster before he could kill his ex-wife Zehrinne and Colonel Kadana Sorrel when he, in his new identity as Thadley Biolan, was exposed as an "impostor".
            Guests of Dragon Con 2011 have reported that author Aaron Allston has confirmed Myri Antilles's role in his upcoming 2012 novel X-Wing: Mercy Kill: That of a member of Wraith Squadron.[2]
            In Mercy Kill she is described as having natural black hair, despite being first shown with blonde hair in Union.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Myri_Antilles</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemMyriAntilles</string></dict>

She was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor for her actions.
            Odavia Anaru was an A-wing pilot assigned to General Carlist Rieekan's ship Striking Distance during the Battle of Jakku. Anaru was among the starfighter escorts that accompanied the New Republic transports down to the surface of Jakku and guarded them while they off-loaded squads of commandos. Anaru circled above the battlefield, strafing Imperial positions and shooting down Imperial TIE fighters sent to oppose her.[1]
            During the battle, Anaru was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over the[1] Goazon Badlands.[2] Anaru ditched her mangled A-wing and sprinted for cover despite her injured leg. Stranded far from the New Republic commandos, she fought off Imperial stormtroopers with nothing but her standard-issue blaster pistol.[1]
            When the Empire deployed AT-ATs to protect its research facility, the walkers turned their cannons on the entrenched Republic commandos. Anaru, retreating to better cover, took a rocket launcher from a fallen trooper. Bracing the heavy weapon against a broken hull fragment, she took aim at the lead AT-AT, Hellhound Two, and fired. Despite stormtroopers rushing her position, Anaru didn't move, firing all six rockets at the AT-AT's weak points. While Hellhound Two crumbled, Odavia Anaru was not alive to see it. She was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor.[1]
            Anaru was a human female with light skin.[1]
            As a pilot of the New Republic, Odavia Anaru wore a green flight suit and helmet, while operating an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Odavia_Anaru</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemOdaviaAnaru</string></dict>

A member of the Bear Clan, she was one of its brightest members.
            After she was taken by a recruiter of the Jedi Order's Acquisition Division, Amithest was sorted into the Bear Clan upon her arrival. As she entered the academy at the Temple, she received her early education from her clan leader, Grand Master Yoda. During one of the clan's daily lightsaber instructional courses on the Temple's veranda, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi approached Grand Master Yoda with a question. It appeared the Temple's Archives were incomplete and missing a system. One of Amithest's peers, J. K. Burtola, suggested that someone had erased the files, thereby explaining the archives' incompleteness.[2]
            The Jedi hopeful Mari Amithest was portrayed by Phoebe Yiamkiati in Attack of the Clones.[3]

            Lesle Andreya served the Alliance to Restore the Republic as an agent for Alliance Intelligence under the leadership of General Airen Cracken during the Galactic Civil War. She was trained by the Rebellion's best espionage experts and knew all the "by the book" tricks. She was known to have been one of the top agents of her time, with information provided by Andreya allowing Alliance forces to avoid Imperial ambushes. However, around 7 ABY, Andreya's loyalties shifted and she began actively working against the Alliance's successor state, the New Republic.
            Andreya stole sensitive computer files containing defense plans and disappeared in the region surrounding Nal Hutta. The New Republic Intelligence Service believed that she obtained transport from there to an Imperial-controlled sector where they believed she was planning to sell the information to the highest bidder. The New Republic was curious as to her motives, cautioning agents looking for her that they would have to improvise given her knowledge of standard tactics. It was believed that she had family members in Mos Eisley; New Republic Intelligence indicated that beginning there was a good starting point for agents tracking her.
            Andreya hid her facial identity, and spoke with a trace of a Neree accent. She was not known to use violent means, relying instead on her persuasion skills.
            Andreya dressed in full body robes that concealed her features, and carried a hold-out blaster, knife, and fragmentation grenades.

        <key>Alecia Beck</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.541.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alecia Beck was a female human who served as a senior commander in the Imperial Security Bureau. In the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin, she was tasked with hunting down Lieutenant Caluan Ematt, a member of the enemy Alliance to Restore the Republic.
            Born a female human, Alecia Beck came to serve in the Imperial Security Bureau, the largest of the two intelligence agencies of the Galactic Empire. During her first tour with the ISB, Beck, then a mere lieutenant, caught her training officer selling secrets for credits. Although he was a full captain, Beck dared confront him in the maintenance bay aboard the Star Destroyer Vehement. The captain attempted to kill her, using a laser cutter he had found on a nearby workbench. The two then engaged in a fight. Beck managed to get the upper hand, although she lost her left eye in the confrontation. Consequently, Beck received a promotion and a commendation.[1]
            Around the time of the Yavin, Beck had been made a senior commander in the ISB, making her one of the few women holding high ranks in the Empire. She was tasked with hunting down the Shrikes, a special recon unit of the enemy Alliance to Restore the Republic. When word came out that the Empire's Death Star battle station had been destroyed by the Alliance in the Yavin system, all senior commanders of the ISB were ordered to move on their current targets immediately.[1]
            Beck and her men ambushed the Shrikes on Taanab. All Shrikes were killed, with the exception of their leader, Caluan Ematt, who managed to escape. Ematt got a burst transmission to the Alliance, letting his allies know of the Tanaab incident. Eventually, Beck and the ISB discovered that Ematt had made his way to Cyrkon, in Hutt Space. By capturing Ematt, Commander Beck hoped she would learn where the Alliance had relocated after the Battle of Yavin. The Vehement was positioned to block all flight traffic to and from Cyrkon, while Beck herself deployed to the surface, accompanied by four squads of white-clad stormtroopers. Upon searching the planetary starport, Beck identified the Millennium Falcon, a battered freighter that belonged to Corellian smuggler Han Solo, a known member of the Alliance. When Solo, Ematt and the Wookiee Chewbacca entered the docking bay that housed the Falcon, Beck and her men were waiting for them. However, Beck had underestimated the sheer audacity of Han Solo. The Corellian smuggler destroyed the magnetic shield that protected the docking bay from Cyrkon's polluted air. In the ensuing chaos, Solo, Chewbacca and Ematt managed to board the Falcon and escape.[1] Commander Beck gave a report on the situation to Admiral J. Ras-Teker, and immediately began to calculate their possible destinations, determined not to let Ematt escape her a third time.[2]
            During a mission to Vetine with Luke Skywalker, Alliance pilot Shara Bey impersonated Commander Beck in an attempt to infiltrate the secret Imperial labs there – however they were unaware that Beck was missing her left eye, and their cover was blown, forcing them to fight their way out.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alecia_Beck</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAleciaBeck</string></dict>

        <key>Amanoa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.543.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Amanoa was a Human female from the world of Onderon who was born in 4070 BBY. The daughter of a prominent nobleman, Amanoa enjoyed the wealth and privileges afforded to the Onderonian aristocracy, and eventually married into the planet's royal family as the wife of Onderon's King Ommin. The couple birthed a daughter named Galia, and together they lived in the royal palace of Onderon's capital city of Iziz. Amanoa's reign saw drastic changes in Onderon's role in the galaxy. Along with her husband, she was beguiled by the specter of the long-dead Dark Lord Freedon Nadd, to whom she became the Sith apprentice in her final years. As she and Ommin steeped themselves further in the dark side, both became masters of Sith sorcery, and used their magics to maintain rule over the Onderonian populace as dictated by four hundred years of tradition. When Ommin's health began to fail him as a result, Amanoa became the sovereign leader of Onderon, and imposed her will through the power of the dark side of the Force.
            Amanoa's allegiance to the spirit of Freedon Nadd brought her into direct conflict with the Beast Riders of Onderon's wilderness, exiled citizens who refused to submit to the oppression of the Sith. Against the suggestions of Nadd, Amanoa entered into a protracted war with the Beast Riders, and was eventually forced to request help from the Jedi Order in hopes of bringing a peaceful resolution to conflict. However, it was through her petition that Amanoa's clandestine activities under Nadd's tutelage came to light. She was defeated by Jedi Master Arca Jeth and his apprentices, and died when they drove the Dark Lord's influence from Iziz. When Amanoa's husband was killed in battle with the same Jedi two years later, the once-proud queen of Onderon was interred alongside him and their Sith Master in a burial temple on Onderon's jungle moon, Dxun.
            Amanoa was an Onderonian[6] and the daughter of a wealthy noble;[1] she was born in 4070 BBY.[2] When Ommin's father became one with the Force, Ommin took his rightful place as the king of Onderon and ruler of Iziz. The new King married Lady Amanoa as his queen and together they had a daughter named Galia. As a direct descendant of Freedon Nadd, King Ommin rose to power like his ancestors by dominating the citizens of Onderon with the power of the dark side.[1]
            Ommin and his ancestors hid their dark secrets well, and so Amanoa knew nothing about her husband's allegiance with the Sith for many years. One day, Ommin suddenly lost interest in mundane daily activities, as his training under Nadd's ghost had progressed considerably. Eventually Amanoa discovered the bond between her husband and the Sith. The queen tried to tear Ommin away from the dark teachings, a futile effort, for the blood of Nadd ran in Ommin's very body. Failing to help her husband, the frustrated Amanoa's depression turned into anger and outright hatred for the king. At that moment, King Ommin decided that his wife was ready to embrace the ways of the Sith and the teachings of darkness. The queen slowly fell to the dark side. Once Amanoa crossed the point of no return, she opened herself to the dark power. King Ommin and the spirit of Freedon Nadd taught Amanoa the ways of the Force and the techniques of the Sith, and together, the king and queen became powerful Sith sorcerers.[5]
            The love between Ommin and Amanoa faded during their quest for Sith knowledge. Mistrust, loathing, and outright hatred quickly filled the space where their love had once existed. Little did the pair know that Freedon Nadd was manipulating them both. The long-dead Dark Lord's ultimate goal was to physically resurrect himself. By teaching his descendants well, Nadd hoped to find a powerful candidate to study Sith alchemy and create a body to hold his spirit. To ensure that either Ommin or Amanoa would be powerful enough, Nadd manipulated them into competing with one another.[5]
            Soon after, Ommin lost control of his own body—the price he paid for the power of the dark side. A durasteel exoskeleton was built by the king's personal doctors to support his flesh and blood. As Ommin retreated from public to further his study of the dark ways, Queen Amanoa assumed the daily duties as the ruler of Onderon.[1]
            Apart from ruling Iziz, Amanoa sought to expand the Onderonian Sith cult as well. In Onderon's history, only the royal family had been allowed to practice the Sith ways. King Ommin had taken Minister of State Novar as an apprentice two years previous, and had taught his initiate well. Amanoa continued the training of Novar and gave him King Adas's Sith holocron, which she had discovered less than a decade earlier, after she had learned all of its secrets. Amanoa commanded Novar to expand their Sith cult, telling him to instruct the new recruits in the basic principles and philosophies of the dark side. Those who proved themselves worthy of advancement would then receive further training from the holocron.[2]
            At the same time, Nadd realized that the couple had failed him: Ommin himself would never be strong enough to fulfill Nadd's dream, while Amanoa would not further her study once her husband failed to compete with her anymore. Indeed, Queen Amanoa spent all her time focusing on the administration of Onderon, abandoning her dark side studies, and handing the running of her cult over to Novar.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Amanoa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAmanoa</string></dict>
        <key>Padmé Amidala</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.544.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Padmé Naberrie of Naboo (publicly known by her regal name, Padmé Amidala, and also known as Her Royal Highness, Queen Amidala of Naboo from 33 BBY to 25 BBY and as Her Excellency, Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo from 25 BBY until her death) was the younger daughter of Ruwee and Jobal Naberrie, and the sister of Sola Naberrie. Later in her life, Amidala became the secret wife of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and the mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo, two of the most important figures in galactic history. She was also the grandmother of Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo, as well as Ben Skywalker. This relationship made her great-grandmother of Allana Solo, Jacen Solo's daughter, and an ancestor of Nat, Kol, Cade Skywalker, and Ania Solo.
            Amidala was the democratically elected Queen of Naboo before representing the Chommell sector as a Senator in the Galactic Senate. As Queen of Naboo, Amidala fought bravely to liberate her people during the Trade Federation's invasion in 32 BBY, thus becoming one of the most respected political figures in the galaxy. In 22 BBY, following the Military Creation Act, Anakin Skywalker was assigned to protect her, and following the Battle of Geonosis, the two secretly married on Naboo after the pair fell in love.
            Senator Amidala participated in many events of the Clone Wars, both political and military, while also becoming pregnant to her husband. Around the end of the war, she doubted the motives of the Galactic Republic. In 19 BBY, appalled by the dissolution of the Republic and the creation of the Galactic Empire, she signed the Delegation of 2000 along with Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and other Senators.
            After Anakin slaughtered many Jedi, including younglings, Obi-Wan Kenobi came to tell Padmé about Anakin's transformation to the Sith Lord Darth Vader. She refused to believe him, and went to Mustafar to find her husband. Unknown to her, Kenobi had hidden aboard her ship in order to find his former apprentice. When Kenobi revealed himself, the newly christened Sith Lord assumed she had betrayed him, and he strangled his wife using the dark side, knocking her unconscious.
            After Kenobi defeated Vader, and left him for dead, he took Amidala to a medical facility on Polis Massa, where she gave birth to fraternal twins and named them—the boy, Luke, and the girl, Leia.
            Unfortunately, her husband's fall to the dark side had broken her heart, causing her to lose the will to live, which, coupled with the strain of giving birth to her children, resulted in her death. Before death took her, she spoke her final words to Kenobi, stating her strong belief that there was still good within Anakin. At her state funeral, thousands of Naboo gathered in the streets of Theed to pay their respects to their beloved former Queen and Senator.
            Throughout her relatively short life, she played a vital role in the politics and events surrounding the Clone Wars. Amidala and other Senators were responsible for creating the foundation for any chance of rebellion against the Empire. Eventually, Padmé's children would play a major role in the fragmentation of the Empire and the redemption of Anakin.
            Born Padmé Naberrie in 46 BBY,[10] Amidala was the youngest daughter of Ruwee and Jobal Thule Naberrie, and the sister of Sola Naberrie.[7] Padmé grew up in an isolated mountain village where her parents instilled in their children high virtues like self-sacrifice and care for the socially weak.[7] Her family moved to Theed when she was young, and Padmé attended the best schools available to her, enjoying occasional class retreats to Naboo's lake country. In her youth, she volunteered for the Refugee Relief Movement, like her father had before her, and journeyed to Shadda-Bi-Boran to aid in the relocation efforts of the natives. Sadly, many of these refugees died when they were unable to adapt to life on another world. Following this, she entered the Legislative Youth Program, where she met a young man named Palo. A brief, innocent relationship followed, but the pair parted ways when Palo became an artist, and Padmé continued in politics.[7] She never forgot her past or her heritage, however; even after she reached the top, Amidala still maintained her village's tradition of painting her thumb nail on each hand stark white, a small but notable sign of her dedication to her family.[11]
            Amidala's rise was meteoric—she had joined the Apprentice Legislature at age eight and became a full Apprentice Legislator by age eleven.[7] During this time, she first met Silya Shessaun, her workshop mentor. The two would meet again as Senators, and formed a close bond.[12] By 33 BBY, at the age of thirteen, Padmé Naberrie had become Princess of Theed, and was extremely popular, rallying those opposed to the rule of King Ars Veruna.[13][6]
            She became involved in a relationship with Ian Lago, the young son of Veruna's Prime Counselor, Kun Lago. Lago's father opposed the match, but it ended of its own accord when Veruna abdicated and Amidala accepted to enter the race to succeed the King.[14] Her bid for the throne had initially been suggested to her parents, and subsequently discreetly backed, by Senator Palpatine, who wished to see Veruna lose the election for his own reasons.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemPadmeAmidala</string></dict>
        <key>Aleema Keto</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.545.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aleema Keto was a Human female, the daughter of Lady Magda Keto and niece of the elder Lord Keto, as well as the cousin of Satal Keto. As she progressed down the path of the dark side of the Force, Aleema became a Sith sorceress, gaining proficiency in the arts of Sith magic. She and Satal also co-founded the Krath, a secret dark side society, and together they succeeded in overthrowing the Tetan Monarchy just prior to the Great Sith War.
            As co-rulers of the Empress Teta system, Aleema and her cousin instigated the Krath Holy Crusade, the opening battle of which revealed the measure of their Sith powers at work in Tetan space. The Krath then launched a bold ambush against the Jedi during a convocation on the planet Deneba, which resulted in the death of Jedi Master Arca Jeth. In response, his apprentice, the Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma, infiltrated the Krath in an attempt to destroy them from within. Aleema immediately realized his intentions and seduced him while offering him a position within the Krath organization. She then masterminded the death of her cousin Satal at Qel-Droma's hands, at which time the fallen Jedi assumed Satal's position as leader of the Krath.
            Together with Qel-Droma, Aleema joined forces with Dark Lord Exar Kun and held position as his senior ally in Kun's Sith Brotherhood. War was waged against the Jedi and the Republic, though during an assault on Coruscant, Keto betrayed Qel-Droma to the enemy. She was later killed by her own actions when she used her Sith powers to cause a massive supernova in the Cron Cluster during the Battle of Kemplex IX, having been tricked into the affair by both Kun and Qel-Droma.
            The daughter and son—though not siblings—of the then-rulers of Empress Teta, Aleema and her cousin Satal were next in line for the throne of the Empress Teta system. Bored and spoiled, she, Satal, and some of their aristocrat friends formed a secret society called the Krath, so named after a fairy-tale magician-god. The cousins learned much from their tutors about the ancient Sith Empire, which instigated the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY—so much so that they were compelled to explore the history further on their own.[8]
            The Keto children took a trip to the Galactic Museum on Coruscant in search of more knowledge on the Sith. In the museum, they perused a hall dedicated to Sith history and managed to steal a book of Sith lore, only to find that they could not understand the ancient text. Dejected, they went back to their hotel, and while scanning the news reports, heard about dark side adepts on Onderon who were terrorizing the populace with their dark powers.[1]
            Intrigued by this new knowledge, the pair traveled to the war-torn planet aboard the Tetan Royal Space Yacht known as the Krath Enchanter, with hopes of locating any Sith affiliate who might aid them in unlocking the secrets of the book. They arrived on Onderon to find a massive battle taking place between Galactic Republic forces and the Naddists, a cult following of the ancient Sith Lord Freedon Nadd. Their yacht was shot down in the midst of a Republic rocket-jumper deployment, and crashed in the Onderonian capital of Iziz, where they just barely escaped their exploding vessel into the streets. After spending some time showing their acquisition around and inquiring about the Sith, they were finally brought before Onderon's monarch, King Ommin.[1]
            Ommin was curious about these two potential Sith initiates and their ancient Sith text, and so agreed to help them. Satal openly expressed his apprehension, fearing that the old King did not possess the knowledge they sought. All that changed however, when King Ommin worked his dark magic on Satal, rendering him ill and opening Aleema further to the dark side. Ommin then showed them his prized collection of Sith amulets, one in particular that allowed them to read Sith writings. The decrepit King agreed to give Satal the amulet, but under one condition: Ommin must be allowed to take a copy of the spell book for himself. Satal acquiesced, and while a scribe transcribed the text, Ommin showed them the captive Jedi Master Arca Jeth, hung on a wall and suffering heavily under Sith magic. As Ommin leaned in close to taunt Jeth, a team of Jedi Knights crashed the royal palace to free him. Ommin was caught off-guard as his forces were soundly defeated by Jeth's rescuers.[9]
            The Jedi quickly triumphed, and just as Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma smashed Ommin's durasteel exoskeleton to incapacitate him, the ancient spirit of the Dark Lord Freedon Nadd appeared. With Republic forces and the Jedi Knights now in complete control of the city, Nadd realized Ommin had failed in his task of restoring the glory of the Sith; instead, the Sith Lord convinced Aleema and Satal that they held the key to building a new Sith Empire and that he would guide them. Eventually, the Jedi freed Arca Jeth, and Qel-Droma slew Ommin.[9]
            Aleema and Satal then fled Onderon with a collection of ancient Sith artifacts and texts and used them to become proficient in Sith sorcery. Now the way was clear for the Krath to immediately begin plotting their rise to power. Armed with her new Sith knowledge, Aleema was instrumental in bringing down their parents, the legitimate rulers of the Empress Teta system. During a visit to her uncle's carbonite processing facility, Aleema, along with Satal, caused an uproar when their escort, Korus, revealed that Aleema replaced his tongue with an Adegan eel. Reeling with confusion and anger, Lord Keto demanded that she and Satal be arrested. Aleema, however, stopped Lord Keto's guards by using her Sith talents to transform the guardsmen's weapons into illusory snakes.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aleema_Keto</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAleemaKeto</string></dict>

            For many years, Alinta and her allies communicated with Senator Bail Organa anonymously via a secret comlink by sending coded messages. During the Clone Wars, Alinta contacted Organa with crucial information regarding the Sith. The woman claimed that a planet called Zigoola posed a possible threat to the safety of the Republic. Organa, not knowing what to do with the information, called upon his fellow Senator and friend Padmé Amidala, who was good friends with the Jedi. Padmé convinced Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to listen to Organa's story. Reluctantly trusting Organa and his source, Kenobi and Organa set off to Zigoola. Alinta sent coordinates one at a time to Organa, as a precaution. When they group arrived at the last pair of coordinates, they found themselves at a space station. at first, it seemed as if the station were abandoned, but they soon found that a battle was in progress between Alinta's allies and the Karlarba Pirates.
            The pirates and their battle droids had already eliminated most of Alinta's allies, leaving her the last remaining of her group. Kenobi and Organa entered the fight and managed to defeat the remaining pirates and their droids, although Alinta was mortally wounded during the fray. She was too badly hurt to be saved by Kenobi's limited healing abilities, but the woman managed to give some information to them before she died. Alinta had one request of them before they left: blow up the station so no one would be able to retrieve any information. Organa and Kenobi received a data crystal with Zigoola's coordinates and scuttled the station to preserve the group's secrets.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alinta</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemAlinta</string></dict>

When the Alliance to Restore the Republic attacked Imperial forces in the Battle of Scarif, TK-4012 was one of several stormtroopers who confronted the rebel KX-series security droid K-2SO while he operated a console in order to aid his fellow rebels in recovering the Death Star plans from the tower's vault. During the shoot out with the droid, she fired a blaster bolt that impacted just over four centimeters from his programming process access door. Despite being able to visually identify TK-4012, K-2SO resisted the urge to download her personnel file and prepared for his inevitable fate, sending one last message to his friends and destroying the console before being destroyed himself. TK-4012 herself died soon after when the Empire's Death Star superweapon fired on Citadel Tower.[2]
            TK-4012 first appeared in the novelisation of the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was written by Alexander Freed and released on December 16, 2016.

        <key>TN-3465</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.549.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>TN-3465 was a human female TIE fighter pilot who served in the naval forces of the First Order. Following the Battle of Starkiller Base, she and her BB unit BB-K8 accompanied Captain Phasma on a mission to hunt down Lieutenant Sol Rivas for his alleged role in Starkiller Base's destruction. Their mission brought them to the remote, rocky and oceanic world of Luprora.
            There, TN-3465 and BB-K8 helped Captain Phasma to enlist the help of the humanoid Lupr'or colonists in attacking the R'ora's stronghold, where Rivas had been taken captive. This attack served as a diversion for Phasma to kill Rivas in order to conceal her role in lowering Starkiller Base's shield. TN-3465 learnt about Phasma's complicity in the superweapon's destruction. However, Phasma killed TN-3465 and destroyed BB-K8 in order to eliminate all "loose ends."
            TN-3465 was a First Order TIE fighter pilot who lived during the outbreak of the First Order–Resistance war.[3] Having grown up in the First Order, TN-3465 lacked a name and was only known by her call designation.[2] During the Battle of Starkiller Base, she was stationed inside an auxiliary hangar on Starkiller Base but had not joined the fight because a BB unit[3] named BB-K8[1] was performing a data update on her TIE/sf space superiority fighter. While attempting to hunt down Lieutenant Sol Rivas for his alleged role in lowering Starkiller Base's shields, Captain Phasma came across TN-3465 in the hangar and ordered her to help track down Rivas.[3]
            TN-3465, Captain Phasma, and BB-K8 departed Starkiller Base moments before the planet was destroyed by the stored stellar energy it had drained from a nearby star.[3] Under Phasma's orders, TN-3465 pursued Rivas' TIE/fo space superiority fighter through space. However, Phasma was unable to shoot Rivas down since BB-K8 had not yet finished repairing the ship's laser cannons. Running out of fuel, Rivas landed his fighter on the planet Luprora. Under Phasma's orders, TN-3465 tailed him but took care to avoid alerting him to their presence[2]
            After landing their TIE/sf fighter on Luprora, TN-3465 reported that Rivas' fighter was to the east. While traveling towards Rivas' TIE fighter, Phasma ordered TN-3465 to carry BB-K8 with straps since the globular droid was unable to navigate the planet's rocky surface. Arriving at the site, Phasma determined that Rivas had been captured by some kind of unknown creatures. The two then sought shelter at an abandoned dwelling where they changed out of their First Order uniforms into civilian clothes. While TN-3465 removed her helmet, Phasma wore a helmet with a red visor to hide her identity. To maintain her cover, TN-3465 adopted the nickname "Pilot" while Phasma called herself "Captain."[2]
            Sighting a nearby settlement, TN-3465, Phasma, and BB-K8 waded through a lake. However, they were attacked by a giant tentacled Tsw'ell monster, which dragged Phasma below the surface. TN-3465 was also hit by a tentacle and sank underwater while unconscious. Captain Phasma used a knife to hack through the creature's tentacles, killing it. TN-3465 and her team managed to reach the other side where they were met by a group of humanoid Lupr'or, who had colonized Luprora centuries before.[2]
            TN-3465 found that her superior Captain Phasma was able to understand the natives, who spoke a variation of Lupre'en. The First Order visitors were hosted by Jair'i, the leader of the Lupr'or peoples. Jair'i informed his guests that the Lupr'or were the descendants of offworld migrants who had abandoned technology in favor of a lifestyle based on farming and fishing. However, rising sea levels and a deteriorating climate had eliminated the small land they once farmed. The Lupr'or also came under attack from the monstrous Tsw'ells and an indigenous alien race known as the R'ora. TN-3465 and Phasma learnt that Rivas had been taken captive by the R'ora.[2]
            Jair'i sent the Lupr'or guide Dar'en to show TN-3465 and Captain Phasma the R'ora stronghold in an attempt to convince the offworlders of the futility of the task of rescuing Rivas. They found that the stronghold was an island surrounded by a lake, populated with Tsw'ells.[2] While Phasma studied the situation, TN-3465 remarked that she wished that their fighter's weapons were still functional so that they could blast the stronghold from their air. Phasma responded that the two of them would have to find another way.[4] The group would spend four days on the planet.[1]
            Returning to the village, Phasma questioned a young Lupr'or girl about where she had gotten her necklace. The girl led Phasma, TN-3465, and Dar'en to the home of her great-grandmother Ali'ane, who revealed that she had gotten the necklace from an old Lupr'or starship, which she labeled the "soul killer." Ali'ane's great-granddaughter agreed to lead the offworlders to the site of the ship in return for not telling the elderly woman.[4]
            For several hours, TN-3465, Phasma, Dar'en, and Ali'ane's great-granddaughter climbed up a mountain. During the journey, TN-3465 grumbled about climbing rocks and vowed never to leave her ship again. Phasma told TN-3465 to speed up and not to grumble so much, prompting an apology. The Lupr'or girl led them to a wrecked Lupr'or ship, which rested on a high summit. TN-3465 and Phasma agreed that the contents of the ship would be sufficient for their plan.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/TN-3465</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemTN3465</string></dict>
        <key>Cindel Towani</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.550.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cindel Towani was a female Human journalist during the time of the New Republic. In 3 ABY, when she was five standard years of age, the Towani family's starcruiser crash-landed on the forest moon of Endor. Soon after, her parents, Jeremitt and Catarine were abducted by the native Gorax, leaving Cindel and her teenage brother Mace to fend for themselves. The two children were found by the Ewok Deej Warrick and taken to live with his family in their village. After learning that Jeremitt and Catarine were being held in the Gorax's lair in the Desert of Salma, the Towani children enlisted the help of the Ewoks and set off to rescue their parents. After a long journey, the group reached and defeated the Gorax and the Towani family were reunited.
            The Towanis remained with the Ewoks while Jeremitt worked to repair their ship, and Cindel became friends with Deej Warrick's youngest son, Wicket. Later that year, however, the Ewok village was attacked by a group of Sanyassan Marauders led by King Terak and the Dathomiri Nightsister Charal. Jeremitt, Catarine, and Mace were all killed defending the Ewok village, but Cindel was able to escape with Wicket. Towani and Warrick were eventually taken in by another stranded Human, an old man named Noa Briqualon, and his companion Teek. Towani was subsequently kidnapped by the Sanyassans, who believed that she held the key to their escape from Endor, but Briqualon, Warrick and Teek rescued her from Terak's Keep. Pursued by Terak's forces, the group joined up with the other Ewoks and managed to defeat the Sanyassans and kill Terak.
            Following the battle, Towani and Briqualon were able to leave the Endor moon using the power cell of the Towani family's starcruiser to repair Briqualon's starship. Towani traveled the galaxy with Briqualon for some time before he retired in the Mid Rim. Towani settled on Coruscant and became a journalist with The Life Monitor. During the Black Fleet Crisis in 16 ABY, a news story in which Towani leaked information about the Yevethan attack on Polneye helped garner public support for New Republic intervention.
            The Human female Cindel Towani[2] was born in 2 BBY,[1] the youngest child of Jeremitt and Catarine Towani. She had an older brother named Mace, who was nine at the time of her birth.[8] She and her family came from a planet which had, by her own admission, no "furry creatures," and she was therefore unfamiliar with such creatures.[5]
            In 3 ABY,[9] while traveling through the Moddell sector on their way home, Towani's family starcruiser crash-landed on the moon Endor.[4] Though all members of the family survived the crash, they found themselves stranded on the forest moon. Jeremitt and Catarine were concerned for their children's well-being in the unfamiliar forest and forbade them from leaving the ship and the protection it provided. One day, when Jeremitt and Catarine left to search for a transmitter, the Towani siblings left the ship and went to explore the forest. They returned to find no sign of their parents, unaware that Jeremitt and Catarine had been captured by the giant Gorax creature.[5]
            The two children were forced to forage for their own food[4] but, with their parents' life monitor signals indicating that they were still alive, they stayed with the crashed ship and waited for their parents to return. Some time later the local Ewok Deej Warrick and his sons Weechee and Willy came to investigate the crash site. The Ewoks found Towani hiding inside the ship but Mace, fearing that they may have been responsible for his parents' disappearance, attacked the Ewoks, threatening them with a blaster. He was soon overpowered by the Ewoks, and they led both children back to their village, where it became clear that they intended no harm.[5]
            Not long after arriving at the village, exposure to the strange environment[4] started to take its toll, and Towani complained that she felt unwell. Mace assumed she was merely hungry, but it became clear that it was something more serious when she lost consciousness. Fortunately for her, the Ewoks were aware of a fluid secreted by a tree in the forest which they had used as medicine for generations. The small amount they had available was enough to revive Towani, but she was still in pain and suffering from a fever. The Ewoks, together with her brother, made a trip to the forest and retrieved more medicine, but the children would have to stay with the Ewoks while Towani rested and recovered her strength.[5]
            During their stay with the Ewoks, Towani became friends with Deej's youngest son, Wicket, and even taught the young Ewok some words in Basic. Towani found their stay with the Ewoks reassuring, providing her with some stability in the absence of her parents, whose disappearance she could not understand and whom she feared dead. However, Towani's brother was eager to return to the ship in the hopes of finding their parents. While the Ewoks slept, Towani was woken by her brother and the two children ran off into the forest.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cindel_Towani</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanFemCindelTowani</string></dict>
