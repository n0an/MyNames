The river Amasenus blocked his path, and, fearing for the child's welfare, Metabus bound her to a spear. He promised Diana that Camilla would be her servant, a warrior virgin. He then safely threw her to the other side, and swam across to retrieve her. The baby Camilla was suckled by a mare, and once her "first firm steps had [been] taken, the small palms were armed with a keen javelin; her sire a bow and quiver from her shoulder slung."[2] She was raised in her childhood to be a huntress and kept the companionship of her father and the shepherds in the hills and woods.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla_(mythology)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>MythRomanFemCAMILLA</string></dict>

The Augustan poet Ovid conflates her with another archaic goddess named Carna, whose festival was celebrated on the Kalends of June and for whom he gives the alternative name Cranê or Cranea, a nymph. Ovid's conflation of the goddesses is likely to have been his poetic invention,[1] but it has also been conjectured that Carna was a contracted form of Cardina,[2] and at minimum Ovid was observing that their traditions were congruent.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardea</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>MythRomanFemCARDEA</string></dict>

Her seven-day April festival of Cerealia included the popular Ludi Ceriales (Ceres' games). She was also honoured in the May lustratio of the fields at the Ambarvalia festival, at harvest-time, and during Roman marriages and funeral rites.
            Ceres is the only one of Rome's many agricultural deities to be listed among the Dii Consentes, Rome's equivalent to the Twelve Olympians of Greek mythology. The Romans saw her as the counterpart of the Greek goddess Demeter,[4] whose mythology was reinterpreted for Ceres in Roman art and literature.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(mythology)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>MythRomanFemCERES</string></dict>
