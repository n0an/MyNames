        <key>Elcho Kressh</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elcho Kressh, also known as Kressh the Younger, was the son of the Sith Lord Ludo Kressh. The senior Kressh began to fear for his son's safety as his rival, Naga Sadow, levied for the Sith Empire to wage the Great Hyperspace War against the Galactic Republic. To this end, Kressh designed a device to protect his young son from all harm, allowing him to only be touched should he will it.
            As the Hyperspace War escalated, Ludo deigned that, to further protect his prospect, he would have his son take refuge outside the Stygian Caldera on a remote Star system, safe from the Republic and Naga Sadow's machinations. Once word had reached Elcho of the fate of his father and that of the Sith Empire, he began to devise a counterattack against the Republic with what few resources he had at his disposal. During the years of buildup to his strike against the Republic, Elcho Kressh amassed a massive army made from dozens of systems worth of pirates and those who had a grudge against the Republic in secret. He used an array of bribes and deals allowing said groups to keep their autonomy but fight under his banner.
            On the eve of his invasion of the Republic to retrieve his and his father's honor, he was denied his revenge after suffering from a ruptured stomach after overindulging in alcohol, celebrating the very attack he would never attend. Soon after, the massive force behind the movement dispersed as all of the deals were based on personal contracts and relationships Elcho himself engineered. Without Elcho, everything fell apart and the counter-attack never occurred.
            Sometime during his self-exile, Elcho created a holocron of his teachings, which later was found by Sith Lord Mandragall and influenced Sith war-time strategy for generations to come during the New Sith Wars.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Elcho_Kressh</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascElchoKressh</string></dict>

His intelligence and highly developed survival skills compensated for his underwhelming stature, and allowed him to rise high in Sith society. When lord Scourge arrived at Darth Nyriss's home, there was immediate animosity between them, which resulted in plotting against each other.

        <key>Sek'nos Rath</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.3.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sek'nos Rath, called Seki by adoring females, was a male Sith Je'daii Ranger who served the Je'daii Order on Tython at the height of the Infinite Empire's reign. He was a bold Je'daii who was fond of weapons and longed to achieve the greatness of the Je'daii of myth and stories. He was also known to be gregarious and a ladies man. Determined to remain in the Balance and become a warrior of legend, Rath suffered several great betrayals and torture during the Force Wars which saw him give in completely to the dark side of the Force.
            A Force-sensitive Sith, Sek'nos Rath was the child of Je'daii diplomats stationed in the Tython system. Rath was raised by his maternal grandmother, Miarta Sek and his paternal grandfather, Thok Rath on the planet Tython, one of nine planets which made up the Settled Worlds. He learned healing techniques from his grandmother and looked up to his grandfather for his many past adventures. He eventually attained the rank of Je'daii Journeyer and began traveling between the nine Great Temples of Tython. In his quest for forging the perfect weapon, Rath spent a large amount of time at Vur Tepe learning from Tem Madog, the Temple Master of the Forge. Under the tutelage of Master Madog, Rath forged three Force-imbued blades in his quest for perfection.[1]
            Twelve years after the Despot War, a conflict between the Order and Queen Hadiya of Shikaakwa, Rath spent part of his time from his Great Journey at Qigong Kesh in the Silent Desert attempting to master the power of Force lightning. While showing off for three flirtatious Je'daii girls, Rath tried to accomplish the never-before-seen ability of making a ball of lightning, when he apparently received a powerful vision from the Force. Simultaneously, a mysterious man named Xesh, a Force Hound of the Infinite Empire crashed the Rakatan ship called the Devourer near the Rift on Tython. The surge of deaths associated with the crash alerted all Je'daii to the foreign presence on the world, as well as stirring a Force storm that would rage across the entire planet.[2]
            Distracted by the vision of Xesh, the lightning Rath had created arced back at him, which caught the attention of his grandparents. Shooing the girls away, the older Je'daii chided young Rath for using abilities which only used dark emotions for fear he would fall out of balance. Departing the temple to seek out the man from his vision, Rath took his mount to the Rift on the continent of Talss where he met fellow Journeyers Shae Koda and Tasha Ryo, both of whom had experience similar visions. Watching as an alien ship crashed down into the Rift, the trio searched the wreckage and discovered an escape pod carrying the stranger known as Xesh.[2] Drawing their swords, the Je'daii were shocked as Xesh's weapon easily cut through their steel blades. Despite the loss of their weapons, the three Je'daii's mastery of the Force outmaneuvered Xesh and Koda was able to take the Forcesaber from his grasp. Unarmed and winded, the Je'daii forced Xesh deeper into the Rift towards the dangerous Abyss of Ruh.[3] While tracking the Force Hound, the three Je'daii experienced hallucinations brought on by the dark energies inside the Abyss. After Rath was able to calm his two partners, the trio was able to locate Xesh as he battled a saarl. Rath sent a boulder into the creatures head, which only antagonized the beast; the group was forced to flee deeper into the cave. Making a final stand, Rath and his allies attempted to hold off the beast but were unable to turn on the Forcesaber she had confiscated from Xesh. At Rath's insistence, Koda relinquished possession of the saber to Xesh in hopes that he would activate it and kill the saarl; however Xesh took the weapon and abandoned the Je'daii to their fate. Unknowing to the journeyers, Xesh stayed behind to watch them fight, believing that in the end they abandon each other to the saarl. To his surprise, none of them did. Xesh then spontaneously aided Shae against the saarl, ultimately killing it. Rath was thrown unconscious while protecting Tasha from the saarl, but later recuperated at Mahara Kesh. He and Koda were present when Ryo looked through some of Xesh's memories, and when the Temple Masters voted to exile Xesh to Bogan, Rath and the other Journeyers argued against it, claiming that Xesh should stay on Tython to learn balance. However the masters rejected their objections, and sent Xesh to Bogan.[4]
            Later on, the trio of Je'daii Journeyers were sparring under the tutelage of Master Tave at Stav Kesh to take their minds of Xesh and their frustration with the Council's decision to exile him. Gently reprimanded by Tave for dwelling to much in the dark side emotions of doubt and anger, he warned them that the Council had made a decision based on the resources available to it and that they should trust the Masters' decision.[5] Summoned by Master Tem Madog to report on the Forcesaber at Vur Tepe, Rath joined Journeyer Koda and Rangers Hawk Ryo and Rori Fenn in discussing the attributes of the alien weapon. Comforting Koda when she was reflecting on the dark side energies needed to power the weapon, Rath reminded her that her parents had given their lives for the safety and future of Tython and that she should take comfort in that heroic deed.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sek%27nos_Rath</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascSek'nosRath</string></dict>

        <key>Marka Ragnos</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.6.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Marka Ragnos was a male half-breed Dark Lord of the Sith who lived during the time of the first Sith Empire, born long before 5100 BBY, and, around that same year, dueled Sith Lord Simus for the title of Dark Lord of the Sith and control of the Sith Empire. Ragnos defeated Simus, who was beheaded in the battle with the other aspiring Dark Lord. Ragnos lived for over a hundred years, growing in power, pitting his adversaries against each other and ensuring that there were no threats to his throne. Following his death shortly before the Great Hyperspace War, two powerful Sith Lords, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, fought each other to occupy his throne; Ragnos' spirit appeared before them and proclaimed that only the most worthy should succeed him.
            Ragnos lived on as a Force ghost after his death, trapped within the confines of his tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban. A thousand years later after his death, Exar Kun summoned Ragnos from his grave, through the use of talismans, crowning Exar Kun as the new Dark Lord, and Ulic Qel-Droma as Kun's apprentice, as an attempt to resurrect the lost empire thousands of years prior. Thousands of years after the Sith Empire, during the New Republic era, the Dark Jedi Tavion Axmis made an attempt to bring Marka Ragnos back from the depths from the Force, using an old Sith artifact, known as the Scepter of Ragnos in order to siphon the Force from many Force Nexuses all spread across the galaxy, empowering the Disciples of Ragnos. Tavion's goal to resurrect Ragnos almost succeeded, but her operation was overthrown by the Jedi Jaden Korr, defeating Ragnos' spirit, and enclosing him in his tomb once again, where he was dragged back in the depths of the Force.
            A Sith-Human hybrid,[4] Marka Ragnos was a direct descendant from a Dark Jedi who had fled the Republic after the Hundred-Year Darkness,[4] who lived 20,000 years after the formation of the Old Republic.[7] Feared, obeyed, and admired among the Sith,[8] Ragnos was considered to have been the greatest Dark Lord of the Sith of his age, and was born a long time before 5100 BBY.[9] When the Dark Lord of the Sith died, Ragnos and another powerful Sith, Simus, rose up to take the mantle. A formidable warrior, Ragnos dueled and defeated Simus in combat circa 5100 BBY, proving himself worthy of the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith.[2]
            After gaining the mantle of a Dark Lord, he led ruthless campaigns against his Sith enemies,[10] pitting his adversaries against each other and ensuring that there were no threats to his throne.[8] His iron-fisted rule would last over a century.[2][10][11]
            During those times Ragnos likely composed his own epistle,[12] created a Scepter capable of siphoning the Force from many different places, which could be used to empower non-Force users,[3] and designed a pair of gauntlets capable of augmenting the strength of the Force in its user.[8]
            Years later, Ragnos was encountered by a young boy named Tenebrae, when he was thirteen years old. The boy had come before Marka Ragnos, the Dark Lord of the Sith and the ruler of the Sith Council and Sith Empire during those times, hoping to gain training under Ragnos. When Lord Ragnos met Tenebrae, he was impressed by the youth's power and ambition, and named him the ruler of Medriaas, bestowing on him the rank of Sith Lord and the name Vitiate.[1]
            After years of his rule, Marka Ragnos passed away in year 5000 BBY.[2] His death was marked as the end of a golden age of the Sith Empire, despite its reluctance to continue expansion.[2]
            Ragnos' legacy lived after his death. The Ragnos Lakes, on Kesh, for instance, were named after him. During his funeral on Korriban, two Sith Lords, Sadow and Kressh emerged as favorites to succeed Ragnos as the next Dark Lord of the Sith and the two engaged in a duel of Sith swords, after a disagreement as to who would better serve the Empire as Dark Lord. Ragnos' spirit appeared before them speaking of a great past and an uncertain future for the Sith Empire, proclaiming that only the most worthy would succeed him.[6] After the duel, Naga Sadow was elected as the new Dark Lord of the Sith.[6]
            After the inconvenient arrival of Gav and Jori Daragon, Sadow had an excuse to invade the Republic, claiming that those Galactic Explorers would try to bring Republic reinforcements in an effort to invade the Sith Empire soon enough.[6]
            Vitiate did not join in the struggle for succession after Ragnos' death, nor was he involved in the conflict between Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, or the Great Hyperspace War.[6] Instead, he decided to stay hidden, until the right time arrived.[1]
            After Naga Sadow's election as the new Dark Lord of the Sith,[6] further events led to a major war with the Galactic Republic.[6] Ultimately, because the schism was never healed it spelled the end of their interstellar empire.[13] Ragnos lived long after his death as a Force ghost, trapped within the confines of his own tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban.[3][8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Marka_Ragnos</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascMarkaRagnos</string></dict>
        <key>Ravilan Wroth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.7.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ravilan Wroth, nicknamed Rav by Captain Yaru Korsin and the "crimson man" by the Keshiri, was a male of the Sith species. He served as the quartermaster and keeper of the Massassi warrior contingent aboard Omen, a Sith dreadnaught that was intended to participate in the Great Hyperspace War effort led by the Dark Lord Naga Sadow. When the starship crash-landed on the planet Kesh after a collision with its sister ship, Harbinger, Wroth was among the survivors. The Massassi who had survived the crash and remained under Wroth's care began to die rapidly upon exposure to the planet's atmosphere. When the Massassi were all dead, Wroth was left without his title of quartermaster. After meeting with a native woman named Adari Vaal, the Sith were brought into contact with the Keshiri people. Using their appearance, technology, and power in the dark side of the Force, Wroth and the other Sith quickly subjugated the native people, who believed them to be the Skyborn deities of Keshiri legend.
            Fifteen years later, Wroth occupied a series of jobs for Yaru, who had become the Grand Lord of the Sith Tribe on Kesh, including that of spokesperson of the Fifty-seven Red Sith of Sith species descent. Since their arrival on the planet, none of the Red Sith offspring had survived past their first day, leading to concerns about their continued existence on the planet, and more pressure for the Red Sith to get off-world. In a last attempt to focus efforts on escape, Wroth and the Fifty-seven purposefully caused a plague in the village Tetsubal on the Ragnos Lakes. The resident Keshiri were killed, and crisis broke out amongst the Sith after they found a Human among the victims. The situation worsened as reports of deaths in other villages around the Ragnos Lakes filtered in. Although Wroth himself was secretly behind the deaths in Tetsubal, the outbreaks elsewhere had been the design of Yaru's wife, Seelah Korsin, who had learned of Wroth's duplicity and sought to frame him and his people to rid herself of them once and for all. To that end, she convinced Yaru to authorize a purge of every Red Sith on Kesh—which included Wroth. As the spokesperson of his fellow Fifty-seven Red Sith, Wroth was captured and subsequently tortured by Seelah, who revealed her role in the event and her part behind the deaths of all of the Red Sith children. The life of the last Red Sith on Kesh was then ended as Seelah's son, Jariad Korsin, struck him down on Seelah's orders.
            Ravilan Wroth was a male of the red-skinned Sith species and a native of the Sith Empire during the Great Hyperspace War of 5000 BBY.[2] During this time, the position of Dark Lord of the Sith had been vacated by the late Marka Ragnos, whose passing also brought an end to the Sith Empire's Golden Age. Two opposing Sith Lords, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, stepped up to take his place as Dark Lord.[3] Wroth was a supporter of Sadow,[2] whose expansionist ambitions were opposed by the conservative views of Kressh, who was content with the long-enjoyed stability of the Sith Empire in its secluded area of space and sought to maintain it in its wealthy state.[3] Though it was undecided who was to become the Dark Lord of the Sith, Sadow maneuvered himself into position to gain the title. The Empire split into factions under Kressh and Sadow as a result, and the latter assembled his followers and made plans for galactic conquest. With a newly assembled invasion fleet, Sadow invaded the Republic.[4]
            During the Hyperspace War, Wroth was assigned to the Sith dreadnaught Omen.[5] He served aboard Omen for some time, long enough to have shared several missions alongside its captain, Yaru Korsin, with whom Wroth fenced on occasion. Omen's permanent crew was comprised of Human descendants of exiled Tapani nobles, and Force-sensitivity was introduced into their bloodlines over the years as they interbred with the Dark Jedi outcasts of the Hundred-Year Darkness who had interbred with the Sith after 6900 BBY.[2][3]
            Wroth was still aboard Omen when Sadow dispatched it—along with another ship, Harbinger, under Captain Saes Rrogon—to search for Lignan ore for use during the upcoming battle at Kirrek against the Jedi and the Republic. The mining flotilla, including Wroth and the rest of Omen's crew, along with Harbinger, gathered at Primus Goluud, where miners were recruited to carry out the task Sadow had set for them. The Massassi were stationed aboard both ships as commandos, and Wroth took the position of quartermaster of the Massassi aboard Omen.[2] The mining flotilla eventually found Lignan deposits on Phaegon III's largest moon[6] and mined it for the valuable ore, but as Harbinger and Omen finished and readied to leave, a Jedi starfighter attacked them. With the first priority to protect the cargo of Lignan crystals, Wroth and rest of Omen's crew made preparations to go into hyperspace. Before they could jump, Harbinger started producing nonsensical sensor readings and began to move toward Omen, on a collision course. However, Omen's navigator managed to engage the hyperdrive, sending Omen into hyperspace. Despite his efforts, Omen did not completely avoid colliding with Harbinger, and the ship was knocked off course slightly as a result. The warped physics of hyperspace combined with the collision as they entered it caused terminal damage to the ship. Contact with a gravity well in hyperspace caused the shielding to fail and the bulkheads to give way, and the armory was completely removed by a seismic tug, taking a large portion of the quarterdeck with it.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ravilan_Wroth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascRavilanWroth</string></dict>
        <key>Tenebrae's adoptive father</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.8.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>A Sith male was the adoptive father of Tenebrae and was a farmer[1] on the northern continent[3] of the planet Medriaas, an agriworld on the edge of the Sith Empire. The farmer married a woman who was a red-skinned Sith like himself[1] around 5113 BBY,[2] and he believed that Tenebrae, the child she bore not long into their marriage, was his. However, the man was outraged when Tenebrae began to exhibit signs of Force-sensitivity[1] in 5107 BBY,[2] as neither he nor his wife had power in the Force. When he confronted his wife, she confessed that Tenebrae was the result of an affair with Lord Dramath, the Sith ruler of their world, but Tenebrae fed off of the man's anger and telekinetically broke his adoptive father's neck when the man attacked his mother. The Sith Lord Darth Nyriss explained the story of Tenebrae's father over a millennium later to her fellow Sith Scourge while describing Tenebrae's history.[1]
            Tenebrae's adoptive father was first mentioned in Chapter 15 of Drew Karpyshyn's 2011 novel The Old Republic: Revan.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tenebrae%27s_adoptive_father</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascTenebrae'sadoptivefather</string></dict>
        <key>Praven</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.9.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Praven was a Sith pureblood male who served the reconstituted Empire as a Sith Lord and later protected the Galactic Republic as a member of the Jedi Order. Trained as a Sith Warrior by Darth Angral, Praven participated in the attack on the Jedi Temple on the Republic capital of Coruscant at the end of the Great Galactic War in 3653 BBY. In the subsequent Cold War, Praven took on Angral's son Tarnis as his own apprentice and trained the Human as a Sith Lord, but Praven's training was not enough to prevent Tarnis' death at the hands of a young Jedi Knight when Tarnis attempted to unleash the Planet Prison superweapon against Coruscant near the end of the Cold War. Angral's pursuit of revenge drove him to dispatch his apprentices across the galaxy in order to steal other Republic weapons projects, and Praven acquired the Shock Drum weapon on the planet Tatooine after defeating the Jedi Master Bela Kiwiiks.
            However, Praven's sense of honor caused him to disobey his Master and challenge the Jedi Knight to a duel instead of destroying Tatooine with the Shock Drum, and the Knight was able to convince the Sith Lord to abandon the dark side and become a Jedi. Finding a new purpose as a Jedi Padawan, Praven learned the ways of the light side and gladly joined the Republic Military in defending the planet Corellia during the Battle of Corellia when the Galactic War broke out with the Empire. Under the leadership of the instrument of his redemption, the Jedi Knight now known as the Hero of Tython, Praven and the rest of the Jedi reinforcements foiled the plans of the Sith Emperor and prevented the Dark Jedi Tol Braga from killing thousands of civilians.
            A male member of the Sith species, Praven was born into a family that took pride in the purity of its heritage.[2] He was found to be Force-sensitive early in his youth and underwent training in the use of the dark side of the Force while also becoming adamantly loyal to the Sith Empire and its Emperor. A true believer in Sith philosophy who developed his own code of personal honor, Praven also developed an intense hatred of Jedi,[4] and the Sith Warrior was taken on by the powerful Sith Lord Darth Angral as his Sith apprentice[1] sometime before the end of the Great Galactic War with the Galactic Republic.[4] Under Angral's tutelage, Praven achieved the rank of Sith Lord himself and in turn took on Angral's own son, Tarnis, as his apprentice; Praven's student soon became a Sith Lord in his own right.[1]
            In 3653 BBY,[5] Praven was among the Sith who participated in a bold attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant. During the fighting, Praven engaged the Jedi Master Usma, one of the Jedi Order's most celebrated lightsaber duelists, in combat, and their duel ended when the Sith Lord killed Usma. However, Praven spared Usma's Padawan before telling her to seek him out once the Jedi had completed her training so that the two could face each other as equals.[4] Praven also killed a Republic soldier whose son, Fir Megsan, would later set a bounty on the Sith's head in an attempt to gain revenge.[6] In the days that followed the Sacking of Coruscant, as the battle came to be known, the Republic was forced to sign the Treaty of Coruscant, which ended the Great Galactic War and called for the immediate withdraw of Republic forces from battlefields across the galaxy.[5]
            Robbed of his chance to destroy the Republic, Angral spent the subsequent Cold War weaving complex plots to bring about his enemy's destruction[7]—one of which sent Tarnis on an undercover mission as Doctor Eli Tarnis, a scientist in the Republic superweapon initiative. Praven's former student quickly became the head of the Planet Prison project, while Angral took on two more apprentices, Sadic and Nefarid.[1] Praven gained a reputation among the Imperial Military after an encounter with an Imperial major ended with the man's death: Praven was insulted by the lack of respect that the major chose to show him and choked the officer with the Force, demanding an apology before breaking the man's neck as punishment.[7] Sometime during the Cold War, Usma's Padawan tracked down Praven as he had told her to, and the Sith Lord obliged her by sending the woman to the same fate as her Master.[4] During his time as a Sith, Praven encountered the immortal Lord Scourge, the Emperor's Wrath, who served as the Emperor's personal executioner.[3]
            In 3643 BBY,[8] Tarnis seized control of the Planet Prison project and set it up in the ruins of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, intending to use it against the Republic capital while he made his escape. Praven was with Angral, Sadic, and Nefarid at a secret Imperial facility on Ord Mantell when Tarnis contacted his father and relayed via holographic transmission the success of his plans to evade his Jedi and Republic pursuers. Praven's former apprentice also sent his father copies of files on all of the Republic's superweapon projects, but the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a young Jedi Knight and the Padawan Kira Carsen. Sadic mockingly reprimanded Tarnis for failing to tie up loose ends, but Angral urged his son to strike down his enemies, and Praven watched with the others as Tarnis engaged the two Jedi in a duel—a battle that ended in Tarnis' death. A furious Angral declared undying hatred for the Knight on account of that, and Praven promised his Master that he would personally kill the Jedi.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Praven</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascPraven</string></dict>

Ikoral survived many battles and trials, even earning the notice of the Sith Emperor himself, which Ikoral claimed was proof of pureblood superiority. It was said that he was so devoted to purity that he would not even tolerate alien slaves in his household.
            Around 3712 BBY, Ikoral convinced the Dark Council to allow an expedition to search for pureblooded Sith outside the Empire, hoping to find Sith who fled Korriban after the Great Hyperspace War who had not made the journey to Dromund Kaas with the Sith Emperor. When Ikoral failed to return from his quest, he was celebrated as a martyr; for decades his name was synonymous with determination and sacrifice in the Sith Empire.
            The truth, however, was that Ikoral had indeed succeeded in his search. During the Cold War, Darth Ikoral returned with thousands of pureblood Sith. But the Empire had changed much in Ikoral's seventy-year absence. Appalled by the Empire's peace with the Republic and sickened by the appearance of aliens in the Sith ranks, Darth Ikoral led his fellow purebloods to cleanse the galaxy by force of violence.
            The response to Ikoral's quest was the dispatching of a strike team to eliminate him. After boarding his flagship, the Red Reaper, the strike team found Ikoral in his personal sanctum and engaged him in combat. The attackers soon found out that he had experimented on the purebloods and increased his power. The strike team, however, ultimately proved more powerful and killed Ikoral at the behest of Darth Malgus.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Ikoral</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascDarthIkoral</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Igrol</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.14.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Igrol was a Sith pureblood who became a Dark Lord of the Sith and served on the Dark Council of the reconstituted Sith Empire. He ascended to the twelve-member ruling body sometime between 3984 and 3974 BBY, and by the year 3954 BBY, he had served on the Council longer than any other member besides Darth Xedrix. Igrol resided on the planet Dromund Fels instead of the Empire's capital of Dromund Kaas, though he was summoned to the Imperial Citadel with eight other Dark Councilors in 3950 BBY for a meeting with the Sith Emperor. The Emperor promptly killed the Dark Councilors mere hours before his Imperial Guard purged the remaining three, including Darth Nyriss, because five of the Councilors had participated in a conspiracy against the Emperor.[1]
            Darth Igrol was first mentioned in Drew Karpyshyn's 2011 novel The Old Republic: Revan, as one of the three members of the Dark Council at the time who receive a name.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Igrol</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascDarthIgrol</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Tormen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.15.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Tormen was a male pureblood Sith Lord during the Cold War. He was one of the Sith commanders of the covert Imperial attack on Corellia.
            Sometime during the Great Galactic War or the Cold War, the Sith Lord Fatalissar declared a Kaggath against Darth Tormen. Tormen was within arms' reach of Fatalissar at the time, and when Fatalissar declared the arena to be Ziost, Tormen immediately decapitated his still-speaking opponent.
            During the Cold War, Tormen invited the latest Champion of the Great Hunt to his flagship, the Tyrant after the bounty hunter was framed by the Republic for a list of false crimes. He was annoyed when the Hunter refused to be disarmed by the welcoming party and killed them in self-defense. Cutting to the chase, he offered the Hunter not only a substantial sum, but the chance for revenge against the two individuals responsible for the framing: Jedi Battlemaster Jun Seros and Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus. But as the two were on Coruscant, beyond the Hunter's reach, they would need to lure them away from the Republic capital. His plan centered around Corellia, whose government chose to secede from the Republic but a significant resistance refused Imperial rule. But before they could proceed, Tormen assigned the Hunter to chase down the two main obstacles that threaten to hinder his plan: Zale Barrows on Belsavis and General Thelonia Redrish on Voss.
            After the Hunter was successful with both targets, Tormen recalled the Hunter to his flagship just as he was finishing up the Rabaan campaign. However, Republic Special Forces assaulted the Tyrant. The attack was swift and Tormen and most of the crew were sealed off in different sections of the ship. The Hunter was able to fight off the Republic forces and regain control of the ship. Tormen soon executed the surviving bridge crew after learning that the captain was dead.
            Turning his attention back to the Hunter, Tormen explained his plan to lure in both Seros and Janarus. If Corellia was conquered, the Republic would send in military forces. But if the planet were to secede from the Republic, their enemies would be forced to try diplomacy. The Hunter would track down the three high-ranking resistance leaders, whom Tormen would force into agreeing to sign a compact. As Corellia was officially declared to be under Imperial rule, Janarus would have no choice to but to journey to the founding planet of the Republic to ratify the treaty, but not before Seros convinced him he could rally the Green Jedi to strike back. Tormen was confident that Seros would take to the battlefield instead of acting through proxy as he previously did with the Hunter.
            Once all the pieces fell into place and the secession treaty was signed, Tormen then dispatched the Hunter to eliminate Seros and retrieve his personal effects, which also contain Janarus' itinerary. Tormen stayed behind at the Corellian legislature to await a strike team of Green Jedi Seros sent to rescue Tormen's captives and tear up his sham treaty. Tormen easily slew them all. He then decrypted Seros' datapad and instructed the Hunter on how to board Janarus' flagship.
            Darth Tormen was a Sith with a single passion: war. Unlike many of his fellows, he had no interest or patience for intrigue, politics, ideology or self-indulgence, but that wasn't to say he was not a thinking man. Tormen would simply rather have all the pieces laid out before him. It is not enough that his enemies should be merely defeated, but forced to submit.
            Some had mistaken Darth Tormen’s dislike of subterfuge for a sense of honor or respect for his enemies. Those who have crossed him knew the reality–he took his only satisfaction from engaging his enemies directly and ruthlessly crushing them, no matter how outmatched he seemed to be. In spite of this, he was willing to accept an asset being largely independent should they ultimately been willing to serve him.
            Tormen also had little patience for failure, such as when he Force-choked the surviving bridge crew after his flagship was attacked or Corellia's prime minister for failing to bring his planet to heel.
            Darth Tormen used a single-bladed Sith lightsaber. He was a powerful user of the dark side, capable of telekinesis and Force rage.
            The player can either choose to accept Janarus' offer to kill Tormen in exchange for immunity (light side choice), or deliver him dead or alive to Tormen (dark side and neutral choices respectively).
            In Game Update 5.9: Nathema Conspiracy, if the player had killed Tormen, his apprentice, Lord Vindis, joins the Order of Zildrog to avenge Tormen and claim the title of Darth, only to end up as a sacrifice to awaken Zildrog.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Tormen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascDarthTormen</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Vowrawn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.16.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Vowrawn was a male Pureblood Dark Lord of the Sith and one of twelve to serve on the Imperial Dark Council in the times of the Great Galactic War.
            Darth Vowrawn had at least one apprentice, an ambitious Sith Lord named Qet. To honor his master, Qet brought in a massive army of slaves to secretly build a great statue of Vowrawn in the jungles of Dromund Kaas - an edifice that became known as the Unfinished colossus.[2]
            During the Galactic War, Vowrawn was one of the members of the Dark Council that opposed the ascendance of Darth Baras. This was especially the case after Baras claimed to have held the title of Voice of the Emperor. Vowrawn in this time had learned that Darth Baras was greatly aided by the prophetic words of a Force being known as the Entity that was kept chained under powerful enchantments on Corellia. Thus, he concluded that the only way to defeat Baras was freeing this dark spirit.
            During the restart of hostilities with the Galactic Republic, Vowrawn was in charge of Imperial efforts on Corellia, where he managed to hide his presence within the Incorporation Islands. He was protected by a cadre of Sith loyal to him in this time as he watched for assassins that were being sent by Baras. It was during this time he came into contact with Baras's former Sith apprentice, the new Emperor's Wrath and believed that the Sith was part of his enemy's plot to assassinate him. The Wrath was forced to fight through Vowrawn's retainers and kill Sith Lord Haresh, before Qet stood alone against him as the last line of defense. Vowrawn then revealed himself, seeing that the Wrath was much stronger than any of his followers and ordered Qet to stand down. He then requested that the Wrath not grant him the indignity of decapitation. The Wrath insisted to having been sent by the Emperor's Hands, not Baras, to protect him. Vowrawn remarked that nothing else could be gained by maintaining the deception, unless the Wrath was truly no longer in league with Baras. It was only after the Sith defeated the real assassin that Vowrawn was convinced of the Wrath's sincerity of being Baras' enemy. What's more, Vowrawn believed that the two of them together could dethrone Baras, much to the Wrath's delight. He then confessed his true motive behind leading the Corellia campaign - significant and vulnerable pillars of Baras' his bid. One agent held secrets to use as leverage, the other led Jedi in campaigns against Sith who defied Baras. If they were to "disappear", then Baras' support would be withdrawn. Vowrawn gave the Wrath the identity of the first spy, who was posing as Colonel Senks of the Corellia resistance. His stronghold in Labor Valley contained a myriad of escape tunnels, but Vowrawn passed the Wrath pulse disruptors that would lock Senks' secret passages so that he could be cornered and killed, though Vowrawn expressed regret that the Empire would lose a valuable agent. After arriving at the Wrath's ship, Vowrawn contacted his ally via holo, advising that if Senks wouldn't hand over his files, the Wrath should destroy his database to eliminate it all. After the deed was done, the Wrath had to leave the compound to avoid Baras eavesdropping on them.
            After the Wrath dealt with Senks, Vowrawn sends the Wrath to Axial Park, where his operative Shadow had gone to ground as Republic artillery bombarded the area. Shadow was supposed to provide the identity of Baras' Jedi spy. But upon meeting the Wrath, Shadow admitted that while he did not know the spy's identity, knew the location of the Jedi Enclave in the area. But while the Wrath fought through the Enclave to reveal the spy as Master Injaye, another unknown assailant made an attempt on Vowrawn, but with more fury than the last one. Vowrawn was impressed with how the Wrath's companions looked death in the eye and did not flinch.
            Vowrawn later rejoined the Wrath in a safehouse at the Capitol Square to free the Entity. However, Lord Draahg ambushed them before Vowrawn could begin releasing her bounds, imprisoning the Dark Councilor in a death field that threatened to disintegrate him. The Wrath was able to finally kill Draagh and to free Vowrawn. Once freed, Vowrawn confessed that he expected to die. Before performing the ritual to free the Entity, he had her confirm that Baras was viewing what had transpired through her, guessing that he must be twisting with fury.
            With Baras severely weakened, it was the time to finally expose him as the false Voice. Returning to Korriban, Vowrawn, arriving "fashionably late", authorized the Emperor's Wrath's entry into the Dark Council Chambers in order to ensure the final confrontation between Master and apprentice. Vowrawn urged his fellow Dark Councilors to stay their hand as they were all victims of a ruse perpetrated by Baras. In turn, Baras tried to make a desperate attempt out of greed or jealousy and called on the Dark Council to assist him in destroying his former apprentice, promising that the Emperor have informed him of Vowrawn's fate. Nonetheless, the Dark Council acknowledged the Wrath being supported by Vowrawn and allowed the Emperor's Wrath to duel Darth Baras and slay him, thus ending his plans to attain ultimate power in the Sith Empire. Relieved to be rid of his rival, Vowrawn, speaking on behalf of the Council, declared that the Wrath had free reign and answerable only to their ultimate Master.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Vowrawn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascDarthVowrawn</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Arkous</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.17.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Arkous was a Sith male Dark Lord of the Sith and a member of the Sith Empire's ruling Dark Council during the Galactic War against the Galactic Republic.[3][5] As a veteran in the Great Galactic War, and a strong Imperial loyalist that planned the Assault on Tython. It was later revealed that Arkous had an ulterior motive for the attack on Tython: the retrieval of a Rakata artifact. Since the Korriban Incursion, Arkous was reported to have an interest in a shipment of Isotope-5 from Makeb.[3]
            In 3638 BBY, Darth Arkous summoned an Imperial strike team to assist in the Empire's assault on Tython. Officially, he claimed it would be a crippling blow against the Republic and the Jedi. Unofficially, he dispatched Lord Goh to recover Rakata technology hidden within the Jedi Temple. The attack on Tython was to coincide with Colonel Rian Darok's attack on Korriban, which also hid Rakata technology. When the Empire received word of the attack, Arkous sent the strike team to retake Korriban to keep up appearances, while at the same time, the Republic retook Tython. Arkous attempted to reestablish contact with Goh only to learn that a Republic strike team had killed him. Following the reclamation of Korriban, Arkous gave praise to the Imperial heroes.
            Arkous later rendezvoused with Darok on Manaan. Together, they journeyed to an underwater base to meet with a Selkath geneticist named Gorima, to find a way to graft the Rakata technology onto test subjects to create invincible supersoldiers for the Order of Revan. However, Arkous' former assistant Lana Beniko, having collaborated with SIS agent Theron Shan, sent a strike team after them. When they confronted Gorima, Arkous and Darok were watching from an observation room. With Gorima's experiments having successfully made the grafting procedure non-lethal, the two conspirators made their escape, leaving a depth charge to destroy the facility and send their enemies to their deaths, unaware that Shan was present to rescue them before the facility could reach crush depth.
            Arkous later sent a coded message to Lana, explaining that he was planning on recruiting her to the Revanites, but his plans changed when she met her new allies. He warned her not to interfere with his plan, cryptically stating that the Revanites are everywhere. Lana and Shan tracked Arkous and Darok to Lehon (or "Rakata Prime", as it was then known), the former capital of the Rakatan Infinite Empire, where the Revanites had salvaged fragments of the destroyed Star Forge for Gorima to advance his experients in the building of an "Infinite Army". The Republic and Imperial pursuers, joined by the vengeful Wookiee smuggler Jakarro and his protocol droid "partner" C2-D4, confronted Arkous and Darok on the roof of the Temple of the Ancients, and killed them, despite Shan's hopes that they be taken alive for questioning. However, it soon became clear that neither Arkous nor Darok were the leader of the Revanites, but followers of the true master of the Order of Revan. The master was soon revealed to be Revan himself.[2]
            Lana Beniko was declared a traitor to the Empire and charged with murdering Arkous, a fact she could not contest due to the influence of the Revanites, and was forced to go underground with Shan and Jakarro.[2]
            Darth Arkous was an extremely powerful Dark Lord of the Sith. He was of noteworthy skill in lightsaber combat and he was also capable of using Force choke.
            Darth Arkous was also capable of using telekinesis and has demonstrated prowess in the use of Force lightning.
            Arkous first appeared in game update 2.7 of the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, released by BioWare in 2014. Arkous later made a reappearance in the "Depths Of Manaan" Flashpoint, as part of game update 2.9. Arkous makes his final appearance in game update 2.10. He, along with Darok, makes up the final boss fight for the "Legacy of the Rakata" Flashpoint.
            He is only accessible through the Forged Alliances Flashpoint series for all players in the game.

        <key>Ffon Althe</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.18.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ffon Althe was a male Pureblood Sith Acolyte  who served the the Sith Empire during the Cold War against the Galactic Republic. After Althe was brought to Korriban, Overseer Harkun presided over Althe's initial Sith training in the ways of a Sith Inquisitor on behalf of Lord Zash, who was looking for an apprentice.
            Althe was afforded unfair advantages by Harkun, who believed the elevation of Force-sensitive members of the Empire's slave caste was harming the Sith cause. Despite this favoritism and his Sith blood, he was bested by a competing acolyte and executed by Lord Zash.
            Protégé of Overseer Harkun, Althe was given every advantage possible, and despite that and his considerable ability he was outperformed by a fellow Acolyte, who was slave caste and eventually favored by Lord Zash.[2] During his training, Ffon was many times asked by Harkun to showoff his powers and scare the other acolytes. In one of these times, he even executed his fellow acolyte, Gerr with a burst of Force lightning.[1]
            For his final trial he and his fellow Acolyte were sent into Naga Sadow's tomb to bring back a map to present to Lord Zash. Harkun, eager to give Althe every advantage possible, gave him a head start. Unfortunately for Ffon, Zash arrived shortly thereafter and briefed the remaining Acolyte on information regarding the tomb's contents she had only just discovered. Zash saw no reason to recall Althe to give him the same information, since he had been shown favoritism from the start, and not from her.[1]
            Althe failed his final task while his slave-caste peer succeeded, with the help of the ancient Dashade servant of Tulak Hord, Khem Val. Not willing to give up, Harkun took the map off the acolyte and gave it to Althe, demanding he take credit for retrieving it. When the Pureblood acolyte presented the map to Zash, she was skeptical in believing Althe's apparent success. Instead she demanded the truth. In fear of Zash, Althe came clean and apologized for lying, but was still promptly executed by the Sith Lord. As Ffon died, Zash chided Harkun for his favoritism, speculating that Althe would have won if all the Acolytes had been treated fairly – or if she had not been the one they'd been competing for.[1]
            Ffon Althe was capable of Force lightning powerful enough to badly injure fellow acolyte Gerr.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ffon_Althe</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascFfonAlthe</string></dict>
        <key>Dramath</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.19.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dramath was a male Sith Lord of the Old Sith Empire, who ruled over the planet Medriaas in the years before the Great Hyperspace War. Possessing little ambition and content to live a hedonistic life ruling his own fief, Dramath unwittingly gave rise to one of the greatest evils in galactic history when one of his many illegitimate children turned on him and condemned Dramath – and ultimately Medriaas – to oblivion.
            According to legends circulating among the Sith at the time of the Old Sith Wars, Lord Dramath had a son, Tenebrae, with one of his subjects, a poor farmer's wife. Upon learning of Tenebrae's existence, Dramath ordered his mother to drown her newborn but his mistress secretly defied him. Years passed and when Tenebrae's stepfather, having figured out the truth of his wife's affair with Dramath when Tenebrae manifested Force-sensitivity (as neither he nor his wife were Force-sensitive), attempted to attack his wife, Tenebrae snapped his stepfather's neck. The young Sith then tortured his mother before eventually killing her. Dramath utterly ignored Tenebrae until his son was the age of ten, then confronted Tenebrae to decide whether he should execute or enslave the boy. Unfortunately, as Dramath discovered to his horror, Tenebrae had already surpassed him in power. Tenebrae killed Dramath, whereupon Marka Ragnos recognized him as Lord Vitiate of Medriaas, which Vitiate renamed "Nathema". Some years later, following the Sith's defeat in the Great Hyperspace War, Vitiate initiated a dark ritual that consumed all life on the planet, rendering it devoid of the Force, and making Dramath's illegitimate son effectively immortal. Vitiate would go on to declare himself the Emperor of a revived Sith Empire, and eventually and secretly developed the Eternal Empire with himself as the Eternal Emperor Valkorion.
            With none left on Nathema to remember him and all records of the planet purged to keep his dark deeds a secret, nobody suspected that Dramath was not entirely dead. Vitiate had in fact kept his father's spirit within in a powerful holocron and tortured him for over a thousand years, keeping the holocron in a secret vault beneath a structure called the Sanitarium, the only habitable structure on Nathema. As the centuries wore on, Dramath, in a twisted sense, became the closest thing Vitiate had to a confidante.
            In the year 3630 BBY, Valkorion's vault was opened by the Outlander, Lana Beniko and the Anomid scientist Jarak to escape a death fog that Valkorion's daughter Vaylin had unleashed whilst attempting to undo the damage Valkorion had done to her mind. The Outlander investigated the holocron and released Dramath, who related his story and connection to Valkorion to the Outlander and Beniko. He told the pair to take the holocron, stating that it would help destroy Valkorion, and asked to be freed from his torment.
            Although the holocron resisted Beniko's best efforts to understand exactly what it actually did, the Outlander was able to use the holocron in the final confrontation with Valkorion, enabling Dramath to have some hand in ending the menace Tenebrae had become.
            Dramath is first mentioned in the 2011 The Old Republic: Revan novel and later makes his first appearance in the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion.
            In Chapter VII: Into The Void of the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion, Lord Dramath appeared when the player and Lana Beniko discovered the holocron. Dramath asked to be released from his torment, but Beniko suggested that they keep Dramath in the holocron in case he had more information on Valkorion.
            The player can choose to free Dramath and allow him to pass on, earning light side points and disapproval from Lana. Alternatively, the player can choose to keep Dramath bound to the holocron, earning dark side points and Lana's approval. The latter option will allow Dramath to verbally spar with Valkorion and act as a temporary companion in Chapter IX: The Eternal Throne. Since no other companions are available during the fight with Vaylin's spirit, Dramath's presence makes the fight much easier. Dramath will sacrifice himself to weaken Valkorion directly, but the Outlander will gain assistance in the next phase.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dramath</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithMascDramath</string></dict>
