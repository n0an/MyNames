        <key>Argalia Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.1.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Argalia Baratheon, née Durrandon, was the daughter of Argilac the Arrogant, the last of the Storm Kings, and wife of Orys Baratheon, the founder of House Baratheon.
            Argalia Baratheon was the wife of Orys Baratheon, the first Lord Paramount of the Stormlands and is the distant ancestor of King Robert Baratheon and his brothers Stannis and Renly.
            Orys, a commander in the army of Aegon the Conqueror and his bastard half-brother, had been sent by Aegon to seize Storm's End, the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings and capital of the Stormlands. Orys defeated King Argilac the Arrogant and took not only Storm's End but also his sigil - the black stag and his words, "Ours is the Fury" - as well as Argalia, to cement his rule over the Stormlands. He became the first Lord Paramount of the Stormlands.[1]
            She is mentioned in Orys Baratheon's entry in The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[2]
            A sample chapter posted on April 17, 2014 to George R.R. Martin's website from the unpublished The World of Ice and Fire, a companion book to the A Song of Ice and Fire novel series, reveals that Argilac's daughter was named Argella Durrandon. Argilac offered Argella's hand in marriage to Aegon the Conqueror himself in return for a military alliance against King Harren the Black of the ironborn, whom Argilac feared was planning an attack on the Stormlands. Aegon refused, instead offering the hand of Orys. Argilac spurned the offer of a bastard and severed the hands of Aegon's envoy in protest.
            When Orys defeated Argilac at the Battle of the Last Storm, Argella declared herself the Storm Queen and vowed to fight on. Her own vassals refused to obey, instead delivering her to Orys naked and in chains. Orys treated her with courtesy and they later married. While Orys is reported to have treated her chivalrously, Argella's feelings towards Orys remain unknown.
            The name of "Argalia" is the creation of Bryan Cogman, who wrote the entries in the Lineages and Histories book.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Argalia_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemArgaliaBaratheon</string></dict>
        <key>Armeca</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.2.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Armeca is a prostitute working in the brothel owned by Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish in King's Landing.
            Armeca is a prostitute working in a brothel in King's Landing owned by Lord Petyr Baelish.
            She is "tutored" by the newly-arrived Ros, while Petyr lectures them on the art of seduction.[1]
            She continues to work for Lord Petyr Baelish and feigns that she cannot speak the Common Tongue to appear exotic to her customers despite being from Flea Bottom in King's Landing itself. Ros is aware of her using this ploy and calls her a "dumb slut." She is present at Lord Baelish's brothel when the gold cloaks, led by Lord Janos Slynt, appear to find Mhaegen and kill her daughter Barra, one of the late King Robert's bastard children.[2] When Ros is too upset to work because of this incident Lord Petyr assigns her customer to Armeca, who has only just finished performing oral sex on one of her own. Petyr mistakenly calls her "Aremca".[3]
            Armeca is in the Red Keep entertaining Bronn immediately before the Battle of the Blackwater. She admires his broken nose and asks how many times he has injured it. He tells her as he publicly undresses her. Their time is cut short by the arrival of Sandor Clegane, who antagonizes Bronn. They face off against one another but are interrupted when the bells sound a call to arms.[4]
            Armeca is the second character (after Ros) created specifically for the television series and does not appear in the novels.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Armeca</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemArmeca</string></dict>
        <key>Anya Waynwood</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.3.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lady Anya Waynwood is the head of House Waynwood, a powerful vassal house of House Arryn.
            Lady Anya, along with Lord Yohn Royce and Ser Vance Corbray, sits on a tribunal convened to investigate the alleged suicide of Lysa Arryn. She is dismissive of Petyr Baelish's explanations, noting in particular that Lady Arryn was devoted to her son to such an extent that she would never end her life. The tribunal then summons Littlefinger's niece, Alayne, the only other witness. Lady Anya refuses to allow Littlefinger to speak with Alayne first and, upon her entry, offers to dismiss Baelish so she can give her testimony without fear. Lady Waynwood is surprised to learn of Alayne's true identity, but agrees that even without her aunt, she is safe in the Vale. When Sansa breaks down after her testimony, Anya embraces and comforts her. Satisfied with Alayne's testimony, Waynwood and Royce discuss the Vale's next move with Baelish. He suggests that it is long past time that Robin left the Eyrie and conducted an official tour of the Vale.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lady Anya Waynwood, the Lady of Ironoaks, is a widow and the mother of Morton, Donnel, and Wallace Waynwood. She's described as having greying hair, loose skin beneath her chin, and crows-feet around her eyes, but also a distinct air of nobility. She's present in the High Hall of the Eyrie, surrounded by her sons, when Tyrion Lannister demands a trial by combat to prove his innocence of the charges against him.
            Lady Anya Waynwood, Lord Yohn Royce and more nobles from the Vale come to the Eyrie not to inquire about Lysa's death, but to remove Littlefinger from his office as Lord Protector and take Robin to foster at Runestone. However, Littlefinger is unimpressed by their threats and manipulates them to let Robin stay under his care.
            Lady Anya's wards include the young Harrold Hardyng, the heir-presumptive of the Vale, to whom Littlefinger intends to wed Sansa. He presuades Lady Anya (by buying up the debts of her house) to give her premission to the betrothal.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Anya_Waynwood</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemAnyaWaynwood</string></dict>
        <key>Amaya</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.4.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Amaya was a recently freed slave and former partner of Beskha. Following Daenerys Targaryen's liberation of the city, she was the de facto leader of a group of pit fighters in Meereen.
            When Beskha was still a slave, she and Amaya were very successful pit fighters, often working together. However, that friendship ended when Beskha won her freedom, which led Amaya to hold a grudge against Beskha for leaving her behind.
            When Amaya first sees Beskha she tells the Pit Fighters to restrain her, and tells Asher Forrester that he must want something pretty bad to come to them for it, but if he wanted her interest he wouldn't have come with Beskha.
            She believes Beskha abandoned her by escaping from their Master. Amaya notices that Asher caught the Pit Fighters' attention and says if he wants to lead them he must first earn their respect and must defeat Bloodsong to do just that.
            Amaya says that he must fight with the weapons they give him. When Asher puts Bloodsong down she throws Asher's sword so he can finish Bloodsong. If he kills him Amaya and the Pit Fighters are impressed.
            When Asher and Beskha wait at the ship for any pit fighters to join them, Amaya shows up along with the Beast, Bloodsong (if spared) and several other nameless pit fighters.
            When they reach Westeros, Beast complains that it is ugly and small, Amaya adds that it's freezing too. She manages to get out of the courtyard before the Whitehill soldier sabotages the gate, and after one of the Forrester brothers stayed behind she is seen going with the others to Ironrath.
            In the event Rodrik was rescued from the Ambush at the Harbor, Amaya and her pit fighters begin to openly show distrust to Rodrik and doubt over what was promised to them by Asher in Meereen. The situation worsens when Amaya and her group appears in Ironrath, who not only considers on sacking the castle but even warns Rodrik that the house was too unprepared for the coming battle. Despite initial shortcomings, Amaya leads the pit fighters during the Battle of Ironrath, where she assaults the Whitehill camp as Rodrik and Beshka go after Lord Whitehill and/or Gryff. As Rodrik returns to the meeting location, Beskha does not return and Amaya explains that "Basilisk" will have to take care of herself.
            Upon returning to Ironrath, Amaya leads a charge against the Whitehill army and is pleased that her group was finally fighting the battle as Asher had mentioned. But as the battle wages on, Amaya is killed by Whitehill archers that infiltrated the walls, along with other pit fighters.
            If Asher survived the ambush, Amaya and the other pit fighters help Asher and the Ironrath soldiers take down some of the Whitehill soldiers they encountered at the harbour. They then return to Ironrath and witness Asher becoming the new Lord of House Forrester. When Lord Whitehill arrives at Ironrath ordering the Forrester's surrender, Amaya tells Asher to reject the offer so they can battle the Whitehills. Instead, the Forresters decide to trick Ludd into thinking he's won so that they can lure him into Ironrath and kill him. Amaya supports the Sentinel's plan to ambush Ludd in the Great Hall, and is against Beskha's suggestion of poisoning his wine. It is up to the player to choose which method to use.
            Amaya is later seen seated with the other pit fighters in the Great Hall while the Forresters make their attempt against Lord Whitehill's life. When the plan is successful or is exposed, she and her pit fighters begin killing the Whitehill soldiers. If Ludd escapes, she clears Asher's path and tells him to not let Ludd escape, allowing Asher to throw an axe into his shoulder. The Battle of Ironrath begins, and Amaya leads her pitfighters in a charge against the Whitehills along with Asher and the Ironrath soldiers. Amaya is killed in the battle after being stabbed by a spear and hit by an arrow.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Amaya</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemAmaya</string></dict>

            Anara is a prostitute living in Braavos. She practices her trade in the same brothel as Lhara and Brea.
            Anara is shown to Ser Meryn Trant after Brea is dismissed for being too old for Meryn's tastes. Even though the madam states Anara is the most expensive of the establishment's girls and assures Meryn she's worth the price, Meryn discards her, finding even her too old. This makes the madam realize with some distaste what Trant is after.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there's no mention of a character named Anara.

            Dorea Sand is the seventh of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the "Sand Snakes". Her mother is Oberyn's paramour, Ellaria Sand.
            Oberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to Queen Cersei Lannister.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Dorea's story is the same. She is eight years old.
            After prince Doran hears the plans that the three elder Sand Snakes have in mind to avenge their father, he orders to arrest them lest they ignite a war with the Lannisters, and their younger sisters too (except Sarella), fearing that the young Sand Snakes may be used by others in plots against him. Dorea is sent to the Water Gardens alongside her mother and her three sisters, where she uses a morningstar to knock oranges from trees. Following the arrival of Ser Balon Swann, Doran releases Dorea, her mother and sisters.
            In Arianne's first sample chapter from the sixth novel, it is mentioned Dorea remains at the Water Gardens while her mother travels with her sister Loreza to Hellholt.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dorea_Sand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemDoreaSand</string></dict>

            Dorna is a member of House Swyft of Cornfield, daughter of Ser Harys Swyft, the head of the house. She married Ser Kevan Lannister, younger brother of Lord Tywin Lannister. Her husband's niece, Cersei Lannister, insisted that her husband, King Robert Baratheon, make Dorna and Kevan's son, Lancel, his squire. [1]
            King Robert insults Lancel, calling his mother a whore with a fat arse. [2]
            Dorna's two youngest sons, Martyn and Willem, are captured by the forces led by Edmure Tully following the Battle of Stone Mill. They are taken hostage and placed in a cell at Riverrun, the seat of the House Tully. The two boys are murdered by Lord Rickard Karstark as an act of revenge for Jaime Lannister killing his son, Torrhen. [3]
            Dorna's remaining son, Lancel, and her husband, Kevan, are incinerated in the wildfire explosion orchestrated by Cersei Lannister at the Great Sept of Baelor. [4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Dorna is the daughter of Ser Harys Swyft, the Knight of Cornfield and a loyal bannerman of House Lannister. Her father married her to Kevan Lannister and they have three sons: Lancel and the twins Martyn and Willem. They also have a daughter, Janei. Lancel is their eldest child and Janei the youngest.
            According to Kevan, Dorna is a gentle soul, never comfortable except at home with friends and kin around her. She prays seven times a day and loves needlework and flowers.
            Dorna is described "chinless lady, flat-chested and chicken-legged" with her lack of chin shared by her father, yet she is still very loved by her husband.
            It is unclear from Robert's comment about Dorna being a "dumb whore with a fat arse" whether her physical description was changed in the series (as done with many characters) or if he called her that just to insult Lancel (a quite likely explanation given Robert's temperament).
            In his last moments, after being fatally injured by Varys, Kevan's last thought is about Dorna.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dorna_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemDornaLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Doreah</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.9.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Doreah was a handmaiden of Daenerys Targaryen and a former bedslave.
            Doreah was a bedslave in one of the "pleasure houses" of the Free City of Lys.[1] She was later bought by Illyrio Mopatis and moved to his mansion in the city of Pentos.
            Doreah was sold to the pleasure house by her mother when she was nine years old. She didn't touch a man until three years after that, however, and in the intervening years was instructed in the art of seduction. She spent fifteen years there before being bought by Viserys Targaryen, making her approximately twenty-four years old during the first season.[2]
            Doreah is bought as a wedding gift for Daenerys Targaryen by her brother Viserys Targaryen, intending her to serve as a handmaid.[1] Viserys is an exiled Prince from Westeros and has arranged his sister's marriage to the Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo to attempt to reclaim his crown.[3] Doreah tells Daenerys a story of the origin of dragons. She says that there used to be two moons in the sky until the second moon wandered too close to the sun and cracked open, spilling a thousand dragons into the world. Her story is dismissed as nonsense by Dany's other handmaidens, Irri and Jhiqui. Daenerys asks Doreah's advice on how to please Khal Drogo in bed and Doreah tutors her in the sensual arts. She also shows Daenerys how to use her sexuality to establish herself as someone worthy of Drogo's respect.[4]
            Doreah pleasures Viserys and tells him that she has always wanted to see a dragon. She points out she once saw a man who could change his face like clothing, and a pirate covered in gold who flew colorful sails. Viserys is initially amused by the discussion, but sours when it reminds him of the destruction of his house at the hands of the Usurper. He forces Doreah to finish pleasuring him in silence, which she does unenthusiastically.[2]
            Daenerys sends Doreah to invite Viserys for a meal. He takes umbrage with being 'commanded' by a slave and beats Doreah before dragging her through the camp to confront Daenerys.[2] Viserys' temper and inability to control his sister lead him to confront Drogo. Doreah watches as Viserys threatens to kill Daenerys if Drogo does not deliver his promised crown. Drogo feigns acquiescence and then kills Viserys by crowning him with molten gold.[5]
            Doreah is part of Daenerys' retinue as she inspects the markets of Vaes Dothrak. She is present when Jorah Mormont foils a wineseller's attempt to poison Daenerys. The narrow escape convinces Drogo to swear that he will invade Westeros for Daenerys.[6] Doreah remains by Daenerys' side as the Khalasar raids Lhazar to obtain slaves to finance the invasion. Daenerys insists the Dothraki refrain from raping their captives and Doreah watches as Drogo easily defeats a dissenting warrior. After Drogo's death, Doreah and the remaining Dothraki watch as Daenerys walks into the flames of his funeral pyre with her dragon eggs. In the morning they find her with three newly-hatched dragons. Doreah and the khalasar kneel and renew their fealty to Daenerys.[7]
            Doreah continues to serve as Daenerys' handmaiden as the small remains of the khalasar make their way through the Red Waste. She is fascinated with her dragons, and asks her what Viserys knew of them, only to be told that he knew "nothing of dragons". Daenerys' silver horse dies during their journey as a result of thirst and/or hunger. Daenerys halts the majority of the column and sends her bloodriders to scout ahead.[8]
            Kovarro returns having reached the city of Qarth. Daenerys leads her people there but is dismayed when she is refused entry by the ruling elders, the Thirteen. The khalasar are eventually admitted, but only after Daenerys threatens to burn the city to the ground once her dragons are grown. They all enter under the protection of Xaro Xhoan Daxos, after invoking sumai.[9]
            Xaro welcomes Daenerys into his home, giving her people accommodation and buying her gifts. Later, Irri watches as Daenerys and Doreah lean on the stone balcony of their residence. Drogon is perched on the edge of the balcony with a lump of raw meat between them. Daenerys instructs Drogon to breathe flame on the meat by saying Dracarys, the old Valyrian word for Dragon fire. Drogon does as she commands, charring the meat. Doreah and Daenerys watch the dragon gleefully as he feasts on the cooked morsel. Daenerys says that Drogon will be able to feed himself from now on. Doreah reaches for another lump of meat but Daenerys instructs her to let Drogon sleep. Doreah holds out her hand to help the dragon back into his wooden cage and he climbs onto it. Daenerys tells Doreah that the dragon loves her, eliciting a frown from Irri.[10]
            Doreah picks up a dress from the bed and asks if Daenerys has seen it. She tells her Xaro had it made for her and reports hearing that he is the wealthiest man in Qarth. Irri concurs with her fellow handmaiden. Doreah adds that Qarth is the richest city in Essos. Daenerys tells Doreah that they know nothing about their host and suggests that men often speak about other men when they are happy, suggesting that Doreah seduce some of Xaro’s fellow citizens to obtain more information. Doreah says that Daenerys would look like a real princess in Xaro’s dress and Irri objects to the title, correcting Doreah that Daenerys is a khaleesi. Irri breaks the ensuing awkward silence by encouraging Daenerys to wear the dress as a guest’s courtesy to Xaro.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Doreah</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemDoreah</string></dict>
        <key>Melara Hetherspoon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.10.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Melara Hetherspoon was a member of House Hetherspoon, a vassal house of House Lannister, and a childhood friend and companion of Cersei Lannister.
            Melara was a companion of Cersei Lannister at Casterly Rock, a great honor for a noble girl of the Westerlands.
            Melara reluctantly accompanies Cersei in her visit to Maggy, a woods witch and reputed fortunte teller dwelling in a hut deep in a forest close to Casterly Rock. She watches as Cersei pricks her finger to draw a drop of blood for Maggy to taste and read Cersei's future.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Melara Hetherspoon is a daughter of Ser Tybolt Hetherspoon, the head of House Hetherspoon, and a childhood friend of Cersei Lannister. She's described as pretty but freckled, and "healthy as a horse". Unlike her portrayal in the series, Melara is described as bold, whereas the reluctant companion of Cersei and Melara is Jeyne Farman, who flees Maggy's tent the minute the woman opens her eyes.
            Like Cersei, Melara also asks about her future, asking if she will someday marry Jaime Lannister. The question angers Cersei, who thinks that Melara is "a greedy little schemer with ideas above her station", and that Jaime is not even aware that she exists. Maggy answers "Not Jaime, nor any other man. Worms will have your maidenhead. Your death is here tonight, little one. Can you smell her breath? She is very close". Hearing that, Cersei throws a jar of some thick potion into the old woman’s eyes, and the girls flee.
            Melara begs Cersei never to speak of the things they heard that night, promising that if they never talk about it, they’ll soon forget, and then it will be just a bad dream they had.
            Melara dies soon afterwards, by drowning in a well. It is heavily implied that Cersei pushed her into the well, thus fulfulling the prophecy.
            In the fifth novel, while Cersei performs her walk of atonement, she hallucinates that a young girl in the crowd staring at her with Melara’s accusing eyes.
            In the series, the flashback ends before the audience learns if Melara asks her future.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Melara_Hetherspoon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMelaraHetherspoon</string></dict>

Together, they have three children: sons Samwell and Dickon Tarly and daughter Talla Tarly. In contrast to her lord husband, Melessa is a very warm and welcoming person.
            Lady Melessa of House Florent is the wife Lord Randyll Tarly of Horn Hill and mother of Dickon Tarly, Talla Tarly, and Samwell Tarly of the Night's Watch. She is a first cousin of Selyse Florent (the wife of Stannis Baratheon), Lord Axell Florent, and Ser Imry Florent.
            When Jon Snow asks Samwell what he is doing at the Wall, Samwell tells him that his father did not think him manly enough to inherit his title and lands so he forced him to join the Night's Watch or he implied that he would kill him and tell Melessa that it was a hunting accident.[1]
            Before leaving Craster's Keep, Samwell Tarly gives Gilly a thimble that once belonged to Lady Melessa. He explains that he used to read to her while she was sewing but that his father ended the practice when he found out. He reveals that the thimble is the only possession he has from her and that it was a gift given when he left for the Wall.[2]
            Since the Citadel only admits men, Sam decides to send Gilly and her baby Sam to his family at Horn Hill. While he gets on poorly with his father Randyll, he regards his mother and sister as nice.[3]
            Melessa responds just as Sam expected, eagerly greeting him as he arrives. She is also delighted when she sees Little Sam, and coos over her "grandchild". At dinner that evening, Melessa notices that Gilly seems unused to cutlery and seems to be copying her when trying to eat. She later sits uncomfortably as Randyll insults Sam repeatedly, and finally stands up for him, offering the opinion that being the Maester to the Night's Watch is an honor. When Randyll realizes that Gilly is a wildling, Melessa listens to his rant before finally snapping and giving him a piece of her mind, then storming out with Gilly and Talla in tow.[4]
            When Sam takes Gilly and the baby and escapes in the middle of the night, he tells Gilly that his mother will understand.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Melessa Florent is a daughter of Lord Alester Florent, head of House Florent and Lord of Brightwater Keep, and Lady Melara Crane. She's the mother of Samwell and Dickon Tarly. She has not appeared yet in the books.
            Melessa is a first cousin of Selyse Baratheon, as Melessa's father Alester is the older brother of Selyse's father Ryam.

After Stannis Baratheon's death at the Battle of Winterfell, she revives Jon Snow after he is murdered by various members of the Night's Watch, believing him to be The Prince That Was Promised, and serves Jon as an adviser until she is banished from the North after the Battle of the Bastards when Jon learns that she sacrificed Shireen Baratheon and countless innocent people while in Stannis's service. However, she later unites the newly crowned King in the North with Daenerys Targaryen, believing they both have an important part to play in the Great War.
            Originally born a slave in Essos centuries ago, Melisandre is a Red Priestess of the Lord of Light, a deity that is not widely worshiped in Westeros. Hailing from Asshai, a country located in the far east of the continent of Essos, she claims to wield powerful magical abilities, particularly the power of prophecy. Melisandre wears a large ruby necklace that seems to glow whenever she performs her magic. Some years ago she crossed the Narrow Sea and came to the court of Lord Stannis Baratheon on the island stronghold of Dragonstone, to preach her faith. Stannis and the majority of his household have now converted to her religion, and she has become a close adviser to Stannis himself.[1]
            On a beach in the island of Dragonstone, Melisandre conducts a ceremony for her god, the Lord of Light. Behind her, statues of the Seven, widely worshiped in Westeros, are burning as offerings. She intones "The Night is Dark and Full of Terrors" and the crowd of onlookers repeat her words. Melisandre predicts that a heavy darkness will fall on the world in the wake of the long summer, that stars will bleed while the cold breath of winter will freeze the seas and says that the dead will rise in the north. Maester Cressen steps in front of her and interrupts the ceremony, reminding the crowd that they were "named in the light of the Seven". Melisandre dismisses Cressen as old and fearful and challenges him to stop her. Cressen hangs his head and walks away. She continues her preaching with the story of the burning sword Lightbringer. She calls Stannis forward and he withdraws a flaming sword from the statue of the Mother with a gloved hand. His men cheer him as he holds the sword aloft and then kneel as he thrusts the sword into the sand. They chant "Lord cast your light upon us." Davos is the last to kneel as Melisandre responds "The Night is Dark and Full of Terrors." Stannis answers "The Night is Dark and Full of Terror." He holds out his hand to his wife Selyse Baratheon who joins him and they lead the congregation from the beach.[2]
            Inside the castle of Dragonstone, Stannis holds a meeting in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Matthos Seaworth reads aloud from a letter that he has prepared stating Stannis's claim to the Iron Throne. Stannis objects to the use of "beloved brother" to refer to Robert Baratheon, Davos calls it a harmless courtesy but Stannis insists that it is a lie and that it be removed from the letter. Matthos continues to detail the illegitimacy of Joffrey Baratheon and Cersei's other children as products of incest between Cersei Lannister and Jaime Lannister. Stannis insists that Jaime be called the Kingslayer but also that Jaime's title as a knight be acknowledged. He orders copies of the letter to be sent to every corner of the realm from the Arbor to the Wall.[2]
            Davos counsels that House Lannister is the true enemy and urges Stannis to make peace with his younger brother Renly Baratheon. Stannis says that he will not make peace with Renly while he is claiming the throne. Davos notes that many lords have already declared for Renly including Mace Tyrell and Randyll Tarly.
            Melisandre interjects that Stannis does not need to beg lords for support because the Lord of Light stands behind him. Davos asks how many ships the Lord of Light can command and Melisandre says that He has no need for ships. Davos accepts that He does not but says that they do if they are going to war. Davos asks Stannis to consider Robb Stark instead of Renly. Stannis counters that Robb is trying to steal the northern half of his kingdom and reminds Davos that he had always been firm with thieves. He says that Joffrey, Renly and Robb are all thieves and that they must bend the knee to him or be destroyed. Cressen stands and offers an apology for his actions on the beach before inviting Melisandre to share his wine. He draws from the cup before handing it to Melisandre. Cressen steadies himself on the table and his nose begins to bleed: he had poisoned the drink. Melisandre drinks from the cup anyway and then watches the Maester collapse, his blood spreading on the stone floor beneath him. She says that the fire burns the terrors of the night away and the jewel in her choker pulsates with light.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Melisandre</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMelisandre</string></dict>

            Myriah Martell was a Dornish Princess of House Martell of Sunspear. She married King Daeron II Targaryen and became the mother of four sons - Baelor, Aerys, Rhaegel, and Maekar - and one daughter, Aelinor.
            Queen Myriah, along with her progenie, is mentioned in House Targaryen's entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Queen Myriah married Daeron II as part of the marriage pact that brought Dorne under the rule of the Iron Throne. Though originally named Myriah in the novels, her name has been retconned as Mariah Martell in The World of Ice and Fire.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Myriah_Martell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMyriahMartell</string></dict>
        <key>Myranda</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.14.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Myranda was Ramsay Bolton's lover, and much like him had a cruel and sadistic nature, taking pleasure in inflicting pain and killing.
            Myranda was a servant of House Bolton of the Dreadfort, her father being the castle's kennelmaster. She was one of Ramsay Snow's bedwarmers, and part-time helper in some of his torture sessions.
            Myranda and Violet enter the torture cellar in which Theon Greyjoy is kept hostage, release the former Prince of Winterfell and put him on a bed. Then they attempt to seduce him, claiming they have heard the heir to Pyke is "well endowed". Violet claims Myranda was in training to become a septa but her sexual urges kept her from taking the vows. Theon is initially distrustful but cannot help but grow aroused when Myranda, stripped of her clothes by Violet, straddles him.
            Suddenly, they are interrupted by a horn sounded by Ramsay Snow. He taunts Theon and tells him that he has also heard about Theon's manhood, before pulling out a gelding knife. Myranda and Violet then watch with amusement as Theon begs for mercy while being held to the floor by two men and castrated by Ramsay. Afterwards, as Theon is still tied to the cross, Ramsay taunts him about being a eunuch.[1]
            Some time later, Myranda joins Ramsay in hunting another bedwarmer, Tansy, of whom she is jealous, through a forest near the Dreadfort. She enjoys seeing the terrified girl being chased by her master's hounds for a while, but eventually shoots her through the leg with an arrow, and moments later watches her being mauled to death by the dogs.[2]
            Myranda later engages in sex with Ramsay as Yara Greyjoy and a group of ironborn climb over the walls of the Dreadfort to rescue Theon to no avail as he refuses.[3]
            Myranda accompanies the rest of House Bolton to their new home, Winterfell. She is present when the Boltons and their household gather at the castle's main yard to greet the newly arrived Sansa Stark and Petyr Baelish. She watches with obvious jealousy and anger as Ramsay greets his new betrothed, Sansa.[4]
            While in Ramsay's bedroom, Myranda discusses Ramsay’s upcoming marriage to Sansa, admitting her jealousy of her, especially since Ramsay had promised to marry Myranda back when he was a bastard.
            Ramsay disregards Myranda's insecurities, causing Myranda to proclaim that perhaps she will marry too and leave him. This angers Ramsay who violently tells her that she is his and she is not going anywhere, unless she continues to bore him with her petty jealousy. He threateningly reminds her what he does to people who bore him, and hearing this Myranda swears never to bore him again. He forces himself on her and she bites his lip before they have sex.
            Later, as Sansa wanders around the castle, Myranda approaches her beside the tower where Jaime Lannister once pushed Bran Stark from the window. Myranda puts on a friendly façade, talking to Sansa about her mother’s demise and offering her condolences, which Sansa accepts, though she clearly sees through her. To help Sansa "remember" how things used to be before her family's untimely death, Myranda leads Sansa down to the kennels to reunite her with Theon.[5]
            The night of the wedding, Myranda is sent by Ramsay to draw Sansa's bath, an order neither woman is enthusiastic about. As she wrings the black dye out of Sansa's hair, Myranda advises her not to let Ramsay get bored of her, and tells her the fates of Violet, Tansy, and a third unseen girl named Kyra.
            Sansa boldly asks if Myranda ever really believed that Ramsay would marry her, which stops the girl dead in her tracks. Sansa coolly declares that she is a Stark and Winterfell is her home: she refuses to be scared and nothing Myranda says will intimidate her. Silently fuming but unable to retaliate, Myranda asks if she is still needed. Sansa dismisses her. She is later present at Ramsay and Sansa's wedding, again looking on with jealousy as they are married.[6]
            During the battle between the Bolton soldiers and the forces of Stannis Baratheon, Myranda takes Theon and corners Sansa with a bow and arrow before she can escape under the orders of Ramsay to bring her to her bed chamber. After Sansa makes it clear that she is unafraid of death, Myranda admits that Ramsay needs Sansa alive in order to birth an heir to the North, though she still threatens to maim her with her arrow. Before she can release it, Theon grabs her, making her fire and miss. In the ensuing struggle, Theon ignores Myranda's pleas and throws her off the rampart to her death, enacting a small justice for his castration as well as the death of Tansy.[7]
            Myranda's body is found and Ramsay pays his respects to her corpse. He remembers how they met when she was only eleven and that from the very start she never showed fear towards him. He appears somewhat saddened over her death and ends his eulogy with a promise of revenge to the people who killed her but then proceeds to casually tell Maester Wolkan to feed her body to the dogs, so as not to waste her flesh.[8] Despite his promise to avenge her, Ramsay is ultimately defeated in combat by Jon Snow and also fed to the dogs.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Myranda</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMyranda</string></dict>
        <key>Mirri Maz Duur</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.15.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mirri Maz Duur was a Lhazareen godswife enslaved by the khalasar led by Drogo. She treated Drogo for a small wound he took during the sack of her village. He became gravely unwell and she convinced his wife Daenerys Targaryen to let her use blood magic, promising to save his life. She left Drogo in a vegetative state and took the blood price of Daenerys' unborn child in vengeance for the attack on her people. She was burned to death on Drogo's funeral pyre by Daenerys.
            Mirri Maz Duur is a godswife - a healer and wise woman - living amongst the Lhazareen, worshippers of the Great Shepherd. She's also a maegi, a practitioner of blood magic.
            Duur's village is raided by the Dothraki khalasar under Khal Drogo. The captive women are taken into slavery and raped. The Khaleesi Daenerys Targaryen orders that the Lhazareen women - including Mirri Maz Duur - be handed over to her custody to protect them. One of Drogo's warriors, Mago, objects. When Drogo agrees to Daenerys' request, Mago challenges Drogo to single combat. Drogo kills Mago, but takes a minor arakh wound to his chest. Mirri Maz Duur volunteers to heal the wound, saying that she is a godswife, or priestess of the Lhazareen god, the Great Shepherd. Drogo's bloodrider Qotho objects, calling Duur a maegi - a witch - but Drogo accepts her offering at Dany's urging.[1]
            In spite of - or maybe because of - Mirri Maz Duur's attentions, Drogo's wound becomes infected, making him seriously ill, and he falls from his horse, a sign of weakness among the Dothraki that threatens his position of khal. Duur claims that she can save him, but requires a blood sacrifice. She suggests killing Drogo's horse. Qotho becomes enraged at her use of magic to save Drogo and tries to stop the ceremony, but is killed by Ser Jorah Mormont. Daenerys is thrown to the ground during the fight and goes into labor, so Mormont takes her into the tent where Duur is carrying out the ceremony – in spite of Duur's strict warning not to interrupt – to ask for her aid.[2]
            When Daenerys awakens she learns that her son was stillborn and malformed. She finds Drogo alive but in a vegetative state. Daenerys asks desperately when will Drogo be as he was, and Duur answers: "When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east, when the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves". Duur explains that Daenerys got what she traded for, and that before she was "saved" by Daenerys, she had already been raped several times and her temple had been burned. Now thanks to her spell, neither Drogo nor his son will cause any more suffering. Daenerys builds a funeral pyre for Drogo and orders Jorah to bind Duur to the pyre. The maegi claims she won't scream. She begins chanting as the flames slowly engulf her, though her singing quickly changes to shrieks of pain as she is burnt alive. True to Daenerys's word, Duur dies screaming.[3]
            Mirri is briefly referred to by Daenerys when she explains to Jon Snow that she cannot have any children. Jon points out that the witch who killed her husband and cursed her is not a particularly reliable source of information as to her current health.[4]
            Mirri Maz Duur's role in the series is largely unchanged from the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, with the books giving more details about her history. She is the godswife of a Lhazareen village and is rumored to have unearthly powers. Her mother had been a godswife before her and taught her all the spells and songs. As a young girl, Mirri had traveled to Asshai to learn the arts of the shadowbinders. She also studied the lore of the moonsingers of the Jogos Nhai, the herb lore of the Dothraki, and medicines and anatomy with the then-travelling Archmaester Marwyn.
            Duur's treachery makes Daenerys reluctant to trust Quaithe, who, among other things, seems to imply that Daenerys should visit Asshai next. When Daenerys was at the House of the Undying, one of the prophecies she heard was "Three treasons will you know, once for blood and once for gold and once for love". Daenerys believes that Mirri Maz Duur committed the blood treason.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mirri_Maz_Duur</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMirriMazDuur</string></dict>
        <key>Mira Forrester</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.16.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mira Forrester is the eldest daughter of Lord Gregor Forrester and his wife, Elissa Forrester. Known to put family first, Mira was sent to Highgarden to serve as Handmaiden to Lady Margaery Tyrell, which would later result in her being taken to the capital, King's Landing.
            
            Mira had always been fond of Ironrath, but Lady Forrester — wanting her eldest daughter to learn the ways of a southern court — arranged for Mira to serve as a handmaiden to Margaery Tyrell. To Mira’s great surprise, she enjoyed attending on Margaery at Highgarden, and followed her to King’s Landing with enthusiasm. Life in the capital has not been easy for Mira, as her straightforward Northern ways are often at odds with the subtleties of court life – but she also has more guile than she realizes.[1]
            Mira is at King's Landing as handmaiden to Margaery, as she was sent south by her mother, who wanted her to learn the ways of the south. Mira receives a letter from her mother asking her to appeal to Lady Margaery to try and ask her to intervene on the house's behalf. Later she talks with Margaery, and Margaery tells her Queen Cersei demands an apology from Mira, and wishes to have an audience with her.
            Fellow handmaiden Sera Durwell goes to the throne room while Margaery and Mira wait outside, talking about the upcoming talk. Sera comes and gets them and they are allowed in. In the court she must prove to Queen Cersei that the allegiance of House Forrester lies with the Crown. Cersei also questions whether she is loyal to King Joffrey or Margaery. Cersei also asks if House Forrester is willing to supply ironwood to the Crown. She also has a little conversation with Tyrion Lannister. She is also offered help by a coal boy. Mira receives news that Ramsay Snow is riding for Ironrath and fears for the safety of her family. She may ask Margaery to request Joffrey to give House Forrester the protection of the crown so no harm can come to her family. However Joffrey refuses to do so and the safety of her House is in jeopardy.
            In Mira's first appearance in the episode, she is writing invitations for Lady Margaery's wedding to King Joffrey. A letter is delivered to her from her mother by Tom the coal boy, asking for help in ensuring Lady Elaena Glenmore's betrothal to Rodrik remain intact. Her mother wishes for Lady Margaery to help by sending a letter to the Glenmores encouraging the marriage. However, Margaery refuses, stating she doesn't want to force Elaena's hand, and says she is sure her brother can secure the marriage on his own. Mira is given the choice whether to finish an invitation to Ser Maynard or forge a letter to Elaena Glenmore. Handmaiden Sera enters the room, and asks to talk to Mira.
            Mira and Sera walk in the gardens around King's Landing, and Sera leads Mira to a seating area, where she reveals she has a cask of wine from Cersei's favorite stock. Mira has the choice whether to drink some of the wine or not. Sera reveals she is in fact a bastard, and her full name is Sera Flowers. During their talk they get interrupted by Tyrion Lannister, who questions them about the source of the wine. He reveals his father has become interested in ironwood, and that he is meeting representatives, two merchant lords, Andros and Morgryn of Lord Whitehill, and invites Mira along. After the shock of learning Tyrion invited Mira, Tyrion dismisses the representatives and discusses the ironwood business with Mira. Mira returns to her room later to find someone has been in and looked through her stuff, and left a note, asking to meet in the gardens at midnight.
            Mira goes to the gardens at midnight to see who left the note. She gets stopped by a Lannister guardsman, the same one that stood at the door for the discussion of the ironwood earlier in the episode, but then Ser Damien steps in for Mira. He talks to her, but then he tries to assassinate her. She manages to struggle for a while, but Tom knocks him off her. However, Damien begins to drown him in the fountain, and Mira has the choice to attack and kill Damien, or run away. Tom offers to get rid of the body for Mira if she killed him, and she also has a choice to keep or toss the knife.
            Margaery's wedding to Joffrey is only days away, and in arriving to help prepare, Mira listens distractedly as Sera voices her excitement at the prospect of potentially finding a husband. As Sera asks Mira to cover for her as she leaves to introduce herself to Lord Tarwick, Mira notices the coal boy hiding in the bushes. If Mira hadn't helped the coal boy from the drowning, Mira will be surprised to see him alive. The coal boy will be angry with her for not helping him. If Mira had killed Damien in order to save the coal boy, their conversation will go more smoothly. Regardless, the coal boy (whose name will be mentioned as Tom, dependent on dialogue choices) will update Mira on news regarding the murder, that the body has been hid, but Damien's blood has been discovered at the scene, although they couldn't know for sure it is Damien's. Fearful, Mira will remind him of the guard that had seen her that night or of the knife. Tom will promise Mira that he'll watch her back. Sera will then announce her presence, catching them together. Sera will assume they have a romantic relationship, and the player can choose to play along to ward off suspicion.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mira_Forrester</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMiraForrester</string></dict>

        <key>Myrcella Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.18.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Princess Myrcella Baratheon was commonly thought to be the only daughter of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. However, like her brothers, her real father is Jaime Lannister.
            After her upbringing in King's Landing, Myrcella was shipped to Dorne in an attempt to forge a marriage-alliance with House Martell by having her wed to Trystane Martell. However, Myrcella was later killed by Ellaria Sand, who took vengeance for the Lannister family's involvement in Oberyn Martell's death.
            Princess Myrcella was commonly thought to be the only daughter of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. Cersei and Robert married to seal a political alliance between House Baratheon and House Lannister after Robert took the throne by force from the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen.[1] Myrcella had an older brother, Joffrey, and a younger, Tommen, with whom she was close. The real father of all three children is Jaime Lannister, her uncle (Cersei's twin brother) and a member of the Kingsguard, making them bastards born of incest. However, like her siblings and the rest of Westeros, Myrcella had no idea of the truth of her parentage at the time. She had a sweet and quiet disposition and was fond of her uncle Tyrion Lannister.[2]
            Myrcella accompanies her family north to Winterfell after the death of Jon Arryn. During their stay, Bran Stark is severely injured.[3] Myrcella is eating breakfast with Cersei, Jaime and Tommen when her uncle Tyrion joins them. Myrcella asks whether Bran will die and Tyrion replies that he is expected to live, delighting Myrcella and horrifying Cersei. Tyrion excites Myrcella and Tommen by announcing that he wishes to see the Wall and the “wintry abode of the White Walkers.” He then amuses them by claiming that he wants to urinate off the edge of the wall. Cersei is irritated by his rudeness and leaves, taking the children with her.[4]
            Myrcella attends the tournament to celebrate Eddard Stark becoming Hand of the King. She witnesses the horrific death of Ser Hugh of the Vale during his joust against Ser Gregor Clegane.[5] Myrcella returns for the second day of the tournament and applauds when Ser Loras Tyrell unseats Gregor. Gregor attacks Loras and Sandor Clegane intervenes. King Robert calls an end to the fighting. Myrcella joins the applause when Loras declares Sandor a champion.[6]
            Myrcella attends a tense dinner with her younger brother Tommen, her mother Cersei, and Sansa Stark. Myrcella naively makes smalltalk with Sansa, asking when she will marry Joffrey, and Cersei explains it will be after the war ends. Myrcella says that she is excited for the new gowns she will wear to the wedding. She good-naturedly points out that Sansa will be wearing an ivory gown as the bride. Sansa isn't sure how to react but Cersei presses her to respond. Sansa parrots the usual lines that she looks forward to being married to Joffrey.[8]
            In order to strengthen House Lannister's political position during the War of the Five Kings, Hand of the King Tyrion Lannister makes plans to forge a marriage-alliance with House Martell of Dorne by having Princess Myrcella wed to Trystane Martell, the youngest child of the current ruler of Dorne. In return House Martell would hopefully supply soldiers to the Lannisters' side, or at least ensure they wouldn't openly side with their enemies.
            The actual marriage ceremony will wait until Myrcella is old enough, but part of the arrangement involves sending her to Dorne to live in the Martell household. Queen Cersei is furious with Tyrion when she hears (from Grand Maester Pycelle) what he is planning, declaring that she won't let her only daughter be shipped off to Dorne as she was shipped off to Robert Baratheon. Tyrion counters that as a princess, many would say that Myrcella was born to one day forge a marriage alliance, and she will be safer in Dorne than in the capital city during a major civil war. Against Cersei's continued protests, Tyrion insists that the plan has already been finalized, leaving Cersei fuming and in tears for her daughter.[8]
            Myrcella later plays with her handmaidens in a castle garden before the eyes of Septa Eglantine, while her inebriated mother bitterly criticizes Tyrion for being ready to "seal my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away". Tyrion insists that she will be safer in Dorne, and Cersei mocks his concern for her. Tyrion firmly says that he is indeed concerned for Myrcella's safety: she is a sweet, innocent girl, and "I don't blame her at all for you".[9] Myrcella tearfully departs King's Landing on a ship bound for Sunspear accompanied by Septa Eglantine and Ser Arys Oakheart of the Kingsguard. She is seen off at the docks by a formal royal procession including King Joffrey, Prince Tommen, Queen Cersei, Acting Hand of the King Tyrion Lannister, and Sansa Stark with prayers for her and her safe journey delivered by the High Septon.[10]
            After Jaime returns to King's Landing, Cersei lists off to him all she has suffered since he left for the war over two years ago, one of which is that their daughter Myrcella has been shipped off to Dorne to secure a political marriage-alliance.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Myrcella_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMyrcellaBaratheon</string></dict>
        <key>Walda Bolton</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.19.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Walda Bolton, née Frey, better known as Fat Walda, was the new wife of Roose Bolton, the Lord of the Dreadfort.
            Walda is a member of House Frey and a granddaughter of Lord Walder Frey.
            During the wedding feast of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey, Lord Bolton recounts to Catelyn Stark and Ser Brynden "Blackfish" Tully how Lord Walder Frey proposed that he marry one of his granddaughters and offered her weight in silver as a dowry. Lord Bolton then adds he chose the fattest bride available. Catelyn tactfully responds that she hoped that this has made him happy, to which he replies, "She's made me very rich."[1]
            Walda travels north with her new husband to the Boltons' ancestral castle: The Dreadfort. She is clearly intimidated by her new surroundings and greets her stepson Ramsay with a meek "hello", even though Ramsay greets her politely, calls her "mother" and kisses her on the cheek.[2]
            Walda travels to Winterfell with Roose, Ramsay, and others from the Bolton household. She is there to greet Ramsay's betrothed, Sansa Stark.[3]
            At a "family" dinner, Ramsay remains polite toward Walda, filling her cup with wine, to which Walda thanks him with suspicion. Walda tries to sympathize with Sansa, saying it must be difficult being in a strange place, which is something that Walda is experiencing herself. Sansa reminds her that Winterfell is her home, and states that it is the people who are strange. This prompts Ramsay to bring Reek into the room to serve more wine for everybody, including Walda, who is visibly repulsed by him.
            When Roose senses that Ramsay is getting too smug for his own good, he prompts Walda to announce that she is pregnant. Roose adds that from the way she is carrying Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy, which clearly distresses Ramsay but delights Sansa.
            Ramsay later confronts Roose about the news, expressing his concern of his inheritance to The North, in the event that the child is a boy. Ramsay also takes several jabs at Walda's weight, and ponders how Roose was able to consummate his marriage. However, Roose assures that Ramsay is and will remain his son and heir, and is to succeed him – although he maintains his implied threat that Ramsay had better behave himself if that is to remain the plan.[4]
            Walda is later present at Ramsay and Sansa's wedding ceremony in the Winterfell godswood.[5]
            Walda eventually gives birth to a baby boy and shortly thereafter, is summoned along with the baby to Winterfell's courtyard by Ramsay who leads her into the kennels. Quickly realizing that Roose is dead and what is about to happen, she begs Ramsay to let her go, saying that she will go back to the Riverlands and never set foot in Winterfell again. She also reminds Ramsay that her son is his half-brother. Her pleas fall on deaf ears, however, and Ramsay unleashes his hounds who proceed to kill both her and her newborn son. [6]
            Walda and her son are later avenged along with many others when Ramsay is devoured by his own hounds after his defeat in the Battle of the Bastards.[7]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Fat Walda is the second of three daughters of Merrett Frey and Mariya Darry. Merrett is himself the ninth son of Lord Walder. She is known for her gluttony, hence her nickname, which her father considers shameful, though less shameful than her older sister Amerei, known as "Gatehouse Ami" for her blatant promiscuity.
            Lord Walder taunted Merrett that Walda is "a sow in silk", her weight being the only reason Roose married her. He remarks that the Freys would have had the same alliance at half the price if "the little porkling" put down her spoon from time to time.
            She is described as a round pink butterball of a girl, with watery eyes, a huge bosom and limp yellow hair. Her voice is thin and squeaky. She is fifteen years old when she marries Roose. Walda has a giggling, fun-loving, even charming personality, and is known for cracking bawdy jokes. It is loosely implied, however, that this is simply an outward persona that she affects to fool others into thinking she is harmless, when she is secretly very intelligent - some of her bawdy jokes can actually be quite witty.
            When Roose stays in Harrenhal, Walda writes him letters almost every day, and all the letters are the same: "I pray for you morn, noon, and night, my sweet lord, and count the days until you share my bed again. Return to me soon, and I will give you many trueborn sons to take the place of your dear Domeric and rule the Dreadfort after you." Arya Stark is present when Roose receives one such letter, but he may have never responded to any of them. Roose tells Arya to burn Walda's love letters, though this is not particularly significant, as Roose burns all of his personal correspondence to prevent his enemies or rivals from reading it.
            Fat Walda attends the Red Wedding and sits next to Catelyn Stark. It is Fat Walda who tells Ser Wendel Manderly, while Catelyn overhears, about her grandfather's dowry offer to Lord Bolton. She is one of the many Frey girls that King Robb Stark politely dances with during the festivities.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Walda_Bolton</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemWaldaBolton</string></dict>
        <key>Sharra Arryn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.20.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sharra Arryn was the widow of a King of Mountain and Vale and the Queen Regent of Kingdom of Mountain and Vale, ruling in the name of her son Ronnel Arryn, at the time of the War of Conquest.
            Queen Sharra was alongside her son when Visenya Targaryen flew to the Eyrie demanding submission. Ronnel bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror and surrendered the Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale in exchange for a ride atop Vhagar.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, it is unknown to which house Sharra Arryn was born. She was regarded as the most beautiful woman in Westeros.
            When Aegon made his intentions known to the Kings of Westeros, Queen Sharra, who was ten years older than Aegon, sent him a portrait of her and a marriage proposal with the condition he made her son his heir. Aegon refused (quipping that he already had two wives and needed no more), prompting the Vale to resist the invasion. At the Battle of Gulltown, Visenya Targaryen was defeated, but she managed to burn the Arryn fleet. Rather than join the alliance of the Kingdom of the Reach and the Kingdom of the Rock, Sharra adopted a siege strategy, closing the Bloody Gate and positioning her land armies to massacre the Targaryen army if it tried to force the mountain pass. The result was that the strength of the Vale was not present at the Field of Fire.
            Nevertheless, by the time Sharra returned to the Eyrie she found Visenya already there, with King Ronnel sitting on her lap, asking his mother if he could take a ride on Vhagar – who was perched on a nearby battlement. The implicit threat of her son being held by Visenya was enough to make Sharra surrender. After exchanging pleasantries, she promptly and politely brought the crowns of the Vale to Visenya, who then took Ronnel for his ride.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sharra_Arryn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemSharraArryn</string></dict>

            Lady Shella Whent is an old woman. She's a loyal vassal of Hoster Tully, the Lord of Riverrun. Her husband's younger brother was , Ser Oswell Whent, a member of King Aerys II Targaryen's Kingsguard.[1]
            To take Tyrion Lannister prisoner at the Inn at the Crossroads, Catelyn Stark asserts her origin as a daughter of House Tully and then tells a man of House Whent, Ser Willis Wode, that she recognizes the black bat of Harrenhal on his coat. He affirms Lady Whent's loyalty to Lord Hoster Tully or Riverrun when asked and then helps her to arrest Tyrion.[2]
            During the War of the Five Kings, Harrenhal is occupied by the forces of House Lannister.[3] Lady Whent surrendered Harrenhal to Tywin Lannister after the Battle at the Mummer's Ford.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Shella Whent was the Lady of Harrenhal until she surrendered the castle to forces belonging to House Lannister during the War of the Five Kings because she lacked the means to defend it. She is considered a friend of the Night's Watch. In the fourth novel, Petyr Baelish states that she has died (without specifying the manner of her death), but it is not confirmed.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Shella_Whent</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemShellaWhent</string></dict>
        <key>Shae</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.22.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shae was a prostitute who had begun an exclusive relationship with Tyrion Lannister during the time when he was fighting in the Lannister army as part of the Vanguard during the Battle of the Green Fork. When he is sent to King's Landing to be acting Hand of the King, he takes Shae with him as his mistress in defiance of his father's orders, and she lives with him at the Tower of the Hand. The only person who knows she is there is Varys the Master of Whisperers, who while not completely trusted, was an advisor to Tyrion and did keep their secret.
            When Shae is bored, Tyrion arranged for her to work as a Handmaiden to Sansa Stark, where she acts as confidant through the difficulties of Joffrey's abuse and the siege of Stannis Baratheon. Queen Cersei is threatening Tyrion and his fear for Shae's safety makes him realize how much he has come to love her. After the Battle of the Blackwater with Tyrion injured and no longer Hand of the King, she urges him to flee with her to Pentos. When he tells her his place is here, she agrees to stay with him. However, their relationship comes under strain when Tyrion is forcibly married to Sansa, inciting Shae's jealousy despite Sansa and Tyrion never consummating their marriage.
            Fearing for her safety, Tyrion eventually sends her away, insulting her in the process. However, she is intercepted before leaving the capital and gives vengeful (but false) testimony against Tyrion, whom she considers has betrayed her to remain with Sansa, at his trial for the assassination of King Joffrey, in the process having an affair with Tyrion's father, Tywin. She attempts to kill him, forcing him to kill her in self-defense, breaking him completely.
            Shae is a young woman of mystery, as she won't divulge her true origins. She has a Lorathi accent and is obviously not native to Westeros: she says she arrived there ten years ago. She is first encountered as a camp-follower with the Lannister army in the Riverlands. She has dreams of wealth and power, despite her low social status as a kept woman.[1] She hails from the Free City of Lorath.[2]
            At unspecified points in the past, Shae has been to Dorne and Volantis.[3]
            Shae is a camp-follower whom Bronn, a sellsword in the service of Tyrion Lannister, finds as per Tyrion's request. She is attached to a ginger-haired Knight, but Bronn "persuades" him to give her up to Tyrion Lannister, who is fighting with the army of Lannister in the Riverlands. He is charmed by her immediately. He tells her he wants the truth, but also that he wants her to act as if she wants him and that it's their last night on earth together. Tyrion plays a drinking game with her and Bronn in an attempt to learn more about Shae's past, but she refuses to reveal specifics. Tyrion tells her that he thinks her mother was a whore and her father deserted them, she says emphatically that he is wrong, and she doesn't want to speak of them. He seems more on the mark when he talks of her ambitions until he gets to the part of saying she was low born, she indicates he is wrong, thus she was not low-born. Shae deflects Tyrion's questions and learns about his past instead, particularly the incident involving his marriage to Tysha. When Tyrion was 16, he fell in love and secretly married a young wheelwright's daughter whom he helped protect from two rapers, but the girl turned out to be a prostitute hired by Jaime Lannister to make a man of him. When Tywin Lannister found out he had the marriage annulled and had the girl gang-raped by his guards. Shae's response is that he should have known she was a whore, as a girl doesn't invite another man into her bed after almost being raped.[4]
            Following a victory in the Battle of the Green Fork, Tyrion is made acting Hand of the King by his father Tywin Lannister. Tywin had been named as Hand to his grandson, Joffrey Baratheon, but due to the war he must remain with his army in the field. Tywin forbade Tyrion taking Shae to court. Tyrion complains about his father to Shae, then decides to defy his order, much to her delight.[5]
            Shae accompanies Tyrion to King's Landing and he installs her secretly in the Tower of the Hand.[6] Varys discovers Shae's presence and subtly threatens Tyrion with the information. Shae tells Varys that Tyrion met her when she was employed in his father's kitchens.[7] Shae becomes increasingly fed up at her confinement and Tyrion arranges for her to serve as a handmaiden to the captive Sansa Stark.[8] Sansa comes to trust Shae and confides her hatred of King Joffrey after she is injured in the Riot of King's Landing. Shae warns her to trust no-one.[9]
            Shae discovers Sansa trying to conceal evidence of her first period because it means she is ready to bear Joffrey's children. Shae helps her, even threatens a maid into silence when she walks in on them, but they are discovered by Sandor Clegane. Sansa is taken before Queen Cersei.[10]
            Shae is bemused when Tyrion rushes in especially tender and protective with her and wanting to exchange words of love, "I am yours, and you are mine"; unbeknownst to her Queen Cersei has imprisoned and threatened the prostitute Ros mistakenly believing that she is Tyrion's current lover. Tyrion is overjoyed that Shae is safe, as she has come to be important to him.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Shae</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemShae</string></dict>
        <key>Jhiqui</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.23.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jhiqui is a young Dothraki woman who is given to Daenerys Targaryen as a handmaiden, along with Irri and Doreah.
            Jhiqui is a Dothraki woman in Drogo's khalasar.
            Jhiqui, Irri, and Doreah tend to Daenerys in her tent. Jhiqui doesn't say much, and comes across as silent and obedient. However, she does side with Irri in saying that the moon is a goddess, and not a giant dragon egg as Doreah claims.[1]
            Jhiqui has only appeared in a single episode. It is not clear if she remained loyal to Daenerys following the death of Drogo, though if she did it is unlikely she survived long as Daenerys's entire remaining khalasar is shown on camera in "Garden of Bones" and she is not present. Nevertheless, a Dothraki handmaiden is shown in "The Bear and the Maiden Fair", though it is unknown if she is meant to represent Jhiqui.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jhiqui is a member of a khalasar defeated in battle by Khal Drogo's. She was enslaved and later given to Daenerys to teach her the Dothraki language.
            In the fifth novel, Jhiqui and Irri both develop a crush on Rakharo, who has grown more tall and muscular. Both argue whom he would prefer.
            Following Daenerys's departure from Meereen, Jhiqui and Irri accompany the Dothraki search parties, dispatched across the Skahazadhan to locate their queen.
            In the books, Jhiqui is frequently seen with Irri, both in service to Daenerys. In the TV series, however, she appears only briefly in one scene. Thus, it is unclear of the TV version of Jhiqui remains in Daenerys' khalassar or was among those who abandoned her after Drogo's death. The TV series condensed most of her role with that of Irri.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jhiqui</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemJhiqui</string></dict>
        <key>Chella</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.24.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Chella is the leader of the Black Ears clan and fought for House Lannister in the War of the Five Kings.
            Chella, daughter of Cheyk, is the leader of the Black Ears, one of the hill tribes living in the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon on the western edge of the Vale of Arryn. She is not of remarkable stature, but wears a necklace of ears around her neck, with each ear coming from a slain foe. Her success in battle has seen her rise high amongst the hill tribes.
            Chella accompanies Shagga, Timett, Tyrion Lannister and Bronn to the Lannister army encampment when Tyrion promises the hill tribes weapons and autonomy from the Eyrie. Tywin Lannister agrees to honor the bargain Tyrion has made with them.[1] The Black Ears take part in the Battle of the Green Fork, helping the Lannister forces win the engagement, and several are seen cutting ears off the fallen foes on the battlefield.[2]
            Chella and her men escort Tyrion to King's Landing, where he takes his place as Acting Hand of the King on behalf of Tywin.[3]
            Following the Battle of the Blackwater, all members of the Hill tribes receive payment from Lord Tywin Lannister and are sent away from King's Landing.[4]
            * - Uncredited appearances
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Black Ears are noted for their habit of collecting the ears of fallen foes. Chella has forty-six ears on her necklace, and boasts that her sons have nearly fifty between them. She hasn't necessarily killed all of their owners; it is common practice for her tribe to cut the ears off of defeated prisoners as trophies, but they often let them leave with their lives.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Chella</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemChella</string></dict>
        <key>Shireen Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.25.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Princess Shireen Baratheon was the daughter and only living child of Stannis and Selyse Baratheon.
            Shireen is the daughter of Stannis and Selyse Baratheon. Her father is the head of House Baratheon of Dragonstone and has declared himself King on the Iron Throne. Shireen is Stannis's only living child and therefore his heir presumptive. She is the same age as Arya Stark. She had three older brothers, who were stillborn.
            The left side of her face is scarred by Greyscale, which she caught as an infant. Normally considered a death sentence, Stannis refused to give up on her and called in every healer he could find from both sides of the Narrow Sea to try to cure her, and through the combination of their efforts they managed to succeed, though the left side of her face was left permanently scarred.
            Selyse resents Shireen because she could not give Stannis a healthy son, only a sickly daughter, and dismisses her as stubborn and sinful. Shireen in turn tries to avoid her mother, because she is frightened by Selyse's fanatical devotion to Melisandre and the Lord of Light. However, Shireen adores her father and he loves her deeply as well, though he is a dour man who doesn't often let it show through his stern exterior. She is also close friends with Stannis's most trusted advisor, Ser Davos Seaworth, who loves her like his own daughter.
            Having ignored Selyse and Shireen for several months, Stannis pays them a visit sometime after Melisandre's departure from Dragonstone to gather power on the mainland. Selyse tries to dissuade Stannis from seeing Shireen, but he angrily insists upon seeing his daughter. While telling her of the disaster at Blackwater Bay, Shireen asks for Davos Seaworth, calling him by his traditional soubriquet, "The Onion Knight". Stannis gently explains that he is a traitor and is in the dungeon, a notion which distresses the young princess. Advising her to forget her friend, Stannis departs.
            Later that night, Shireen sneaks out of her tower and into the dungeon to see Davos. She demonstrates knowledge of the guards and their habits, making sure to visit when the gaoler, a known drunk, is on duty. Shireen brings Davos a book about Aegon the Conqueror to pass the time, but the Onion Knight admits he cannot read. Shireen takes this in stride and begins to teach him through the bars of his cell.[2]
            Following Ser Davos's release, he spends time with Shireen. She implores him to read more of Aegon's exploits rather than sort through Stannis's correspondence, which consists mostly of invitations to attend social events thrown by his few remaining bannermen, including the nameday celebration of one of Shireen's Florent cousins. When a confused Davos asks why there is a "G" in the word "night", Shireen shrugs off the unusual spelling. Davos's newfound knowledge is what ultimately leads to Stannis deciding to head to the Wall to aid the Night's Watch against Mance Rayder.[3]
            Selyse fears for Shireen's soul, saying that she is stubborn, sinful and sullen. She expresses a desire to strike her with a rod, which Stannis forbids. Selyse suggests that Melisandre speak to Shireen. Melisandre goes to visit her and Shireen makes clear her disapproval of Melisandre burning people, including her uncle Ser Axell Florent. Melisandre tells her that the tales told in the Seven-Pointed Star are lies and fables and that the only true gods are R'hllor and the Great Other, with the only hell being the one they live in now.[4]
            Later, Shireen continues her reading lessons with Ser Davos in her chambers, where he joins her after a tense meeting with her father. She scolds him for being late, and insists that he won't make a very good Hand of the King if he sees the word "knight" and says "ka-nigit". He says that she certainly is her father's daughter, as they are both relentless. She gives him a new book which she says is more complex, The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas, First Sword of Braavos. She chides him for moving his lips when he reads because that's how children do it, then claps her hands in congratulations when he reads the title correctly. Shireen says she enjoys this book because it is filled with pirates and swordfights.
            Davos explains that he has been to Braavos, during his smuggling days, but he nearly lost his life when he ran afoul of the First Sword who was protecting the ships of the Iron Bank of Braavos. Davos says that's to be expected, though, given that the ships of the Iron Bank transport a nation's worth of gold - at which point realization suddenly dawns on him. Davos kisses Shireen on the forehead for having helped him figure it out and asks her to write a letter to the Iron Bank. She protests that he really should because it is good practice, but says that it is very important, so he must make sure that it is written properly by someone smart. He proceeds to dictate a letter requesting for an audience with the Iron Bank, to ask them to switch their support from the Lannisters to her father. He has her address the letter as if she was actually her father, and she asks if they should do that: Davos says it is fine (given that he is Stannis's Hand) and that addressing the letter as "from King Stannis" is just to get the Bank's attention.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Shireen_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemShireenBaratheon</string></dict>

        <key>Yara Greyjoy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.27.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Yara Greyjoy is an ironborn, Theon Greyjoy's older sister and his only surviving sibling. She was raised at Pyke, the stronghold of House Greyjoy. Yara is a fierce warrior and commands her own longship. She is currently a claimant to the throne of the Kingdom of the Iron Islands and an ally of Daenerys Targaryen, despite being captured and taken prisoner by her uncle, Euron Greyjoy, during the assault on the Targaryen Fleet.
            Yara is captain of her own longship, the Black Wind.
            Yara is the only daughter of Lord Balon and his wife, Lady Alannys of House Harlaw. Balon is the head of House Greyjoy and the Lord of the Iron Islands. The Iron Islands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Greyjoy is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Greyjoy rules the region from their seat at Pyke and Balon also holds the title Lord Reaper of Pyke.
            Yara was born and raised at Pyke. She was Balon and Alannys's third child after Rodrik and Maron. She also has a younger brother, Theon. Eight years before the start of the series, Balon rose in rebellion against the Iron Throne and was defeated in a bloody war. Balon's two older sons were killed and Theon was taken by Lord Eddard Stark as a hostage for Balon's good behavior and obedience.[1] With Yara as Balon's only remaining child in the Iron Islands, he raised her as a surrogate son, encouraging her to become a reaver in her own right, which is unusual for women in the patriarchal culture of the ironborn. She is a fierce warrior and commands her own longship, to the disquiet of some of the ironborn who hold that women should not fight or command men in battle.[2]
            Theon has returned to Pyke as an envoy from King Robb Stark. Yara rides out to greet him, posing as a commoner to get the measure of her brother. She offers him a lift on her horse up to the castle Pyke. He does not recognize her and is relentless in his attempts to seduce her. He presents Robb's suggested alliance to their father, Balon Greyjoy. Balon roundly rejects the terms, insisting that he is ironborn and will seize his crown. He compares Theon unfavorably to Yara, revealing her identity. He says that Yara will lead his assault.[3] Balon details a plan to attack the poorly defended north while Robb is distracted by his war with House Lannister. Yara is assigned thirty ships to seize Deepwood Motte, the stronghold of House Glover, while Theon is given a single ship to raid fishing villages along the Stony Shore. Theon is baptized by a Drowned Priest on the shores of Pyke in a show of loyalty to his blood relatives. Balon and Yara watch as he proclaims his faith in the Drowned God.[4]
            Yara assembles her ships at Red Harbor. She rides to Lordsport to reach her fleet and encounters Theon struggling to command his unruly crew. She seizes the opportunity to mock him again. Her men would wait a year for her if need be, but Theon's crew is not loyal to him.[5]
            Yara's force takes Deepwood Motte as planned, but Theon ignores his orders and captures Winterfell instead by luring the garrison out to defend Torrhen's Square. He writes to Yara to request reinforcements to hold the castle. He announces to the assembled people of Winterfell that she will be sending him 500 men.[6]
            She learns that he has executed Bran Stark and Rickon Stark (who were actually two orphans from the farm) for attempting to escape captivity. She rides to Winterfell with only twenty men and tries to convince Theon to return home with her to avoid retribution from Robb Stark, but fails.[7] Theon is subsequently captured by House Bolton.
            Following the events of the Red Wedding and Roose Bolton's ascent to Warden of the North, Roose's bastard son and Theon's torturer Ramsay Snow sends a letter and a box containing Theon's genitals to Pyke.
            In the letter, Ramsay demands that Yara's father order all ironborn to leave the North by the first night of the full moon under threat of flaying all of them alive and further torture and mutilation to Theon. Balon refuses to yield the lands and castles taken by the ironborn and dismisses Theon for having disobeyed him and for no longer "being a man" and unable to continue the Greyjoy line with children of his own. Yara, however, decides to take the fastest ship of the Iron Fleet along with the 50 best killers of the Isles, sail up the Narrow Sea and into the Weeping Water, with the intention of marching against the Dreadfort to rescue her brother and bring him home.[8]
            Yara carries out her intentions of sailing to rescue Theon. She utilizes longboats and canoes to get upriver and approach the Dreadfort, and she and the ironborn soldiers use grappling hooks to scale the walls and find out where Theon is being held. However, when they enter the kennels where he is sleeping, Theon, believing it to be another one of Ramsay's psychological mind games, claims he is Reek and refuses to go. Ramsay enters with some guards, and in the ensuing fight most of both sides are killed. Yara offers Ramsay his life if he surrenders Theon, but Ramsay instead releases his hounds and the Ironborn are forced to retreat without Theon. Once back to the boats, Yara claims her brother is dead.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Yara_Greyjoy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemYaraGreyjoy</string></dict>

            Unella grabs Cersei Lannister when she is arrested by the High Sparrow and throws her into a cell underneath the Great Sept of Baelor with the aid of Moelle and Scolera.[1]
            Unella routinely visits Cersei in her cell and offers her a ladle of water on the condition that she confess. Cersei, prideful and infuriated, refuses Unella's advances, repeating to the septa that her face will be the last one she sees before she dies.[2]
            Eventually, however, Cersei gives in and confesses her adultery with her cousin Lancel. The High Sparrow allows Cersei to return to the Red Keep in order to be with her son King Tommen, but first she must perform a walk of atonement. Unella is present when Cersei is stripped naked and washed by two other septas before her hair is roughly cut short. She later accompanies Cersei as she is forced to walk naked from the Great Sept of Baelor to the Red Keep with a handful of Faith Militant members to keep away the leering and jeering crowds who have gathered to see her shame and take the chance to insult a Queen. As she walks, Septa Unella accompanies her crying out "Shame!" repeatedly while ringing a bell to attract the attention of the population.[3]
            While Septa Unella reads from the Seven Pointed Star regarding sin to an imprisoned Margaery Tyrell, the latter inquires about her brother Loras Tyrell's condition, who was likewise imprisoned. However, Unella says she must confess her sins first. When the Queen demands to know the condition her brother is in, the septa moves to strike her, much to Margaery's horror. At that precise moment, the High Sparrow steps in and stops Unella, ordering his acolyte to attend the Faith's 'other guests'. After the septa leaves, he admits that at times Septa Unella takes her devotion too far.[4]
            Some time later, Unella brings Margaery to the High Sparrow. When Margaery correctly recognizes the High Sparrow paraphrasing his life from the Book of the Stranger, he expresses surprise, and Margaery explains that Unella frequently reads the Book at her. The High Sparrow chuckles and agrees that Unella has a habit of reading at people instead of to them.[5]
            Unella is present on the steps of the Great Sept as Margaery is about to do her walk of atonement, likely with the intent of again ringing the bell. She remains silent throughout the Tyrell army's aborted rescue attempt and Tommen's announcement of a new alliance between the Faith and the Crown.[6]
            Unella has apparently been assigned to watch over Queen Margaery non-stop. The septa is naturally present when Olenna and her granddaughter are finally reunited, much to the Tyrell matriarch's ire. The Queen Of Thorns wastes no time in telling Unella off and even tries to intimidate her.
            Unella is made of sterner stuff though and remains implacable. When Margaery reveals she is 'truly' devoted to the Faith, to her grandmother's shock a hint of a smile appears across Unella's lips.[7]
            After the destruction of the Sept of Baelor with Wildfire, Cersei has Unella imprisoned within the Red Keep's dungeons and restrained on a rack. After tormenting Unella by pouring wine on her face, the Queen confesses that she killed Robert Baratheon, that she had commited incest with her brother and bore his children, and that she destroyed the Sept, killing the High Sparrow and the Faith Militant. Cersei accuses Unella of not truly caring about Cersei's atonement when Cersei was imprisoned by the Faith Militant; rather, Unella tortured Cersei solely for her own sick satisfaction. Cersei then reminds Unella that she told her that her face would be the last thing she sees before she dies, and Unella responds that she is ready to die today. However, Cersei taunts her that she will not actually die today, not for a very long time (she intends to have her slowly tortured). She then introduces Unella to Ser Gregor Clegane and leaves the two inside the cell, as Unella screams in horror when she sees what is beneath Gregor's helmet. As Cersei locks the door and leaves she mockingly chants "Shame! Shame! Shame!", as Unella once did during the Queen's walk of atonement.[8]
            Septa Unella wasn't referred to by name in on-screen dialogue when she debuted in Season 5, though the HBO Viewer's Guide clearly identified her in its character entries. Her name was first given in on-screen dialogue in the Season 6 premiere.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Septa Unella is described as big boned with callused hands and a scowling homely face. She is a member of the Most Devout, a council of septons and septas that rule the Faith of the Seven under the leadership of the High Septon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Unella</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemUnella</string></dict>
        <key>Elsera Snow</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.29.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elsera Snow is the bastard daughter of Lord Gregor Forrester and the sister of Josera Snow, both of whom live in the North Grove. She is a witch capable of performing blood magic rituals. She also controls an army of wildling warriors, that are heavily implied to be undead.
            Elsera and Josera were the bastard children sired by Lord Gregor Forrester. Keeping them a secret from his household, Gregor sent them beyond the Wall to the North Grove to protect it. While Josera believed that their father sent them away out of shame, Elsera believed that it was in fact the contrary, that their father sent his bastards away to protect them and their gifts.
            As they approach the North Grove, Gared, Cotter, and Sylvi are attacked by Josera's snow bear, Shadow. They manage to fend it off long enough to reach the grove, where Elsera forces him to stop attacking the group. The three newcomers are held at knifepoint, until Gared reveals that he was sent by House Forrester. Josera disbelieves his claim, even after he presents proof, but Elsera urges her brother to trust the squire. The two give their names, and Gared then reveals that he came to the North Grove because of Gregor's last words him. Gregor's bastards are shocked to learn of their father's death, and while Josera is angered that Gared doesn't know their identity, Elsera managed to calm him. Before they have time to talk further, the group learns of wights approaching the grove and move to defend it. The siblings has Sylvi tied up, but Gared can convince them to free her. They then move to confront the threat.
            Back in the Grove, Elsera invites Gared to join her because she has something to show him. Following the woman to a ceremony room, Gared discovered an agonizing Cotter laying there. Elsera told Gared that she had done everything she could but that it was to late to save him. Elsera then let Gared choose Cotter's fate, to give him the nightshade to end his suffering or to help her rip his beating heart during a ritual to harness the power of the Grove. If Gared chooses to euthanize Cotter, one of Elsera's soldier will attack her and she will be forced to kill her.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Elsera_Snow</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemElseraSnow</string></dict>
        <key>Elia Martell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.30.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Princess Elia Martell was the sister of Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne and head of House Martell, and Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper. She was married to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, heir to Aerys II, and bore him two children: Rhaenys and Aegon. She and her children were killed by Ser Gregor Clegane on the orders of Lord Tywin Lannister during the Sack of King's Landing at the end of Robert's Rebellion.
            When she was a child, Elia accompanied her mother and brother Oberyn on a visit to Casterly Rock. While there, Elia and Oberyn were eager to see the monster that had just been born. Cersei finally showed them the baby, but the Martell siblings were somewhat disappointed to see that Tyrion was just a baby, and somewhat disturbed by Cersei's already strong hatred of him.[4]
            According to her family, Elia loved her husband Prince Rhaegar dearly. She bore him two children, Rhaenys and Aegon, to whom she was equally devoted; according to Oberyn, Elia took care of them from birth, rather than delegating the task to a wet nurse.[5] Both pregnancies were very difficult, and each nearly killed Elia.[6]
            When Robert's Rebellion erupted, Elia was retained in King's Landing by King Aerys to ensure the loyalty of House Martell during the conflict- a measure the Martells considered unnecessary, as they would always fight for whichever side Elia was on and had no intention of breaking their oaths of loyalty to the Targaryens. Ultimately Rhaegar was killed in personal combat with Robert Baratheon at the Battle of the Trident, leaving Elia a widow. A few weeks later during the Sack of King's Landing, Tywin Lannister's army betrayed the Targaryens and overran the city. Ser Gregor Clegane - known as "The Mountain That Rides" - burst into the royal chambers and before Elia's eyes, bashed her infant son's head against a wall, killing him instantly. Rhaneys was killed after she was found hiding under Rhaegar's bed. Covered in the blood and gore of her children, the Mountain proceeded to brutally rape Elia, and finally he killed her by cutting her in two with a sword.
            Elia's death deeply alienated her family from the crown after Robert ascended the throne, and their hatred of the Lannisters now knew no bounds. Subsequently, they were never seen and rarely if ever mentioned at the royal court in King's Landing.[7]
            Elia is mentioned many times by her brother Oberyn in his conversations with various members of House Lannister. It is clear that Oberyn loved his older sister very much.[5] When speaking to Tyrion, Oberyn expresses apparent anger that "beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman" despite Elia's love and loyalty for Rhaegar. Oberyn tells Cersei that his fifth daughter is named for her, and that he finds it difficult to interact with her as a result.[8]
            After the assassination of King Joffrey, Tywin Lannister approaches Oberyn to determine if he had a hand in it, considering his hatred for House Lannister. Oberyn confirms that he blames Tywin for the deaths of Elia and her children, which Tywin cryptically suggests was all the Mountain's doing. He offers Oberyn an opportunity to confront the Mountain privately on the condition that he first preside as the third judge at Tyrion's court trial for Joffrey's murder, which Oberyn agrees to do.[9]
            However, when Tyrion later demands a trial by combat, Oberyn volunteers to be Tyrion's champion after learning that the Mountain will be fighting for the Crown, hoping he will finally have vengeance for rape and murder of his sister.[4]
            As the two champions commence battle at the trial, Oberyn identifies himself to the Mountain as the brother of Elia and reminds his opponent of the crime he committed against House Martell, saying, "You raped my sister, you murdered her, you killed her children." Despite wearing light armor and drinking before their fight, Oberyn initially gains the upper hand and proceeds to slowly cut down the Mountain all the while shouting in an ever louder voice, "You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!" Thinking his opponent to be fully incapacitated, Oberyn again demands the Mountain confess his crime and reveal who gave him the order, pointing accusingly at Tywin. However, in his hubris Oberyn is unexpectedly caught off guard when the Mountain suddenly trips him up. Berserk with fury at nearly being killed by his opponent, the Mountain pins Oberyn to the ground and proceeds to gouge out his eyeballs, making him scream in agony, as he roars for all to hear, "Elia Martell! I killed her children! Then I raped her! Then I smashed her head...in like this!" He then crushes Oberyn's skull, effectively confirming the long-standing rumor of arguably his most infamous war crime.[10]
            During her coup d'etat in Dorne, Ellaria Sand cites the butchering of Elia, as well as Oberyn Martell, as one of the reasons she murders Prince Doran Martell. Ellaria and the Sand Snakes seek to avenge Elia and Oberyn despite having just murdered Elia and Oberyn's brother and nephew, Trystane Martell, both of whom refused to go to war with House Lannister.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Elia_Martell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemEliaMartell</string></dict>
        <key>Elia Sand</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.31.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elia Sand is a bastard daughter of Prince Oberyn Martell and one of the Sand Snakes.
            Elia Sand is the fifth of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the "Sand Snakes". Her mother is Oberyn's paramour, Ellaria Sand. She was named after her aunt, the late Princess Elia Martell.[1]
            Oberyn writes a poem to Elia and mentions her willful behavior to Queen Cersei Lannister. He explains that he named her after his murdered sister, but this ended up making him sad when he talks to her, which in turn leads to him being angry around her. Cersei, in a rare moment of genuine motherly insight, suggests that this may be the cause of her behavior.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Elia Sand is fourteen years old. She is described as wearing her black hair in a braid and having her father's eyes. She's fond of horses and jousting, for which she often smells like a horse to her mother's despair. Her weapon of choice is the lance, for which she's dubbed "Lady Lance". Her mother affectionately refers to her as "El". Although she is the first of the younger Sand Snakes, she is just old enough to spend time with her older sisters and share their rapport with their cousin, Arianne Martell.
            After Prince Doran hears the plans that the three elder Sand Snakes have in mind to avenge their father, he arrests them lest they ignite a war with the Lannisters. Ellaria and her daughters, including Elia, are placed under house arrest in the Water Gardens, lest they be used in plots against Doran or the Lannisters. Following the arrival of Ser Balon Swann, Doran reveals his true colors to the elder Sand Snakes and releases Elia, her mother and sisters.
            Currently, according to Arianne's sample chapters from the sixth novel, Elia accompanies her cousin on a mission to meet potential allies.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Elia_Sand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemEliaSand</string></dict>
        <key>Ellaria Sand</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.32.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ellaria Sand was the paramour of Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne and a bastard of House Uller, carrying the bastard surname "Sand" like all bastards in Dorne.
            After Oberyn's death while defending Tyrion Lannister in a trial by combat, Ellaria pushes for House Martell to go to war with House Lannister, but is refused by Oberyn's older brother, Doran Martell. In retaliation, Ellaria and the Sand Snakes murder Doran's ward, Myrcella Baratheon, and eventually Doran himself and his son, Trystane Martell. They usurp power in Dorne, pledging the army of House Martell to Daenerys Targaryen. After an attack on the Targaryen fleet, however, Ellaria is captured by Euron Greyjoy alongside her daughter Tyene Sand and Yara Greyjoy, and is delivered to Cersei as Euron's gift. She is sentenced to life in prison in the dungeons of the Red Keep for Myrcella's murder, and is forced to watch as Cersei fatally poisons Tyene, with the same poison Ellaria used to murder Myrcella.
            Ellaria is the mother of four of Prince Oberyn Martell's eight bastard daughters. Her eldest daughter is Tyene. Like Oberyn, Ellaria is attracted to both men and women.[1]
            After their arrival in King's Landing, Ellaria and her lover, Prince Oberyn Martell, head to one of Littlefinger's brothels. Oberyn examines three whores while Ellaria lies on the bed, asking her which one she would like. She says that she doesn't want a timid one and he eventually finds one to her liking. When Olyvar calls Ellaria "my lady", she calls him out for using a lie to address her and tells him to call her what she is: a bastard. When Oberyn hears men singing the Rains of Castamere in the next room, Ellaria tries to stop him but can only watch as Oberyn takes out his rage on the Lannister men-at-arms. She proceeds to passionately kiss him as Tyrion Lannister and Bronn enter the room seeking Oberyn.[2]
            Ellaria and Oberyn attend Joffrey's wedding, where she is introduced to Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister. Cersei subtly mocks her bastard status, instigating a debate over the cultural differences between the Dornish and the rest of Westeros. She and Oberyn later witness the poisoning of King Joffrey.[3]
            In the days following Joffrey's death, Ellaria and Oberyn again visit the brothel. On this occasion, Ellaria is serviced by Marei and another woman; Ellaria steals a kiss from Olyvar, who apologizes and says he simply hasn't developed the taste for women.
            Ellaria soothes Oberyn's anger at the suggestion that she is an "acquired taste", by reminding him that this means he has Olyvar to himself. Ellaria leaves when Lord Tywin unexpectedly shows up and asks to meet privately with Oberyn, but says that Oberyn need only call if he needs her.[4]
            During Tyrion's trial by combat, Ellaria, in spite of having heard tales of the Mountain for years, is somewhat disturbed to see exactly how large he really is, expressing with disbelief, "you're going to fight that?!".Just before the battle,she pulls Oberyn into a passionate kiss and warns Oberyn not to leave her alone in the world. Ellaria watches with Tyrion from the sidelines and is delighted when it looks like Oberyn has won. When Oberyn demands that Gregor confess his crimes before he dies, he meets Ellaria's eyes and she nods approvingly. Her delight turns to shock and horror when the Mountain, acting dead,trips Oberyn by the foot and punches him in the face,knocking out many teeth in the process.The Mountain then pressed his fingers onto Oberyn's eyes and crushes his skull, at which she can do nothing but scream.[5]
            At the Water Gardens, Ellaria, still in mourning clothes, observes Trystane Martell and Myrcella Baratheon from a distance. She approaches Prince Doran Martell, but her path is initially blocked by Captain Areo Hotah. Ellaria threatens Areo before the captain is ordered by Doran to stand down. Angrily, Ellaria scolds Doran for his apparent inaction at the news of Oberyn's death. Doran plans to bury and mourn his beloved brother, but Ellaria and Oberyn's daughters want the Dornish people to take up arms and avenge their fallen prince. She also voices her contempt for Myrcella and wants to harm her in order to take revenge on Cersei, who she deems responsible for Oberyn's death by falsely accusing Tyrion of Joffrey's murder in the first place. Doran strictly forbids this, stating that under his rule, they will not mutilate little girls for revenge. Ellaria voices doubts that Doran will remain in power if he continues to do nothing and leaves.[6]
            She later meets with Obara, Nymeria, and her daughter Tyene, telling them that Doran will mourn for Oberyn but won't do anything. As Obara points out that they have no army without the support of the Prince to challenge the Lannisters, Ellaria says that they won't need an army because they have Myrcella, despite Oberyn's earlier promise that they would never harm her. Nymeria informs her that there's perhaps a problem, presenting her the merchant captain who smuggled Jaime Lannister to Dorne and tried to sell this information to Obara, just to end up buried in the sand.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ellaria_Sand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemEllariaSand</string></dict>
        <key>Elaena Glenmore</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.33.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elaena Glenmore is the oldest and only daughter of Lord Glenmore and is betrothed to Rodrik Forrester.
            Elaena is the betrothed of Rodrik Forrester, and the two have known each other since they were young. They played hide-and-seek in the grove, where Elaena would always hide behind the same tree so Rodrik would find her.
            If Mira had forged a note to Elaena from Margaery Tyrell, Elaena will feel like she's being coerced into marrying Rodrik, but can be convinced by allowing her to make her own choice. Alternatively, if Mira did not forge the letter, Rodrik can offer half of the Forresters' ironwood to satisfy the Glenmores.
            Elaena appears in the Ironwood Grove while Royland and Rodrik are training to fight despite his injured leg. She appears with her brother Arthur and the Glenmore Elite Guard. She tells Rodrik that the betrothal between them (if it was secured) will not carry on due to Ludd Whitehill paying Elaena's father a visit and convincing him to have Elaena Glenmore marry Gryff Whitehill. Her brother Arthur is also shocked by Lord Glenmore accepting the offer and says that the Glenmore Elite Guard is Rodrik's if Gryff is taken down. Rodrik can promise Elaena to kill Gryff or not, either way -- you aren't able to.
            If Rodrik offered to keep Elaena company, she is later seen in his bed. They imply that they've been sleeping together for several weeks, and talk about what the future holds for them. If Rodrik tells her to return to her family, Elaena says that she can never go back, as she worries that her father will blame her for Arthur's death. Talia then interrupts their conversation with important information for Rodrik. Embarassed, Elaena covers herself with a sheet and exits the room.
            Elaena later joins the rest of the Forrester household in meeting Ludd Whitehill and his army at the gates of Ironrath. After demanding Asher's surrender, Ludd returns Rodrik's body as a token of his goodwill. Elaena gives the corpse of her lover a brief, mournful look before walking away. She is not seen for the rest of the episode, leaving it unknown as to whether she escaped the Battle of Ironrath or was captured by the Whitehills.
            If Rodrik survived the ambush, Elaena happily greets him when he returns to Ironrath. She stands by as he convinces the pit fighters to stay loyal to him and rallies the smallfolk to prepare for battle.
            Despite the Forresters' best efforts, Ironrath eventually falls to the Whitehills. If Elaena was allowed to stay, she is captured by Whitehill soldiers and dragged out of the castle. A heavily wounded Rodrik sees this and attempts to help her, but is unable to muster the strength to move, leaving her fate unknown.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Elaena_Glenmore</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemElaenaGlenmore</string></dict>

            Four more keeps Durran built and lost to the fury of the gods. Finally, the seventh castle, which Durran built with the aid of Bran the Builder, withstood the rage of the Elenei's parents and became known as Storm's End, while Durran earned the nickname of "Durran's Godsgrief."[1][2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Elenei</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemElenei</string></dict>
        <key>Elissa Forrester</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.35.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elissa Forrester, née Branfield, was the widow of Gregor Forrester and matriarch of House Forrester.
            Elissa Forrester was born into House Branfield, a minor Southron house that was destroyed when the Targaryen dynasty fell. She had been married to Gregor for many years when Robert's Rebellion signaled her family's demise; yet she nonetheless felt conflicted between her father's loyalties and her husband's. In time, Elissa came to feel that Ironrath, and she embraced her role as the Forrester matriarch. She silently sworn that she'll never see her family destroyed again.[1]
            They had several children together: Rodrik, Asher and Mira. During her fourth pregnancy, she dreamed she would birth a daughter with a voice like summer rain. But as destiny would have it, she gave birth to a boy. The infant, Ethan, wailed for hours - until Lady Elissa entered a second labor, this time birthing a girl. She named the girl Talia, after her own mother, and from then on Ethan never cried again. She gave birth to one more son a few years later, Ryon.[2][3]
            Her son, Asher, later went into self-exile in Essos to stop a war being started over his love for Gwyn Whitehill.[4] Lady Elissa wanted her eldest daughter - Mira - to learn the ways of a southern court, so arranged for her to serve as a handmaiden for Margaery Tyrell.[5]
            Gared Tuttle, Gregor's squire returns from The Twins, bearing news that Gregor and Rodrik have been slain in the Red Wedding. He returns Gregor's Greatsword. Her son, Ethan is made the new Lord of Ironrath and Elissa attends his council meetings, giving him advice and helping to keep Ser Royland Degore and Duncan Tuttle from bickering.
            They soon encounter problems from House Whitehill, who desire their Ironwood forests.Lord Whitehill had been a childhood friend of Roose Bolton and plans to take all of House Forresters Ironwood, robbing them of their greatest asset. Lord Whitehill is received by Ethan in the Great Hall and quickly begins antagonizing the young boy. Lady Elissa arrives and reminds him to show her son some respect as they are in his home.
            She writes to her daughter, Mira, in King's Landing asking her to try and convince Lady Margaery to use her influence in court to convince King Joffrey to let House Forrester keep their Ironwood forests, overruling whatever House Bolton would decide, as Lord Whitehill planned to go to them, as House Forrester's new liege lords, so they could relinquish House Forrester's rights to the Ironwood forests and hand them over to House Whitehill.
            Behind her son's back she arranges for her brother, Malcolm, to sail to Essos to find Asher and bring him back. She claims Asher has no interest in becoming lord, but could lead men in battle should a war begin between the Forresters and the Whitehills. Ethan can either agree with this plan or refuse it.
            When Ramsay Snow arrives with Lord Whitehill to discuss distributing control over the Ironwood forests, Elissa is present alongside Talia and Ryon. Ramsay takes glee in first taunting Ryon and then seems keen to take Talia on "a hunt". Due to Ethan's response to this, Ramsay stabs him in the throat. Elissa runs to her son's side and he bleeds out as she cradles his body. She calls out for her son as Lord Whitehill drags Ryon away as his captive.[6]
            She is informed that Rodrik was found alive and rolled in on a corpse cart alongside the dead body of her husband, Gregor. She visits Rodrik as Maester Ortengryn works on healing him, but Rodrik passes out shortly after she arrives.
            While Rodrik is passed out, Elissa tells Talia to write a song for Ethan and Gregor, to sing at their upcoming funeral. Elissa then quickly sends a letter to Mira in King's Landing, asking for help in ensuring Elaena Glenmore and Rodrik's marriage remains intact, wanting Mira to convince Lady Margaery to send a letter to House Glenmore and "encourage" the marriage.
            Once Rodrik begins to recover and is able to walk again, she sees him in the Great Hall, where she informs him that she has invited his betrothed - Lady Elaena Glenmore - to visit him. When Lady Elaena arrives, Elissa gives Rodrik some advice on how to convince her to honor the betrothal despite the undesirable state Rodrik and House Forrester is in. She returns to the Great Hall after Lady Elaena has made her decision and Lord Whitehill makes an unexpected and unwelcome arrival. He demands Rodrik shows him some respect by kneeling and kissing his ring, only agreeing to release Ryon temporarily to attend the funeral of Ethan and Gregor if he does. Desperate to see her youngest son, Elissa advises Rodrik to swallow his pride and kiss Whitehill's ring. Whitehill then overrules, Rodrik by taking all the Ironwood forests, defying House Bolton in the process as well.
            Lady Elissa attends the funeral of her son, Ethan, and husband, Gregor. If Gwyn Whitehill attends the funeral, Elissa will exhibit her distaste for her in secret to Rodrik. In private, she and Rodrik discuss what to do about the Whitehills. Lady Elissa tells her son that he mustn't let anything stand in his way, even if he has to "murder ever last Whitehill, down to the babes in their bed". She then listens to Talia's song for the fallen family members.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Elissa_Forrester</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemElissaForrester</string></dict>

            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aemma Arryn was the daughter of Lord Rodrik Arryn and his wife Princess Daella Targaryen, who was herself the daughter of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and his sister-wife Alysanne Targaryen. In 93 AC she married her cousin Viserys I Targaryen, who ascended to the Iron Throne following the death of her grandfather, as he had been chosen as the heir to the throne during the Great Council of 101 AC.
            She became pregnant several times during the early years of their marriage, but suffered several miscarriages and gave birth to one son who later died in the cradle. She eventually gave birth to a healthy daughter, Rhaenyra, in 97 AC, and both of her parents adored her. Aemma became pregnant again in 105 AC, though she died in childbirth and her son Baelon died the following day.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aemma_Arryn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemAemmaArryn</string></dict>

        <key>Falyse Stokeworth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.41.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Falyse Stokeworth is the eldest daughter of House Stokeworth and heir to Castle Stokeworth.
            "Falyse" is pronounced "Fahl-lease".
            Falyse crops up in a conversation between Tyrion Lannister and Bronn, when the latter visits Tyrion in his cell while awaiting his trial. Bronn reveals that Cersei Lannister has arranged a marriage between him and Falyse's younger sister Lollys in a successful effort to sway the ambitious ex-sellsword from Tyrion's service. Tyrion points out that Falyse, not Lollys, is the heir to House Stokeworth and their castle. Bronn has apparently already considered this, and remarks that Falyse is barren and should she perish before her father, Lollys would become the heir.[1]
            Lollys Stokeworth and her newly betrothed Ser Bronn of the Blackwater walk on the grounds outside the castle, as Lollys talks excitedly about plans for their upcoming wedding. Bronn muses that he never thought he'd end up settling down in a fine a place as this. Confused, Lollys corrects him that after her mother (Tanda Stokeworth) dies, the castle will pass to her sister, because she is older than Lollys. She also says that her sister hates her, calls her names, and even still she pulls Lollys's hair when she thinks their mother isn't looking. Bronn assures Lollys that her sister is mean, and mean people always end up getting what's coming to them - clearly still holding to his plan to surreptitiously kill off Falyse after he marries Lollys.
            They then see that Jaime Lannister has arrived at the castle. He privately informs Bronn that he needs him to accompany a secret mission he is taking to Dorne. To encourage Bronn to go, the Lannisters have now promised Lollys to Wyllis Bracken: Jaime vaguely promises that they will find Bronn a better bride with an even bigger castle, though Bronn is not amused.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Falyse is known to have an acid tongue. She is described as looking like a fish and drinking like one too, being quite fond of hippocras. She has been married to Ser Balman Byrch for ten years, but they remain childless. It is rumored that he shuns her bed.
            She attends the tournament on King Joffrey Baratheon's nameday with her mother Lady Tanda and her sister Lollys. She arrives in King's Landing with a small troop of soldiers the day before the Battle of the Blackwater. During the battle she stays with her sister and mother in Maegor's Holdfast.
            In the wake of Tywin's death and Tyrion's escape, Cersei paranoidly believes that despite buying him off with the marriage to Lollys, Bronn remains loyal to Tyrion and persuades Falyse and her husband to kill him. Cersei had hoped they would arrange a 'hunting accident' in the same way she arranged Robert's death, but instead Balman challenges Bronn to single combat, arrogantly believing that as a knight, he can get the better of the former sellsword. Unfortunately, Balman and Falyse severely underestimate Bronn; with his usual pragmatism, Bronn kills Balman's horse in their duel, causing the dying animal to crush Balman's legs beneath it when it falls. Bronn then kills Balman after torturing a confession out of Balman that Cersei was behind the attempt on his life, then threatens to do the same to Falyse if she is not gone from Castle Stokeworth by morning, though only after letting the castle garrison gang-rape her. When Falyse orders Bronn seized, the castle guards reveal they are loyal to Bronn, bluntly advising her to "do as Lord Stokeworth says".
            Falyse returns to King's Landing to beg Cersei for soldiers to retake her castle, but a furious Cersei refuses, berating Falyse and her husband for failing their task so spectacularly. Worried her position will be undermined if word of her involvement in the attempted assassination gets out, Cersei hands Falyse over to Qyburn, who uses her in his experiments until she finally dies.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Falyse_Stokeworth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemFalyseStokeworth</string></dict>

            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, some of Lord Walder's descendants name their offspring Walder or Walda to incur Lord Walder's favor - a custom the Lord of the Crossing finds annoying.

        <key>Tysha</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.44.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tysha is the former wife of Tyrion Lannister.
            When Tyrion Lannister was sixteen years old, he met an orphaned wheelwright's daughter on the road, apparently the victim of an attempted rape. While his brother, Jaime, rode off after the attackers, Tyrion helped Tysha recover from the ordeal, and they became lovers. They found a drunk septon willing to marry them in exchange for a bribe and briefly, they lived as husband and wife for two weeks, until Tyrion's father Lord Tywin learned what had happened when the septon told him after he had sobered up. Jaime confessed that he organized the incident to do something nice for his little brother, and Tysha was actually a prostitute. Jaime thought it was time that Tyrion had sex with a girl, and paid Tysha and the would-be rapers to pretend it was real so Tyrion would think a girl genuinely wanted to have sex with him without having to pay for it. However, Jaime did not anticipate that Tyrion would marry the girl, nor what their father's reaction would be to that. In a fury that his son would dare to marry a commoner, Tywin had his guards gang-rape Tysha while Tyrion was forced to watch. Tywin sarcastically had the guards pay Tysha by dropping a silver coin in her hand for each man who took her. By the end, there were so many silver coins that the pile was slipping out of her hand and coins were rolling along the floor. She was then sent on her way, and Tyrion never heard of her again.[1]
            Since this incident, Tyrion has disdained love and romance in favor of liaisons with prostitutes for money.
            At the Lannister battle camp, prior to the Battle of the Green Fork, Tyrion Lannister is playing a drinking game with Bronn and Shae, when Bronn mentions that he overheard while playing dice with some Lannister guardsmen that Tyrion was married once. Tyrion then explains the story of his marriage to Tysha. Bronn comments "I would have killed the man who did that to me".[1]
            Prior to the Battle of the Blackwater, Tyrion's sister Cersei intends to take petty revenge on Tyrion, by capturing the new whore that he has fallen in love with and taken to King's Landing with him. For a moment Tyrion thinks that she has captured his lover Shae, though it is quickly revealed that she captured the wrong whore, mistaking that Ros was his lover. Cersei gloats at Tyrion, referencing the past incident with Tysha.[2]
            Tywin forced Tyrion into an arranged marriage with the young Sansa Stark, remarking that it is past time that Tyrion was married. Tyrion angrily snaps back that he was married once, unless Tywin has forgotten. Tywin coldly says that he has not.[3]
            Later, when Tyrion is commiserating about his situation with Bronn, the sellsword advises him that it is not the worst situation. Tyrion says that Shae - a whore who became his lover and secretly brought to the capital - will not be happy about his marriage to Sansa. Bronn sarcastically reminds Tyrion what happened the first time he married a whore, prompting Tyrion to lament telling him about that.[4]
            Bryan Cogman stated in his Twitter account that originally, in Season 1's "Baelor", the showrunners never intended to include the scene in which Tyrion explains his backstory with Tysha in Season 1 - keeping in mind that at the time, they thought they would be lucky to get renewed for a second season, so they didn't want to waste time introducing many plot elements that would only pay off in the future if they had no guarantee they'd even get another season. At the time, they did plan on giving the backstory about Tysha in Season 2, in the event that the show was renewed. As it happened, because the runtime of Season 1 came up short, they realized it was a great scene to put back in (also because it was a small, intimate scene only involving a few characters and wouldn't take much more time to set up). Cogman is also convinced that Dinklage's emotional performance in this Tysha backstory scene is what won him his Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in Season 1.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tysha is the orphaned daughter of a crofter, not a wheelwright's daughter. Tyrion recounts the story in a very similar manner to the series. He does not tell the story to Bronn and Shae together, but to each of them separately on two different occasions. However, in the series he omits the detail that he was forced to join in the gang rape on pain of his father's wrath to complete his own humiliation. It is also implied he couldn't avoid becoming aroused. Tyrion does not mention Tysha's name when telling the story, only when he muses about her.
            In the first book, in the Lannisters' camp, when Tywin says that Joffrey is acting stupid by executing Ned Stark and retiring Barristan Selmy, Tyrion says that he also made some stupid things when he was approximately his age. Tywin says, that he should be glad therefore that Joffrey didn't yet marry a whore, thus referring to Tysha.
            On the night of Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he tells her briefly about his first marriage to Tysha, omitting what led to that marriage and what happened afterwards, only that was a very short marriage. He bitterly refers to Tysha as "Lady Tysha of House Silverfist. Their arms have one gold coin and a hundred silver, upon a bloody sheet".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tysha</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemTysha</string></dict>
        <key>Tansy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.45.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tansy was a servant of House Bolton and one of Ramsay Snow's bedwarmers.
            Due to Myranda's supposed jealousy of her, Tansy is hunted through the woods near the Dreadfort by Ramsay Snow, Myranda and the bastard's girls, with Reek feebly attempting to keep up. Ramsay and Myranda taunt her with mild amusement as she desperately runs to evade them, with Ramsay saying that if she makes it out of the woods, she "wins" -- presumably, Ramsay would stop chasing her and she'd be allowed to live. Myranda eventually strikes her in the leg with an arrow, and Tansy begs for her life as Ramsay says she has become a problem; Myranda is jealous of her presence, although Myranda denies it. Ramsay goads the dogs into ripping her to shreds as she screams. Myranda mockingly comments that she is "not so pretty now," while Theon watches with discomfort.[1]
            Myranda mentions Tansy to Sansa Stark as one of several women who Ramsay was involved with but killed after they began to bore him, and gleefully quips that Ramsay let her join him in "hunting" Tansy for fun, which angers Sansa.[2] Tansy is later partly avenged when Myranda is thrown to her death by Theon.[3]
            Though Ramsay vows to avenge her death, he orders Myranda's body to be unceremoniously fed to the dogs as Tansy was. As they flee from Winterfell on foot, Theon forces Sansa to accompany him through the freezing river to throw the hounds off scent, remembering what happened to Tansy.[4]
            Eventually, Tansy is completely avenged when Ramsay is also fed to his hounds but, unlike Myranda, he is fed to them alive as Tansy was.[5]
            George R.R. Martin stated on the DVD commentary of "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" that he had written a scene involving Myranda and Violet for the fourth season. Stephanie Blacker was not available for the fourth season due to pregnancy. Since Martin wrote "The Lion and the Rose", this seems to suggest that the role played by Tansy in the episode was originally intended for Violet, further evidenced by dialogue in the fifth season where Myranda mentions that Ramsay murdered Violet when she became pregnant (possibly with his child).
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no mention of a girl at the Dreadfort named Tansy. The name is apparently fairly common for girls born in the Riverlands, and is possibly meant to be a reference to an ingredient of Moon Tea, a powerful contraceptive/abortifacient, since smallfolk often name their daughters after flowers and herbs. There are two book characters by that name, neither has anything to do with the Boltons:
            Tansy's role in the show is filled in the books by Kyra, who was a bedwarmer for Theon Greyjoy after the seizure of Winterfell. When the Boltons put the castle to the sword, they chained the women and children and took them to the Dreadfort. Kyra is manipulated by Ramsay into releasing Reek from his cell, but he successfully tracks them both down as was his intention all along, and kills Kyra. At some point after the hunt, Ramsay names a puppy from the next litter of pack hounds Kyra, as he's known to do with his "sport".
            It is unknown if there was a girl named Tansy among Ramsay's victims. If there was, the fact that none of his dogs is named Tansy indicates that the hunt was not challenging enough in his eyes, and that girl was given a painful death.
            During the final stages of his illness, Hoster Tully continuously mutters the word "Tansy". Catelyn initially believes it to be a name and attempts to discover who it belongs to, but to no avail. After thinking it over, recalling Lysa's tearful reaction when Catelyn let her hold baby Robb, she realizes the terrible secret that haunts her father on his deathbed: Lysa got pregnant some time before her marriage to Jon Arryn, and their father forced her to undergo an abortion by drinking Moon tea (one of its ingredients is the herb called Tansy). The only detail that Catelyn does not figure is who was the man who got her sister pregnant. Lysa reveals that when she drags Sansa to the Moon Door: after Petyr Baelish was defeated by Brandon Stark when he challenged him for Catelyn's hand, Lysa nursed him and the two ended up sleeping together, with Lysa becoming pregnant as a result of this. After Hoster had to send Petyr back to the Fingers, Lysa revealed this to him in the hopes that he would relent and allow her to marry Petyr. Instead he made her abort the child, for which she resented him for the rest of both of their lives, hence she did not visit him when he was dying or attend his funeral.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tansy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemTansy</string></dict>
        <key>Tyene Sand</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.46.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tyene Sand was a bastard daughter of Prince Oberyn Martell and his paramour, Ellaria Sand, and one of the Sand Snakes. She takes part in the Coup in Dorne, during which she seizes power in Dorne from the legitimate House Martell along with her mother, Ellaria, and her half-sisters Obara Sand and Nymeria Sand, by murdering Myrcella Baratheon, Doran Martell and Trystane Martell. She is later poisoned by Cersei Lannister for her role in Myrcella's murder.
            Tyene Sand is the third of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the "Sand Snakes". She is also his eldest daughter by his paramour, Ellaria Sand. Tyene fights using a pair of long daggers, though her other signature weapon is her skill with poisons - a tactic she learned from her father. Like her father, she is known to coat her blades with poisons, making a single scratch lethal.[1]
            Tyene can feign being soft-spoken and childlike, but this is just an act to keep her enemies off guard, as she is just as fierce as her older sisters.[2]
            Tyene is the youngest of the four adult Sand Snakes, and more impetuous than her older sisters Obara and Nymeria. Where Obara will face threats head-on (confident in her martial prowess), and Nymeria will stand back and analyze the situation to make a precise strike at her enemy's weak points, Tyene tends to heedlessly charge ahead. This is exemplified by her choice of daggers as her main hand-held weapon: they are quick on the draw, allowing her to lash out quickly, before even her older sisters can restrain her.[3]
            Oberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to Queen Cersei Lannister.[4]
            When Ellaria Sand goes to the Water Gardens to scold Doran for his inaction to Oberyn's murder, she tells the Prince that Dorne must go to war against the Lannisters, and points out that the Sand Snakes, who have the love of their people, agree with her, and that they will avenge their father if Doran does not.[5]
            Tyene, Nymeria, and Obara meet with Ellaria, who embraces her daughter Tyene warmly. They discuss rallying Dorne to go to war against House Lannister. When the conversation shifts to Myrcella Baratheon, Obara reveals information she received from a merchant captain that Jaime Lannister has been smuggled into Dorne. Ellaria insists that they must stop Jaime from reaching Myrcella. They are presented with a choice: side with Doran and have peace, or side with Ellaria and have war. Tyene is the first to speak, saying she will always side with her mother, and then Nymeria and Obara also agree to side with Ellaria.[6]
            When the Sand Snakes make their attempt to kidnap Myrcella, Tyene battles Bronn with the help of her sister Nym while Obara goes after Jaime Lannister. Although she manages to wound Bronn in the arm with one of her daggers, the battle is quickly broken up by Areo Hotah and the rest of Doran's personal guard. After a tense confrontation, Obara commands her sisters to drop their weapons, and Tyene does so. They, along with Jaime, Bronn and Ellaria Sand, are taken into custody.[7]
            The Sand Snakes are imprisoned for their part in Myrcella's attempted kidnapping, with Bronn in the cell next to them. Tyene seduces Bronn from behind the bars of her cell, all while asking about the cut she inflicted on him during their earlier fight. Unknown to Bronn, Tyene coated her daggers with a poison called The Long Farewell, and her attempts to seduce him were in an effort to raise his heart rate, hastening the poison's course through his body. His vision blurs, his nose bleeds, and he collapses along a wall in his cell. Tyene removes an ampoule containing the antidote from her necklace and offers it to Bronn, but only if he tells her that she is the most beautiful woman in the world. Barely coherent, he replies that she is, and is thrown the ampoule. He manages to drink it before passing out.[8]
            As Tyene and Nymeria are playing a game of reflexes with each other, Areo Hotah arrives at their prison cell to escort the three Sand Snakes to the Water Gardens. Tyene is forced to watch along with the other Sand Snakes as Prince Doran forces Ellaria to swear her allegiance to him in the Water Gardens, bound at the wrist. [9]
            Tyene and her sisters later watch as Princess Myrcella departs for King's Landing along with Jaime, Bronn, and Prince Trystane. Tyene sexually jokes with Bronn and promises that they may see each other again. After Ellaria seals Myrcella's fate with a poison kiss, Tyene offers a cloth for her mother to wipe the blood from her nose, an effect from the poison coated on her lips, as they watch Myrcella's boat from afar. Though the young Lannister is killed, Ellaria survives, drinking up the antidote. [10]
            Tyene and Ellaria are with Doran when a maester appears to deliver a message, bearing news of Ellaria's murder of Myrcella. Before the prince has a chance to react Tyene stabs Areo Hotah in the spine, killing him immediately before Ellaria assassinates Doran. Tyene also kills Maester Caleotte by throwing her dagger into his back as he tries to flee, despite Caleotte possessing no threat whatsoever (it is possible that Tyene killed him just for fun), and watches with satisfaction as her uncle bleeds to death.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tyene_Sand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemTyeneSand</string></dict>
        <key>Talia Forrester</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.47.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Talia Forrester is the youngest daughter of Lord Gregor Forrester.
            Talia was the fifth born child of Lady Elissa Forrester and Lord Gregor Forrester. She has five other siblings: Ethan, her twin brother counterpart, Rodrik, Asher, Mira, and Ryon.
            Talia's father is killed during the Red Wedding by Frey Soldiers at the Twins, a fatal clash that only Gared Tuttle, squire to her father, survives. Upon arriving in Ironrath, Talia and her mother greet Gared, who brings the grisly news of the events of The Red Wedding and Lord Gregor's sword. Talia shows concern for Gared's own losses. Sometime later, Talia plays with Ryon and Ethan in the ironwood outside the fort, contemplating Ethan's new duties as the Lord of Ironrath. Depending on what choice the player makes, Talia will begin to show increasing concern for her twin brother's safety and morality. Ethan manages to save Talia from the grasps of Ramsay Snow after he arrives to negotiate over the ironwood for House Bolton, but is killed as a result. Talia is deeply affected by her brother's untimely death.
            Talia is first seen singing and practicing for the funeral of her brother and father while Rodrik sleeps. When Rodrik wakes up after, Talia tells Rodrik Ethan is dead and that she misses him. She then asks Rodrik about his leg and if he will be able to walk again. Rodrik then tries to but falls to the ground. The player can then choose to accept Talia's help or to try and walk on their own. Both eventually head outside where some of the Whitehall men make fun of Rodrik. During the funeral for Gregor and Ethan, Talia sings a passionate ballad concerning their deaths and how House Forrester will continue to fight on.
            As Rodrik wakes up, following a dream of battle, Talia rushes into his room saying the Whitehills are assembling in the courtyard and that he has to do something. As Rodrik prepares, Talia says she will check on their mother.
            Talia is waiting for Rodrik alongside Elissa, Royland, Duncan and Ortengryn. As Rodrik tries to get to the bottom of the situation Harys, a Whitehill soldier, burns a cart to catch their attention as Gryff Whitehill makes himself known. Talia watches on in concern as her brother and Gryff butt heads and Gryff's men head into the Great Hall, claiming it for their own.
            A few days later, Talia catches a Whitehill soldier stealing from the Forresters' kitchen. She tells him to stop, but he lays his hands on her and she defends herself by biting him. The soldier reports her to Gryff, who drags her out into the courtyard to punish her in front of Rodrik. Rodrik can either say she defended herself or made a mistake, but Talia stands up for herself either way.
            Talia stands up to Gryff, enraging him, but Duncan stops Talia from being hurt by intervening and pleading that Gryff forgives her. He claims that no one questions Gryff and that Talia's outburst was merely due to the passions of youth. Gryff is pleased with this and says he likes Duncan, claiming that the castellan is his man and loyal dog. He shoves Duncan to one side and Rodrik can either punch Gryff or defend Duncan's honor.
            Royland commends Talia's bravery when she stands up to Gryff, saying she is smart, wise, and knows how to tell it like it is. Gryff becomes enraged and says that she should know her station, grabbing Talia's arm and throwing her into the mud. Rodrik then has the option to punch Gryff or help Talia. If Talia is helped, she thanks Rodrik and watches from the sidelines.
            Gryff knocks Rodrik to the ground in an attempt to teach him when to know he is beaten. While Rodrik is down on the ground, Talia begs Rodrik to get up and not give Gryff the satisfaction of beating him. Gryff gloats, knowing Rodrik is at his mercy, and speaks of Ethan. He says how Ramsay Snow taught Ethan a lesson, and that he may have to teach Talia unless Rodrik stays down.
            Regardless of whether Rodrik keeps getting up or stays down, he takes the punishment in Talia's place, sparing her from Gryff's wrath. If Rodrik stays down Talia believes that he let Gryff win.
            Rodrik and Talia meet later, overlooking the courtyard. Talia remarks that Gryff is strolling around like he owns the place, but he's let his guard down. She asks whether Gryff got what he wanted, or Rodrik did.
            She admits that she told Ethan not to change, but is now aware that it was foolish of her. She tells Rodrik that she is ready to change, and is prepared to do anything for House Forrester. Gregor Forrester used to say that the Forresters are as tough as the Ironwood - all of them.
            Rodrik can say a time might come where Talia's help is needed, but it is not right now. He says he is unsure of what the future may bring, but the Forresters will stand tall.
            Talia is first seen watching Royland and Rodrik practicing their sword technique. She observes Royland teaching Rodrik a move which should bring Gryff down to his level during their next encounter. Duncan arrives with Elaena and Arthur Glenmore, prompting Talia to greet them both and then depart.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Talia_Forrester</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemTaliaForrester</string></dict>
        <key>Talla Tarly</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.48.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lady Talla Tarly is the only daughter of late Lord Randyll Tarly of Horn Hill and the middle child between Samwell and Dickon Tarly.
            Talla was born at Horn Hill to Randyll and Melessa Tarly. She is the sister of Samwell and Dickon Tarly.
            Talla's brother Samwell Tarly is en route to the Citadel to study about the White Walkers. Since the Citadel does not accept women and children, he plans to send Gilly and her baby Sam to live with his family at Horn Hill. While he does not get on with his father Randyll, he gets on with Talla and their mother Melessa.[1]
            Talla eagerly greets Sam as he arrives with Gilly and her baby, complaining about her arranged marriage to the old, yellow-toothed Symun Fossoway. Talla takes Gilly under her wing and starts musing on what color she would look best in. She also offers to put Gilly up in one of her bedrooms.
            At dinner, Talla makes small talk with Gilly, and is impressed that Gilly can hunt for herself, as Randyll never saw the need for her to learn. She later sits uncomfortably as Randyll insults Sam repeatedly. When Randyll realizes that Gilly is a wildling, Melessa listens to his rant before giving him a piece of her mind, then storming out with Gilly and Talla in tow.[2]
            With the deaths of her father Randyll and brother Dickon in the aftermath of the Battle of the Goldroad, and with Samwell unable to inherit as both a man of the Night's Watch and a Maester-in-training, Talla Tarly becomes the Lady of Horn Hill and head of House Tarly.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Talla has been briefly mentioned as Sam's sister but otherwise not described in detail and has not yet appeared.
            Randyll Tarly has five children: his eldest child Samwell, then three daughters, and finally his second son Dickon Tarly. After he became dissatisfied with the bookish Samwell as a child he kept having more children with his wife until they produced another son to replace him. Talla is the eldest of Samwell's three sisters (the other two haven't been named).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Talla_Tarly</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemTallaTarly</string></dict>
        <key>Tanda Stokeworth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.49.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tanda Stokeworth is the lady of Castle Stokeworth.
            Bronn mistakenly believes that he and his betrothed Lollys will one day reside at Castle Stokeworth. Lollys corrects him by saying that when her mother dies her older sister Falyse will inherit the castle. She also tells him that Falyse pulls her hair when their mother is not looking.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tanda Stokeworth is the Lady of Stokeworth. She is very old, and known to not be a very bright or attractive woman.
            Tanda is the head of House Stokeworth in the novels. When House Stokeworth was first mentioned in the TV series in Season 4's "Mockingbird", a point of some confusion was that Tyrion said that Lollys's older sister would inherit Castle Stokeworth after their father died. When Lollys first appeared on-screen in Season 5, however, she made it clear that her older sister will inherit the castle after their mother dies. It is possible that the TV writers thought that having a female head of a major House would be confusing and require some sort of lengthy explanation, so they simply pushed back the explanation about Lollys's mother being the actual head of the House to Season 5. It can easily be explained that Tyrion was simply mistaken or misspoke.
            During the reign of Aerys II, Manly Stokeworth was Commander of the City Watch. He was succeeded in the position by Janos Slynt. Littlefinger remarked that the widowed Lady Tanda has no love for the Lannisters: it is quite possible that Manly was in fact her husband, and that he died during the Sack of King's Landing committed by Tywin Lannister's army.
            Unable to find a husband for her daughter Lollys, she made several attempts to convince Lord Petyr Baelish to marry Lollys by serving him extravagant meals. Littlefinger had no intention of marrying Lollys, finding her to be bad company as well as overweight and unattractive. She later makes similar attempts with Tyrion Lannister, with him repeatedly trying to avoid the invitations.
            Once the War of the Five Kings breaks out, Tanda and Lord Gyles Rosby provide half of the food still in arriving King's Landing as their lands lie close to the city to the north and are still untouched by war.
            Along with her daughters, Tanda attends several significant events in King's Landing such as King Joffrey Baratheon's nameday celebration, Princess Myrcella Baratheon's departure for Dorne (after which the Riot of King's Landing takes place, in which Lollys is gang raped and impregnated) and the Purple Wedding. During the Battle of the Blackwater, they take shelter with the other women in Maegor's Holdfast.
            After the death of Tywin Lannister, Tanda suggests naming Lollys's child after him, as she claims to have admired him above all other men. Cersei Lannister is disgusted by the notion that he father's name would be given to a bastard born of rape. This subplot was omitted from the TV series, in which Lollys was never raped.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tanda_Stokeworth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemTandaStokeworth</string></dict>
        <key>Selyse Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.50.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Selyse Baratheon, née Florent, was the wife of Stannis Baratheon, the Lord of Dragonstone and claimant to the Iron Throne. She was born into House Florent of Brightwater Keep, a noble house of the Reach and bannermen of House Tyrell.[1]
            Selyse and Stannis have only one living child, a sickly but intelligent daughter, Princess Shireen Baratheon. The rest of Selyse and Stannis's offspring, Petyr, Tommard, and Edric, were all stillborn. She keeps their corpses floating in crystal containers filled with chemicals in her chambers.
            Queen Selyse is present at the ritual burning of the statues of the Seven on the shores of Dragonstone, standing at the side of her husband, the King. When Stannis pulls the flaming Lightbringer from one of the statues, she kneels alongside the other worshippers of the Lord of Light. After the ceremony is over, Stannis extends his hand to her and Selyse rises to her feet to walk after him.[2]
            Melisandre notes that Selyse has failed to give Stannis a son, but only stillborn boys, and that Selyse is sickly and often confined to her tower at Dragonstone.[3]
            Stannis later reminds Ser Davos Seaworth how his wife Selyse nearly died during the siege of Storm's End during Robert's Rebellion before Davos was able to breach the lines and bring in supplies.[4]
            Depressed following his defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, Stannis visits Selyse for the first time since returning from the battle. He finds her in her chamber, praying over a fire to the Lord of Light: Selyse is a fanatical believer in the religion of R'hllor and was who first invited Melisandre to Dragonstone. Stannis and Selyse do not have a loving relationship, but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the Lord's Chosen. She tells him not to despair despite his defeat, and he will be victorious, but he laments that he used to believe that once. Due to his extreme belief in duty, (unlike his hedonistic brother Robert) Stannis is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to Selyse, when he had sex with Melisandre to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed Renly. He begins to confess to Selyse that he has sinned and shamed her, but she interrupts him and says Melisandre already told her everything - and that no act done in service of the Lord of Light can be a sin. Indeed, she wept for joy when Melisandre told her of this service she did for the Lord of Light with Stannis, and because the Red Priestess gave him a "son" (of sorts) which she never could. Stannis' face is filled with a mix of shock, disgust, and relief. Selyse had three sons with Stannis but they were all stillborn, and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars. The deaths of her "sweet boys" and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected Selyse, and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the Lord of Light. She weeps, and laments that she has given Stannis nothing - he does not blame her, and with pity he says that's not true. Selyse understands he is referring to their daughter and only child, Princess Shireen Baratheon. She grows annoyed when she realizes he's come to see her too, and says he shouldn't waste time on such distractions, but insists that she is his daughter, and she relents because it is not her place to question her king.[5]
            On the beach of Dragonstone, Melisandre presides over a public burning, setting ablaze three people chained to stakes as an offering to the Lord of Light. One of the victims is Queen Selyse Baratheon's own brother, condemned for his lack of faith in the Lord's power. Melisandre is surprisingly silent throughout the proceedings; it is Selyse who takes the greatest pleasure in the ritual. Afterwards, Stannis and Selyse eat dinner, with Melisandre as a guest at their table. The royal couple argue over their daughter, Princess Shireen Baratheon; Selyse believes the girl's disfigurement is a punishment from the Lord of Light, but Stannis angrily forbids his wife from physically chastising their daughter for her perceived faults. Selyse switches tactics and suggests that Melisandre speak to Shireen.[6]
            Queen Selyse speaks to Melisandre, who is enjoying a bath. She quips that the Lord of Light told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath, but the joke goes over Selyse's head. To cement Selyse's position as Melisandre's most devoted follower, the Red Priestess tells her about using potions and illusions in serving the Lord of Light and that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on. Selyse asks her if she used the potions when she slept with Stannis, to which she replies that she did not. Selyse then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter Shireen behind when they go to the North but Melisandre is as dismissive about Shireen's "heresy" as she always is, and assures Selyse that Shireen will be needed where they are going.[7]
            Selyse accompanies Stannis to the North in his defense of the Night's Watch against the wildlings. She is present at the Watch's funeral for their fallen brothers.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Selyse_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemSelyseBaratheon</string></dict>
        <key>Sera Durwell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.51.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sera Durwell, actually Sera Flowers is a handmaiden in service of Margaery Tyrell.
            "Flowers" is the special surname used for acknowledged bastards in the Reach (just as "Snow" is the special bastard surname in the North). However, Sera was renamed by the Tyrells to hide the fact that she was a bastard.
            Sera is the bastard child of a handmaiden of Olenna Tyrell whose family are distant relatives to House Tyrell. She doesn't know who her father is, as her mother died when she was very young. Despite being a bastard and the fact her mother's family are ashamed of her, she managed to become a handmaiden to Margaery Tyrell. Sera is embarrassed about being a bastard so she seeks to keep it a secret from anyone whom she doesn't trust and hopes to marry into a noble family. In order to help keep her secret, she claims that she is from House Durwell, a house that died out two centuries ago, with the support from the Tyrells. She followed Lady Margaery from Highgarden to King's Landing.
            Sera is shown to be good friends with the fellow handmaiden of Lady Margery, Mira Forrester, and is on good terms with Lady Margaery. She is present when Margaery notifies Mira of Cersei's suspicion towards her and her house, and announces to the Throne Room Mira and Margaery's arrival.
            Afterwards, Sera asks Mira how it went, before the two joke about the various men present at court. Sera states that she wouldn't mind marrying Joffrey if it would mean she could be queen. Depending on the player's choice, Mira can either appease Margaery for assistance for her house with or without Sera in presence. Later on if Sera is allowed to stay and listen to Mira's proposal she is sympathetic and asks if she can help, if she is told to leave she is upset and questions her friendship with Mira.
            While Mira is writing letters for the royal wedding when Sera enters the room and asks to speak with Mira.
            Later Mira and Sera walk in the gardens around King's Landing, and Sera leads Mira to a seating area, where she reveals she has a cask of Arbor red wine from Cersei's favorite stock. Mira has the choice whether to drink some of the wine or not. Sera reveals to Mira she is in fact a bastard, and her true name is actually Sera Flowers. During their talk they are interrupted by Tyrion Lannister, who questions them about the source of the wine, knowing how expensive an Arbor red is and Cersei certainly did not give it to them. He warns the handmaidens that if Cersei found that they had the wine she would drown them in it, and directs his attention to Mira, discussing ironwood dealings. Mira leaves with Tyrion, leaving Sera to drink the wine.
            Sera is seen walking with Mira in the gardens speaking of her excitement of the wedding as it will be a good chance for her to find a husband. While they're walking they see Lord Morgryn speaking to a man called Garibald Tarwick, Sera asks Mira to cover for her while she goes to speak to him, after she finishes she notices Mira talking to Tom ask thinks that they were romantically involved much to Mira's surprise, they then start walking to the throne room while Sera starts telling Mira about Garibald.
            When Sera and Mira arrive in the throne room they see Margeary talking to Cersei Lannister about last minute details regarding the wedding, including that Margeary's handmaidens are not going to be able to attend the feast much to Sera's horror, when Cersei tells Margeary that Mira and Tyrion have been speaking to each other Margeary is greatly annoyed by this and gets Sera to help her prepare for the wedding instead of Mira.
            At the wedding Sera tells Mira that Margaery is furious and is considering having Mira replaced, Sera offers to help Mira and if Mira accepts then Sera promises to do what she can.
            Sera makes her first appearance of the episode when Mira attempts to sneak into Tommen's Coronation Feast. Sera, who is walking with Lord Tarwick, is shocked to be approached by Mira since she was not invited. Excusing herself from Tarwick, Sera listens as Mira asks for Sera's help sneaking into the Feast. Sera is initially not willing to put her relationship with Margaery on the line and warns Mira that Margaery is still angry with her, but soon relents.
            Sera nods to the guard, explaining that Mira is with her. The two girls are let in. After a brief conversation between her, Mira, and Tarwick, Sera and Tarwick will continue their conversation on a bench. When Margaery makes her way to the Feast, Sera saves Mira just in time from being noticed by greeting Margaery. The two of them can be overheard talking about Mira, where Sera attempts to get Margaery to forgive Mira. Margaery asks Sera to consider why she should put in so much effort for Mira, when Mira potentially would not do as much for her. Sera says nothing, looking down thoughtfully.
            Lord Tarwick will later approach Mira, suspicious of Sera's last name, Durwell, because House Durwell went extinct 200 years prior. Mira can either lie for Sera, vouching for her family's authenticity, or reveal the truth about her background. If Mira is to lie, Tarwick will officially court Sera, and begin to make marriage preparations. If the truth is revealed, Tarwick will cancel any plans of marrying Sera.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sera_Flowers</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemSeraDurwell</string></dict>

        <key>Sylvi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.54.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sylvi is a wildling living north of the Wall. She is Cotter's younger sister.
            Sylvi is a wildling who grew up with her brother Cotter in a village near Hardhome. She was born with white hair, and was seen as a bad omen by the other villagers, who stayed away from her and had hoped that she would've died before her second name day. Because of her white hair, her mother gave her the nickname "Little Moon". After her second name day and Sylvi was given her name, the villagers threatened Sylvi's mother to leave the village. Instead, from what Cotter said in "A Nest of Vipers", it is assumed that Sylvi's mother wrapped her in furs and left her in the forest to die. After Cotter had seen this, he went out and recovered Sylvi, and left the village and their mother.
            After a few years, Cotter was separated from Sylvi, and was forced to join the Night's Watch, leaving Sylvi to fend for herself in the wild for several months. Sylvi eventually settles in an abandoned hunting camp, where she keeps her possessions such as a talisman with a bear on it. It is assumed that the bear talisman was given to her by her mother, and she marks the trees with the symbol in hopes that Cotter will find her. At some point, she also came in contact with several female wildling hunters, who appear in "Sons of Winter". Sylvi is proficient with a spear, knows how to hunt, and survive in the wild.
            When Gared Tuttle, Cotter, optionally Finn rest at an seemingly abandoned wildling camp after their encounter with a group of female wildings, Gared searches the camp's hut, where Sylvi holds him at spear point. Cotter emerges, and he and Sylvi hug. He introduces them to the Sylvi, stating that she can take them to the North Grove.
            After seeing that Cotter has been treated for an injury or the actual injury on his arm, Sylvi begins questioning Gared on how Cotter got the injury. Regardless of what he says, Sylvi disapproves of Gared, saying that he didn't belong North of the Wall, and that she and her brother don't need to die for him trying to look for the North Grove. Sylvi adamantly decides that she and her brother are going to head South, to join Mance Rayder and then goes off to hunt for food.
            After Gared leaves the camp, he interrupts Sylvi while she is hunting, accidentally scaring away a rabbit that she barely misses with her spear. After they talk a little bit, they continue hunting. After they've finished hunting, Sylvi asks Gared if he's ever lost somebody he's cared about, and tells him that she won't risk losing her brother again, not even for the North Grove. Gared is interested about what she has to say about the North Grove, and Sylvi tells him that a few years ago one of the Ice-River Clans set out to find it. She tells him that they had heard North Grove isn't touched by the cold, even during the Winter, and that the Ice-River Clan never returned.
            They then hear Cotter yell out for Gared, and they run back to find the Wights of the female hunters encountered last episode attacking the camp. Sylvi says that she knew them, then helps Gared and Cotter fight the Wights. During the fight, Sylvi tells Gared that fire is the only way to kill a Wight. After the fight, they see that more Wights are coming, and the trio flees North, hoping they can find refuge in the North Grove.
            While Gared is searching for the North Grove, Sylvi will ask her if he found it. When Gared is able to find it, they get attacked by a bear. Gared is able to fend it off and they are able to reach the Grove. Sylvi is then tied up while Elsera Snow offers to help Cotter. While tied up she informs Gared that the free folk of the North Grove are not normal and the place has an evil vibe. The North Grove is then attacked by Wights but Gared, Elsera and Josera Snow are able to defeat them. They return to find that Sylvi has escaped but she is soon caught by Elsera's wildlings. Sylvi meets her brother and after seeing that he is suffering, asks Gared to put him out of misery. To carry out the task, she hands him nightshade. Gared can choose to kill Cotter using nightshade or rip his heart out and use it to harness the power of the Grove as requested by Elsera. If he does the latter, Sylvi will be angry at him during Cotter's funeral. If Gared chooses to stay in the North Grove, then during the ending of the episode she is seen preparing to defend the Grove against Wights.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sylvi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemSylvi</string></dict>

        <key>Sally</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.56.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sally​ was the daughter of a farmer.
            She lives near Fairmarket with her father. Her mother died some time ago. She also has an uncle in the North. According to her father, she makes an excellent rabbit stew.
            Sally and her father find Sandor Clegane and Arya Stark on their land, and give them shelter when Arya tells them that they fought for House Tully. The farmer offers Sandor fair pay to assist with farmwork and drive off raiders. Sandor agrees to this, however the next day he overpowers the farmer and steals his silver. Arya criticizes Sandor for this, but Sandor replies that the farmer is weak and that he and Sally will both be dead when winter comes.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character parallel to Sally. Arya and the Hound do not take shelter with any peasant on their way to the Vale of Arryn.
            In the book, while Arya and the Hound are on their way to the Vale, they come to a small village in the foothall of the Mountains of the Moon. The Hound decides to stay there for a while. The villagers need help to build a wooden palisade around their homes, and they offer the Hound and Arya food and shelter and money for work. The Hound agrees, on condition that he gets wine as well. They stay in the village for several weeks. The Hound works at day, and drinks himself to sleep each night.
            Arya finds the village quiet and boring. The villagers think she is the Hound's daughter, and she is too tired to correct them. She stays distant from the villagers. The village elder's daughter follows Arya everywhere, much to Arya's annoyance, though she keeps telling the girl to leave her alone. Finally Arya takes the girl's doll and tears it apart, then the girl stops pestering her. Sally is perhaps loosely based on that girl.
            When the work is done, the village elder tells them they must leave, because the villagers do not have enough food for strangers when winter comes, and a man like the Hound brings blood. The Hound accepts that without taking any violent action against the villagers. As a payment he receives a pouch full of coppers, a skin of sour ale and a new sword, then he and Arya leave.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sally</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemSally</string></dict>
        <key>Sarella Sand</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.57.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sarella Sand is a bastard daughter of Prince Oberyn Martell and is a member of the Sand Snakes.
            Sarella Sand is the fourth of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the "Sand Snakes".
            Oberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to Queen Cersei Lannister.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Sarella is Oberyn's daughter whom he fathered on a ship captain from the Summer Islands. Her mother is the captain of the Feathered Kiss.
            Sarella has her mother's looks of dark brown skin, curly black hair, and black eyes, though like all the Sand Snakes she has her father's widow's peak and the same shape to her eyes.
            She is nearly twenty years old, and has a reputation for insatiable curiosity and "pushing in where she didn’t belong". While Obara and Nymeria inherited their father's martial prowess, and Tyene his skill with poisons, Sarella inherited Oberyn's keen intellect.
            Sarella has not appeared yet on the novels or the released sample chapters, only mentioned. After Prince Doran hears what Obara, Nymeria and Tyene have in mind to avenge their father, he says that he hopes Sarella shows more common sense than her sisters. Currently she is outside of Dorne (it is not revealed where exactly), hence she is the only of the Sand Snakes who is not arrested, nor does she take any part in the missions that Doran assigns her elder sisters and Arianne to.
            In the fourth novel, Sam Tarly meets at the Citadel a novice who introduces himself as Alleras aka the Sphinx, claiming that his father is Dornish and his mother is a Summer Islander trader. There is a fan theory that Alleras is in fact Sarella in disguise, since his name is Sarella spelled backwards, and based on what he tells about himself. If the theory is correct, it is unknown why Sarella is in Oldtown - whether she intends to become a maester (which is plausible in view of her thirst for knowledge), or is disguised as a part of a plan she has in store for settling score with the Lannisters.
            Sarella hasn't been identified by name in the TV series, though Oberyn did mention that he had eight daughters, just as in the novels, which indicates that she probably also "exists" in the TV continuity, even if she has not yet been featured.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sarella_Sand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemSarellaSand</string></dict>
        <key>Roslin Tully</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.58.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Roslin Tully, née Frey, is the daughter of Lord Walder Frey and is married to Lord Edmure Tully at the Red Wedding.
            Roslin is the 19-year-old daughter of Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing. Unlike the majority of Lord Walder's brood, Roslin is quite beautiful. She was intended to marry King Robb Stark as part of an alliance between her father and him (Walder had given Robb a choice of any one of his many daughters or granddaughters, but Roslin would have been the obvious choice),[2] but Robb fell in love with and married Talisa Maegyr instead.[3]
            Lothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers arrive at Riverrun after Robb Stark offers to renew their alliance, but Black Walder relays that Lord Walder insists that Edmure Tully must immediately marry Roslin, having "gone off" long engagements after Robb reneged on his engagement. Edmure initially refuses, but eventually consents after bowing to family pressure as well as his desire to make amends for his blunder at the Battle of Stone Mill.[4]
            Edmure does not meet Roslin until she is unveiled at the wedding. Having seen Walder's other daughters, Edmure was shocked and relieved to see Roslin at last. The newlyweds got along quite well until Robb and Walder called for the bedding ceremony, when Roslin was carried off by Frey and Tully attendants to the bridal chamber.[5] It is not known what, if any, involvement Roslin had in the planning or execution of the grislier parts of her wedding. During their wedding night, Edmure impregnates Roslin, and she later gives birth to a son - although Edmure remains a captive at the Twins.
            During a conversation between Jaime Lannister and Roslin's captive husband, Edmure, Jaime points out that Roslin has already given Edmure a son that was sired on their wedding night. Edmure then reveals that he hasn't seen Roslin since their wedding night and has never met his son. [6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Roslin is born from Lord Walder's sixth wife, Bethany Rosby. Roslin is the fifth child that Bethany bore Walder, and she has four older brothers: Perwyn, Benfrey, Willamen, and Olyvar. Members of House Rosby are known to have frail health to begin with, and Bethany's frequent pregnancies took a heavy toll on her body. Walder kept Bethany almost constantly pregnant, having a new child every year of their marriage, and ultimately Roslin's mother died not long after she was born.
            Roslin is described as being the prettiest of Walder Frey's offspring. She is small with very white skin, a pretty face with a small chin, delicate nose, and big brown eyes. Between her teeth she has a small gap. Her hair is brown and reaches her waist. She has a gentle nature and a talent for music. Roslin was seventeen years old in the third novel, but in the corresponding section of Season 3 in the episode "The Climb", she is stated to be nineteen years old: this is in keeping with how most of the younger cast members have been aged-up by two years in the TV continuity.
            Unlike in the TV series, Roslin is introduced to Edmure shortly after he and the Starks arrive at the Twins. Since she is so small and has narrow hips, Edmure and Catelyn are concerned about her fertility. Catelyn discusses it with Maester Brenett, and he assures her there is nothing to worry about, for Roslin's mother gave Lord Walder a child every year, five of them have lived past infancy.
            Edmure finds it strange that Roslin is sobbing when she meets him. She tells him "I weep for joy, my lord". Only a moment before the massacre begins, Catelyn realizes the real reason for her tears: Roslin knew about the scheme and was forced to go along.
            By the point the books reached, Roslin is pregnant, and has not yet given birth. According to Perwyn, Roslin has been praying that her child will be a girl, fearing (correctly) that if she gives birth to a boy - her father will have no more need of her husband.
            Edmure knows about his wife's pregnancy, but unaware that if the child will be a boy, the Freys will dispose of him. Jaime promises Edmure, among his other terms of surrender, that he will send Roslin to join him in Casterly Rock; if her child is a boy, he will serve House Lannister as a page and a squire, and when he earns his knighthood they'll bestow some lands upon him; if Roslin gives birth to a daughter, Jaime will see her well dowered when she’s old enough to wed.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Roslin_Tully</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemRoslinTully</string></dict>
        <key>Ros</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.59.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ros was a prostitute of renowned beauty, and an acquaintance of Robb Stark, Theon Greyjoy and Jon Snow.
            Ros is a prostitute in the brothel in Winterfell's outlying town. She has drawn the attention of the young nobles of Winterfell including Theon Greyjoy and Jon Snow. Theon is a regular customer while Jon is not. Jon once paid Ros for her time but did not have sex with her because of a pang of conscience over the possibility of fathering a bastard when he has suffered the life of being a bastard himself.
            Ros says that she grew up in the town outside the walls of Winterfell, and remembers the day Sansa Stark was born and all the bells of the castle were rung in celebration.[1] Uncommon for most prostitutes, Ros is literate.[2]
            Ros is shown entertaining Tyrion Lannister shortly after his arrival at Winterfell. She informs Tyrion that the whorehouse was especially alerted to his imminent arrival, though by whom is not revealed.[3]
            When Tyrion is returning from the Wall, he stops at Winterfell. Believing the Lannisters are responsible for Bran's fall, Robb denies him Winterfell's hospitality. When Tyrion is leaving to go stay in the brothel, Theon Greyjoy recommends Ros to Tyrion, unaware that Tyrion is already acquainted with her. Tyrion promises "not to wear her out". At Castle Black, Jon Snow and his friend Samwell Tarly talk about having never been with a woman. Jon says that he once had the opportunity to have sex with Ros. He describes her to Sam with red hair and indescribably perfect breasts. Jon ultimately declined to have sex with Ros fearing if he fathered bastard children of his own, as a bastard himself he would have nothing to offer them.[4]
            Theon sneaks Ros into his chambers, where they both undress and have sex. He notices that she is wearing a Lannister lion pendant and she tells him that it was a gift from Tyrion. He becomes angry when she insinuates that Tyrion is a superior lover and that his family's honor is suspect due to the failed Greyjoy Rebellion. When he refuses to pay for the encounter, Ros suggests that he gets a wife instead, infuriating Theon further.[5]
            Theon is surprised to see Ros sitting in the back of a turnip cart. She tells him she has decided to leave Winter town to seek out employment in King's Landing, and is planning to board a boat out of White Harbor.
            He unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay, but she points out that, with war coming, all the men will be marching away and there is nothing for her here, while sarcastically asking Theon if he would be willing to marry her and make her Lady of the Iron Islands if she stayed. Though Theon denies it, his face implies that he has grown to love her. Theon throws her a coin, and she laughs and lifts up her skirt one last time. Theon reluctantly says he'll miss her, and she agrees that he will.[6]
            Arriving in King's Landing, Ros finds employment at a brothel owned by Littlefinger. He tutors her and another prostitute, Armeca, in the art of seduction. Ros learns that Littlefinger is infatuated with a woman who was betrothed to a man who injured him in a duel, but she later married the man's brother. However, it does not appear that she recognizes the woman in the story as Lady Catelyn Stark.[7]
            Ros's services are employed by Grand Maester Pycelle in King's Landing. As she gathers her clothes to leave, Pycelle begins to tell her about all the kings he has served, eventually his ramblings fade and she becomes impatient, questioning him about the original point of his speech. She leaves, frustrated.[8]
            Ros watches two new prostitutes in Petyr Baelish's brothel practicing their work. She repeats Petyr’s advice to ease into the act slowly and with passion. She tells the new employees to wash and dress for work that night before walking away. She is followed by Daisy, who she instructs in the merits of their upmarket brothel. She greets Lord Orson who is passing with a young man as she tells Daisy that they cater to a higher class of customer than she was used to in Haystack Hall. Daisy watches Armeca leading a client away. Ros notes that Armeca pretends not to speak the Common tongue in order to seem exotic and reveals that she actually grew up in Flea Bottom. Daisy says that Armeca is beautiful, but Ros is dismissive of her colleague.[9]
            Lord Commander Janos Slynt enters with several of his men. Ros greets him with familiarity. More goldcloaks enter with a bloodied prisoner and Janos snaps his fingers at his men who begin to search the brothel. Ros reminds him that Petyr is the establishment’s owner and Janos cites orders.
            Ros wonders who the orders came from and Janos tells her only that they are from someone who doesn’t care what Petyr thinks. Mhaegen is dragged into the room, holding her baby Barra (one of Robert’s bastards). Janos looks at his prisoner who nods recognition. Janos then signals one of his men who takes the baby from the sobbing Mhaegen, draws his knife and then hesitates. Janos tells his man to kill the baby and then does it himself when his subordinate cannot, horrifying both Ros and Mhaegen.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ros</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemRos</string></dict>

            Davos Seaworth reads a letter sent to Stannis Baratheon with an invitation to Rylene Florent's nameday.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Rylene Florent is not Shireen Baratheon's cousin, but Shireen's mother Selyse Baratheon's paternal aunt, which makes her Shireen's great aunt, as well as the aunt of Imry Florent and Melessa Tarly. Davos describes her as Shireen's "cousin" in the Season 3 finale, but he may have just been speaking loosely. Rylene Florent is married to Ser Rycherd Crane.

            Obella Sand is the sixth of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the "Sand Snakes". Her mother is Oberyn's paramour, Ellaria Sand.
            Oberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to Queen Cersei Lannister.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Obella's story is the same. She is twelve years old.
            After prince Doran hears the plans that the three elder Sand Snakes have in mind to avenge their father, he orders to arrest them lest they ignite a war with the Lannisters, and their younger sisters too (except Sarella), fearing that the young Sand Snakes may be used by others in plots against him. Obella is sent to the Water Gardens alongside her mother and her three sisters. Following the arrival of Ser Balon Swann, Doran releases Obella, her mother and sisters.
            In Arianne's first sample chapter from the sixth novel, it is mentioned Obella is to be dispatched to Sunspear, to serve as a cupbearer to the wife of the castellan, Manfrey Martell.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Obella_Sand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemObellaSand</string></dict>
        <key>Obara Sand</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.62.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Obara Sand was the eldest child of Prince Oberyn Martell, one of the Sand Snakes, and a formidable warrior. Along with Ellaria Sand, the paramour of her father, and her half-sisters Nymeria Sand and Tyene Sand, she takes part in the Coup in Dorne, during which they seize power in Dorne from the legitimate House Martell. She is killed by Euron Greyjoy when he ambushes the Iron Fleet on its way to Sunspear.
            Obara Sand is the eldest of the "Sand Snakes", the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, and was named in honor of her father. Her mother was a peasant from Oldtown.
            Even more than her sisters, Obara inherited her father's martial prowess, particularly his skill with a spear. She is a very tough warrior and the most overtly martial of the Sand Snakes. The other Sand Snakes will change out of their light leather armor when traveling in the hot deserts of Dorne, but Obara always wears her leather armor. She also tends to dress in a more masculine style than her sisters, even when not in combat; her robes greatly resemble the ones her father wore. When she sees an obstacle, she does not attempt to undermine it with deception or intrigue, but will attack it head-on, relying on her skill and the strength of her weapons. This is in contrast with her sister Nymeria, who prefers to hold off and analyze her foes to calculate a more efficient means of defeating them. [1]
            Obara is the Sand Snake most like their father. He taught her the ways of war himself, training her in the use of a traditional Dornish spear like he used. Unlike most Dornishmen, who are overtly passionate, Obara is staunchly disciplined to not overtly display her emotions. This is largely due to her origins: unlike her sisters Nymeria and Tyene, Obara's mother was not a noblewoman, so when Oberyn came to take her to court, she had to choose between staying or going, the latter meaning she would never see her mother again. As a result, she has a cold and hardened demeanor, and cares very little for her family.[2] This is not to say that Obara is the most rational of the sisters (Nymeria is the most rational and calculating one). She is actually quite irrational and ruled by her emotions, she just doesn't outwardly show them that much. The difference is that in a situation where Tyene would aggressively shout insults at an enemy and attack them, Obara would just silently walk straight up to them and stab them without saying a word. Nymeria, in contrast, would hold back and attempt to assess if there would be a more opportune moment to strike at a later time. [3]
            Obara is loosely the lead Sand Snake, because she is eldest and probably the best fighter. Her sister Nymeria does nothing without her approval. Her father Oberyn and Nymeria were the only two people that Obara ever fully trusted. As her close confident, Nymeria is also the only person who can say "no" to Obara: while they may seem to argue at times, conversely this is because Nymeria is the only person that Obara will at least pay heed to - for anyone else, arguing with Obara is useless once she has her mind set on something. Nymeria is the only person Obara will ever take advice from (after their father's death).[4]
            Oberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to Queen Cersei Lannister while the two discuss Cersei's own illegitimate daughter Myrcella Baratheon, who has been sent to Dorne. [5]
            When Ellaria Sand goes to the Water Gardens to scold Doran for his inaction to Oberyn's murder, she tells the Prince that Dorne must go to war against the Lannisters, and points out that the Sand Snakes, who have the love of their people, agree with her, and that they will avenge their father if Doran does not. [6]
            Ellaria later meets with Obara and Obara's two younger half-sisters, Nymeria and Tyene. Obara reveals that she captured the merchant captain who smuggled Jaime Lannister and Bronn into Dorne, and the Sand Snakes and Ellaria deduce Jaime is coming for Myrcella, robbing them of their chance for revenge. Ellaria tells the sisters they must either choose Doran's way and peace, or her way and war. After Tyene and Nymeria agree to side with Ellaria, Obara makes her point by recounting how her father came to claim her, though her mother protested that she was too young and a girl. Oberyn tossed his spear at Obara's feet and said: "girl or boy, we fight our battles, but the gods let us choose our weapons." He pointed to the spear and then to her mother's tears, and Obara picked up the spear. Then, Obara kills their captive, saying she made her decision a long time ago. [7]
            When the Sand Snakes make their attempt to kidnap Myrcella, Obara leads the attack, going after Jaime Lannister herself while her sisters battle Bronn. Having her father's skill with a spear, Obara is able to easily force Jaime back, allowing Nymeria to seize Myrcella without interference. However, the battle is quickly broken up by Areo Hotah and the rest of Doran's personal guard. Obara angrily challenges Areo by saying she fights for Dorne, asking who he fights for; Areo simply repeats his command that she drop her weapon. After a tense pause, Obara nods to her sisters and they do so. They, along with Jaime, Bronn and Ellaria Sand, are taken into custody.

        <key>Olenna Tyrell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.63.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lady Olenna Tyrell, née Redwyne, was the elderly matriarch of House Tyrell. Lady Olenna had been a mistress of court politics, plotting and intrigue par excellence throughout her life. She was also known for her wit and sarcasm. As a result, Lady Olenna was popularly nicknamed the Queen of Thorns, in reference to the Tyrell sigil - a rose - and her cutting, barbed comments. In many ways she was the de facto head of House Tyrell at the time of the War of the Five Kings and appeared to hold a great deal of influence over the Reach.
            After most of her family are killed in the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, an event orchestrated by Cersei Lannister, Olenna's desire for vengeance leads her to pledge House Tyrell's forces to Daenerys Targaryen. However, when Daenerys sends her forces to take Casterly Rock, Jaime Lannister's army sacks Highgarden. Offering Olenna a peaceful end, he allows her to drink poison. However, before dying she reveals that she was the one who murdered his son Joffrey at the Purple Wedding.
            Olenna Tyrell was the widow of Lord Luthor Tyrell and the mother of Mace Tyrell, the former Lord of Highgarden, Warden of the South, Lord Paramount of the Reach, and head of House Tyrell. She was the grandmother of his children, Loras and Margaery. She was born into House Redwyne, one of the most prominent and powerful vassals of House Tyrell.[1][2]
            In her youth, Olenna Redwyne was engaged to a member of House Targaryen, as it was "all the rage" at the time; it was her sister Viola to whom Luthor Tyrell was expected to marry. However, Olenna instantly dismissed the idea upon clapping eyes on her "ludicrously silver-haired" fiancée and instead set her sights on Luthor. The night before the proposal, Olenna purportedly got lost on her way back from her embroidery lesson, stumbled upon the room in which Luthor was staying and proceeded to seduce him, so thoroughly in fact that the poor boy never did propose to Viola because he couldn't walk down the stairs to do it and all he could think about was what Olenna had shown him.[3] Viola's reaction to this change was unrecorded.
            Although Olenna consistently referred to Luthor as an oaf,[4] she was genuinely fond of him, and confided to Margaery that she had some difficulty accepting his death after his body was delivered to her.[5]
            At some point following her granddaughter's engagement to Joffrey Baratheon, Lady Olenna had removed to King's Landing, most likely to work behind the scenes to cement the Tyrells' position, along with an entourage of Tyrell maidens whom she finds exceedingly boring. Reasoning that Sansa Stark is the best person to ask about Joffrey, Olenna invites her to a lunch of lemon cakes (Sansa's favorite) and cheese (her own favorite). Sansa is initially too scared to speak, but after much prodding from Olenna, Sansa breaks down and confesses that Joffery is a monster. Lady Olenna is disappointed but unsurprised at the revelation.[4]
            A few days later, Lady Olenna is sought out by Varys, who finds her chastising her other grandchildren over their unimaginative veneration of House Tyrell's dull sigil. Olenna throws a mild barb or two at him, proving herself one of the few able to hold her own against Varys' honeyed silver-tongue before demanding his reasons for seeking her, aware of the Spider's reputation. They discuss Sansa and Littlefinger's interest in her.
            Varys warns her just how dangerous Littlefinger really is, and Olenna agrees that Sansa must be kept away from him. When Varys is about to offer a solution, Olenna dismisses him, saying that the solution is rather obvious. [6]
            Hoping to mitigate the potential costs of an extravagant royal wedding, Tyrion Lannister meets with Lady Olenna. She lectures him on the importance of an extravagant royal wedding, particularly if it, along with the large amounts of grain and livestock brought to King's Landing from the Reach, prevents the Smallfolk from ripping the nobles apart for a bit of change. Lady Olenna also reminds Tyrion of the thousands of Tyrell troops now assisting the Lannisters in the current war, and that the royal house traditionally pays for a royal wedding.
            Nonetheless, she agrees to pay half the costs of the wedding itself provided the celebrations are not cut short. Lady Olenna expresses disappointment in Tyrion's character– she had hoped to encounter the lecherous, mischievous imp of legend, and not a "browbeaten bookkeeper"– and in Podrick Payne's serving abilities before departing.[7]
            After he finds out about the plan to wed Loras to Sansa, Tywin Lannister, determined to thwart this plan, which would hand control of the North to the Tyrells, meets with Lady Olenna. He instead offers to marry Loras to Cersei (both of them pretend that there is no outstanding plot). Olenna, claiming herself an expert on the subject, declares Cersei too old, and will soon be undergoing "the change". Tywin counters by mentioning Loras's homosexuality. Olenna bluntly confirms that her grandson is a "sword swallower", and cheekily asks whether Tywin ever experimented in his youth, a suggestion the Hand adamantly refutes. Olenna makes light of what amounts to "a discreet bit of buggery", and hints at the rumors of incest between Cersei and Jaime, which, she notes, currently have Westeros at war. Tywin says that neither he nor Olenna care what other people think of them (an assertion she refutes). He proceeds to call her bluff by threatening to name Loras to the Kingsguard, thereby exchanging the uncertainty of Cersei's childbearing status for the certainty of House Tyrell's extinction. Olenna snaps Tywin's quill in half and graciously concedes defeat.

        <key>Nymeria Sand</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.64.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nymeria Sand, often called "Nym" for short, was one of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, the Sand Snakes. Along with her father's paramour, Ellaria Sand, and her half-sisters Obara Sand and Tyene Sand, she takes part in the Coup in Dorne, during which they seize power in Dorne from the legitimate House Martell. She is ultimately killed by Euron Greyjoy in his ambush of the Iron Fleet.
            Nymeria Sand is the second of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the "Sand Snakes". Nymeria's mother was an Eastern noblewoman, who taught her how to use a whip in combat, but who later died in battle.[1] Nymeria became very skilled with using her 8 foot long bullwhip in combat.[2]
            Nymeria inherited her father's cunning, and is the most observant and calculating of the Sand Snakes. Instead of charging head-on into a situation relying on brute strength (like her older sister Obara), she will stand back and observe her enemy's weak points, then move in precisely for an accurate strike. In this, she is actually more like her uncle, Doran Martell, than like her father. Her choice of a bullwhip as her primary weapon exemplifies this mentality. She hones her reflexes by playing a sparring game with her younger sister Tyene, in which one slaps the other's hands before they can move them; Nymeria claims she has never lost this game.[3]
            Nymeria dresses more femininely than her martial sister Obara, though she is no less deadly. Nymeria has long flowing hair, and alluring Dornish-style dresses.[4]
            She is named after Nymeria, the warrior-queen of the Rhoynar who led her people's migration to Dorne one thousand years ago. The original Nymeria unified Dorne for the first time, and is considered the founder of House Martell in its modern form. "Nymeria" is a popular name in Dorne, much as "Brandon" is in the North, after their founder Brandon the Builder. Through her father Oberyn, Nymeria Sand is actually a direct descendant of the original Nymeria.
            Oberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to Queen Cersei Lannister.[5]
            When Ellaria Sand goes to the Water Gardens to scold Doran for his inaction to Oberyn's murder, she tells the Prince that Dorne must go to war against the Lannisters, and points out that the Sand Snakes, who have the love of their people, agree with her, and that they will avenge their father if Doran does not.[6]
            Nymeria, Tyene, and Obara meet with Ellaria to discuss rallying Dorne to go to war against House Lannister. When the conversation shifts to Myrcella Baratheon, Obara reveals information she received from a merchant captain that Jaime Lannister has been smuggled into Dorne. Ellaria insists that they must stop Jaime from reaching Myrcella. They are presented with a choice: side with Doran and have peace, or side with Ellaria and have war. Nymeria, Tyene, and Obara agree to side with Ellaria.[7]
            During the attempted kidnapping of Myrcella, Nymeria initially attacks Jaime with her whip but quickly switches to Bronn, aided by Tyene, while Obara drives Jaime away from the others. Obara barks at Nym to "take her" and Nym breaks off from the fight and grabs Myrcella by the arm. Myrcella resists, but Nym silences her by brandishing a knife in her face. However, as she tries to drag her away they are cut off and surrounded by Areo Hotah and the rest of Prince Doran's personal guard. Areo forces Nym and her sisters to drop their weapons, and they, along with Jaime, Bronn and Ellaria, are arrested.[8]
            The Sand Snakes share a prison cell next to Bronn, which proves irritating to Nym and Obara as Bronn continues singing "The Dornishman's Wife". When Tyene begins flirting with Bronn, Nym looks bored until he begins succumbing to his poisoned wound; she and Obara watch with amusement as Tyene toys with Bronn's life before finally giving him the antidote.[9]
            Nym spends her time in the cell playing a game of reflexes with Tyene, while Obara ignores them and tries to sleep. Nym mocks Tyene as she repeatedly slaps her hands, claiming she has never lost the game and that her little sister must enjoy either humiliation or pain. Tyene claims she overthinks things, causing Nym to hesitate; when she swings again, Tyene moves her hands away in time. Nym mocks her again as she offers her own hands, but Tyene instead slaps her across the face, angering her. Their argument is interrupted by the arrival of Areo Hotah.[10]
            Later, Nym, Obara and Tyene- bound at the wrists- witness Ellaria swear allegiance to Doran Martell, ending her rebellion.
            Nym is present with her sisters and Ellaria on the docks to see Jaime, Myrcella, and Trystane off; however, Ellaria had poisoned Myrcella with a kiss before she left on the boat. As the poison begins to work on Ellaria as well she drinks the antidotes, and the three sisters leave the docks with Ellaria, satisfied that they were able to avenge Oberyn, if only slightly.[11]
            Ellaria stages a coup in Dorne that claims the life of Doran and Hotah, and sends Nym with Obara to ambush Trystane. Though Trystane chooses to fight Nym, Obara impales him in the head from behind, to Nym's chagrin, who calls Obara a "greedy bitch", as she had been looking forward to murdering her own cousin.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Nymeria_Sand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemNymeriaSand</string></dict>
        <key>Nymeria</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.65.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nymeria was the warrior-queen who led the Rhoynar refugees to Dorne a thousand years ago. She is an ancestor of House Martell and House Dayne, and is seen as the founder of Dorne as a unified realm under Martell rule.
            The Rhoynar once lived in city-states along the Rhoyne River. About a thousand years ago (perhaps 700 years before the Targaryen Conquest), the Rhoynar were on the verge of being conquered by the expanding power of the Valyrian Freehold and its dragons. Defeated at the end of the Rhoynish Wars, Nymeria rallied the survivors and fled Essos altogether, sailing in a refugee fleet said to include ten thousand ships. After much wandering she eventually led her people to Dorne, at the southeastern tip of Westeros. After landing, Nymeria had all of the Rhoynar's 10,000 ships burned, so that none would have second thoughts about staying.
            At the time, Dorne was divided into many petty kingdoms and had never been unified. Impressed by Nymeria, local king Mors Martell married her and united her forces with his own. Together, they conquered and unified all of Dorne for the first time, reigning from the Martell's seat at Sunspear.[1][2] At some point later, she would marry Davos Dayne.[3] Dorne was the last of the Seven Kingdoms to join the realm; however, it did not join through conquest, but rather through marriage two centuries later.[1]
            The Dornish revere Nymeria as the founder of their realm, and her descendants in House Martell continued to rule Dorne through the present day. As a result, "Nymeria" actually became a common name in Dorne (comparable to how "Brandon" is a very common name in the North, after their founder, Brandon Stark the Builder). Oberyn Martell - himself a direct descendant of Nymeria, warrior-queen of the Rhoynar - named one of his own bastard daughters Nymeria Sand. Nymeria's fame also spread across Westeros: even young Arya Stark, fascinated with legends about past warrior-queens, chose to name her direwolf "Nymeria".
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Nymeria was the leader of the Rhoynar refugees and is seen as the founder of unified Dorne. Before the Valyrians defeated the coalition of Rhoynar city-states, Nymeria herself was the ruling Princess of Ny Sar.
            After Nymeria died she was succeeded by her eldest child, her daughter with Mors Martell. Within her own lifetime she was able to enforce the gender-blind equal primogeniture laws of the Rhoynar in Dorne, even though she had a younger son by a different husband (after Mors died) who by the laws of the Andals would have inherited rule of Dorne after her.
            A minor detail in the books is that after Nymeria married Mors Martell, the formal name of their descendants' House actually became "House Nymeros Martell" (Nymeros meaning "of Nymeria"), combining their two names. The TV series has not mentioned this, though it is rarely mentioned in the books either.
            "Nymeria" became a popular name in Dorne in later generations. Even Arya Stark named her direwolf "Nymeria" after her. In the novels, her choice of name for her direwolf is specifically explained in the first novel: in contrast with her refined sister Sansa Stark, who gave her direwolf the elegant name "Lady", the tomboyish Arya named her direwolf after a famous warrior-queen. The TV series didn't do this in Season 1, though certainly because even Dorne itself had not yet been introduced and it would have taken a long time to explain.
            Nymeria is remembered as a warrior-queen, though she actually was not a warrior herself, in the sense of carrying and wielding weapons. She was considered a warrior for being a cunning military strategist and commander of armies (comparable to how in his later years Tywin Lannister was considered a dangerous war-leader, without actually wielding his own sword anymore). That being said, many of the Rhoynar refugees in her army were female, because Rhoynar women were taught to fight alongside their men (and most of the men had died fighting the Valyrians).
            As the founder of one of the Seven Kingdoms, Nymeria is revered in Dorne much as Brandon Stark the Builder is revered in the North, Lann the Clever in the Westerlands, or Garth Greenhand in the Reach. A major difference however is that these figures all lived over six thousand years ago in the Age of Heroes, before written accounts, and all of the tales about them are shrouded in legend - many maesters question if "Bran the Builder" or "Lann the Clever" ever truly existed at all, or are just folklore. In contrast, Nymeria unified Dorne only one thousand years ago, long after the times of mythical heroes had progressed into the era of written history, so Nymeria is fully understood to have been a real person.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Nymeria</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemNymeria</string></dict>

        <key>Maggy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.67.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Maggy is a woods witch and reputed fortune teller living in a hut in the woods near Casterly Rock.
            When she was a teenager, Cersei Lannister went to visit Maggy at her hut in the woods, accompanied by Melara Hetherspoon, because she had heard that the witch could read people's futures. Cersei entered Maggy's hut uninvited, but when Maggy woke and demanded that she get out, Cersei arrogantly pointed out that Maggy was on her father Tywin Lannister's lands, and threatened that she would have her eyes gouged out if she refused her. Chuckling, Maggy relented and asked Cersei for a taste of her blood, handing her knife to cut her finger with. Cersei complied and Maggy then literally sucked some blood from the cut, as part of her blood magic. Maggy told Cersei that she could ask three questions, but mocked the prideful young girl that she wouldn't like the answers.
            Maggy let Cersei ask three questions. First, Cersei's father had promised that she would wed Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, and she wanted to know when they would marry. Maggy responded that she wouldn't marry "the prince" but she would marry "the king". Worried, Cersei used her second question to confirm that she would indeed be queen some day. Maggy confirmed that she would, but that in time she would be cast down by another, younger and more beautiful queen, who would take all she held dear. Third, Cersei asked if she and the king would have children. Maggy cryptically replied that the king would have 20 children, but Cersei would have only three. Cersei didn't think that made sense (not realizing that a king can have bastard children), but Maggy continued to say of her three children that gold would be their crowns - and gold their burial shrouds, implying that all of Cersei's children would predecease her.
            Cersei remembers meeting Maggy right before her father's funeral, after he was murdered by her own brother Tyrion. Cersei is disturbed because her eldest son Joffrey has already died, poisoned at his own wedding to Margaery Tyrell, who will now marry her younger son Tommen and become the new queen, while her daughter Myrcella is in Dorne as a ward - and potential hostage - of Doran Martell, brother of the late Oberyn Martell. Cersei fears that Margaery is the younger and more beautiful queen that Maggy warned her about.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Maggy - often called Maggy the Frog - is not simply a Westerosi woods witch, but an Essosi fortune teller living in Lannisport, the wife of a spice merchant who brought her with him from Essos. This spice merchant was the founder of House Spicer and grandfather of Sybell Spicer, the mother of Jeyne Westerling, who later married Robb Stark (Jeyne was changed into the character Talisa for the TV series). The nickname "Maggy" is conjectured to be a slurred mishearing from the foreign word "Maegi".
            Kevan Lannister recalls Maggy as frightening old crone, who was supposed to be a priestess, and that half of Lannisport used to go to her for cures and love potions. Based on Kevan's comment there is a fan theory that Sybelle Spicer might have not only concocted a contraceptive for her daughter, to prevent her from getting pregnant by Robb (as she reveals to Jaime), but also a love potion, to make Robb susceptible to Jeyne's advances.
            In the fifth novel, while Cersei performs her walk of atonement, she hallucinates that Maggy is standing in the crowd with her pendulous teats and her warty greenish skin, leering with the rest, with malice shining from her crusty yellow eyes, hissing the prophecy about another queen who will cast Cersei down and take all she holds most dear.
            In the novels, Maggy looks much like a stereotypical ugly fairy tale witch: very old, squat and warty, with no teeth, crusty yellow eyes, and pale green jowls - hence why she is called "Maggy the Frog".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Maggy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMaggy</string></dict>
        <key>Mhaegen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.68.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mhaegen is a prostitute and the mother of the royal bastard Barra.
            Mhaegen is a prostitute working and living at a brothel in King's Landing. She works for Lord Petyr Baelish. She is known to King Robert Baratheon and is a former favorite of his. They have an illegitimate daughter named Barra.
            Hand of the King Eddard Stark visits Mhaegen while following the investigation of his predecessor Jon Arryn. She shows him Barra and they discuss her relationship with King Robert.[1]
            Goldcloaks led by Lord Janos Slynt break into Lord Baelish's establishment, along with a man who identifies Mhaegen as the mother of one of King Robert's bastards. She resists when the goldcloaks take Barra from her arms. Lord Slynt kills Barra personally after one of his men cannot go through with it. Mhaegen screams and weeps as the goldcloaks restrain her.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mhaegen appears but is not named. She has a a light red hair and freckles on her nose and bosom. Ned estimates she cannot be more than fifteen years old.
            The brothel where Mhaegen works is not owned by Littlefinger but by Chataya, a tall and elegant black-skinned woman from the Summer Islands.
            She is killed by Allar Deem, a goldcloak sent by Lord Slynt, when she tries to protect her baby daughter. She was not explicitly shown to be killed by the goldcloaks in the TV series, thus her status in the TV continuity is uncertain. In the next episode, Ros mentiones to Littlefinger that Mhaegen "works for him" and that "the Gold Cloaks killed her baby" so she most likely survived the encounter.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mhaegen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMhaegen</string></dict>

        <key>Mordane</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.70.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Septa Mordane was the septa at Winterfell and tutor to the daughters of House Stark. She accompanies the household to King's Landing to continue the girls's studies. She was killed by House Lannister men-at-arms following the arrest of Lord Eddard Stark for treason.
            Septa Mordane tutors Arya and Sansa in needlework. She compliments Sansa on the skill of her work, but doesn't remark on Arya's grudging efforts.[1] Mordane accompanies Arya and Sansa to King's Landing and dines with them. She is present at the meal when Arya threatens to kill Joffrey Baratheon for his actions on the Kingsroad and reports this to her father. When Sansa is disdainful of the doll which Eddard Stark gives her and asks to be excused, it is to Septa Mordane that he says, "War was easier than daughters".[2] Mordane shows Sansa the throne room as part of Sansa's tutoring on the history of the Seven Kingdoms. Sansa is concerned over what will happen if she has no sons, only daughters, a concern that Mordane dismisses as highly unlikely.[3]
            Mordane accompanies Arya and Sansa to the Hand's tournament and is present when Littlefinger explains the background of his nickname to Arya.[4] Mordane chaperones Sansa when Joffrey meets her to apologize for his behavior on the Kingsroad.[5]
            She appears to not be as approving of Joffrey as she once was, but Sansa doesn't notice. Sansa is rude to Septa Mordane when she asked the septa of her origins (likely due to Cersei's example being a bad influence).
            After the failed attempt by Sansa's father to remove Joffrey from the Iron Throne following King Robert's death, Mordane hears combat in the courtyard at the Red Keep. Fearing the worst, she orders Sansa to run to her room and bar the door to anyone she does not know. After Sansa leaves, Mordane is confronted by several Lannister soldiers.[6]
            After the North rises in rebellion, Joffrey takes Sansa to the Traitors' Walk and forces her to gaze at her father's head on a spike. He also reveals that he needlessly had Mordane beheaded, and her head placed on a spike next to her father's to Sansa's horror.[7]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Septa Mordane is a loyal servant of House Stark, despite the fact that most of the family worships the Old Gods of the Forest rather than the Seven. She finds Sansa to be a willing, able and promising student. She despairs at the tomboyish Arya, who'd rather be running around the castle and playing with swords. Arya hates to do needle work and when she runs off to watch sword practice, she returns to her room to find Septa Mordane and her mother waiting to have words. Despite this rebellion, she is fond and fiercely protective of both of her charges.
            She travels to King's Landing with Eddard Stark and his daughters. Arya is angry when she hears her praising Princess Myrcella's needlework even though it's not much better than Arya's own, which is always found wanting.
            Septa Mordane goes to the Hand's tourney with Sansa and Jeyne Poole and must leave when Jeyne gets distraught witnessing the death of Ser Hugh of the Vale, pierced in the neck by a splinter of a jousting lance directly in front of them. She leads Jeyne away. Later the Septa chaperones Sansa to the post tourney feast and they are both encouraged to drink wine by Joffrey. When Sansa is ready to go she realizes that Septa Mordane is laying face down on the table asleep and accepts Joffrey's offer of an escort, but Joffrey then tells the Hound to do it and leaves them.
            Sansa is not with Septa Mordane when the attack on Eddard Stark's people takes place in the book. Sansa went to Queen Cersei to plead for her to talk to Lord Eddard after he told Sansa that she and Arya were going to be taken out of the Keep by Stark men and taken to the docks to board a ship for Winterfell. Sansa is so distraught over leaving King's Landing and the breaking of her betrothal to Joffrey, she doesn't know she is betraying her father and putting them all in peril. Cersei promises to help, but then has Sansa escorted to a tower room and locked in under guard. Later Jeyne Poole is pushed into the room and they are both kept there for three days with no idea of what is occurring, other than the little that Jeyne saw of Stark men being killed.
            Sansa is shown Septa Mordane's unrecognizable head on a spike by Joffrey, he takes her to see her father's head up on the walls, where Sansa asks why she was killed as she was god sworn. Joffrey then replies, claiming that she was executed because she was a traitor.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mordane</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMordane</string></dict>

            Months after the mutiny, in which a group of oathbreaking brothers of the Night's Watch seize Craster's Keep, Morag delivers Craster's last son to Karl Tanner, leader of the mutineers, and tells him he's intended to be given to "the gods". Understanding she's referring to the White Walkers, Karl orders the baby to be abandoned at the Haunted Forest to be seized by the creatures.[1]
            After a group of brothers of the Night's Watch raid Craster's Keep and kill all the mutineers, Jon Snow offers Craster's wives protection at Castle Black. Morag refuses, citing how the 'crows' led by Karl have treated them just like Craster did. Jon asks if they want to remain in Craster's Keep, causing Morag to spit on the ground and demand the place to be burned. Morag and the rest choose to find their own way.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there is no mention of a wife of Craster by the name of Morag. The fate of Craster's wives after the mutineers abandon Craster's Keep hasn't been mentioned yet.

        <key>Meera Reed</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.72.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Meera Reed is the elder sister of Jojen Reed, and the only daughter of Howland Reed. Both she and her brother believe Bran Stark to be crucial in the oncoming war against the White Walkers.
            Meera is the eldest child and only daughter of Lord Howland Reed of Greywater Watch. Her sole sibling is her younger brother, Jojen Reed. Having grown up in the North, she is a firm believer in the Old Gods of the Forest.
            As Bran, Rickon, Osha, Hodor, Summer, and Shaggydog are fleeing towards Castle Black following the Sack of Winterfell, Meera surprises Osha by placing a knife to her throat so that Osha will drop her wooden spear aimed on the back of Jojen's neck.[1] Jojen tells that they have been searching for a long time so that they can offer their protection. Osha remarks that Jojen must be ashamed to have to rely on his sister for protection, but Meera dismisses her, claiming that some people will always need protection, but that doesn't mean they are any less of a person.
            Osha and Meera continue to not get along, fighting over simple things like how best to skin a rabbit. Meera also cares for her brother while he is having seizure-like symptoms when he is having visions.[2]
            While in the Gift, the group seeks shelter from a rainstorm in an abandoned windmill when Meera spots a horse. She and the others witness the man being surrounded by wildlings and fear that a scared Hodor yelling will alert the wildlings to their hiding place, but Bran uses his powers to enter Hodor's mind and make him sleep. Bran decides that he and Rickon should separate and that Osha and Shaggydog go with him. Before she leaves, Osha makes Meera and Jojen promise to keep Bran safe.[3]
            Meera arrives with the remaining members of the group at Nightfort, a long unused Night's Watch castle along the Wall. Bran recalls a lot of scary stories he had heard from Old Nan about Nightfort, but Meera expresses her love of scary stories so Bran retells the legend of the Rat Cook. Suddenly, a dark figure appears from a well, frightening the group. Meera pins the figure down, knife in hand, yet it is only Samwell Tarly with Gilly and her baby. After discovering who each other are, Samwell warns Bran and the others of the White Walkers, but Bran insists that although he would like to join Samwell at Castle Black, he and the others must continue on their quest. Samwell supplies them dragonglass, and noticing that Meera uses a bow, gives her extra for her arrows.[4]
            Meera interrupts Bran's warging, stating that he was gone for hours. Jojen warns Bran of the dangers of staying within the minds of others for too long. Meera supports her brother, insisting to Bran that he would forget his friends, his family, his home, and even himself.[5]
            Around their campfire at night, Meera and her companions hears the cries of a baby (Craster's last son left outside by Rast). Bran wargs into Summer to investigate, but notices Ghost in a cage and Summer falls into a trap. They discover the mutineers at Craster's Keep, but Meera insists they leave the area. Bran wants to free the trapped direwolves, but they are ambushed by the mutineers and taken to Karl. Karl threatens Meera and Jojen, which forces Bran to reveal his identity to them.[6]
            Later, Karl and other mutineers prepare to rape Meera in front of her companions, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Jon Snow and the Night's Watch. During the ensuing battle, Locke finds the four of them and takes Bran away, intending to kill him. Bran wargs into Hodor and kills Locke by snapping his neck. As the raid on Craster's Keep continues, Bran, Jojen, Meera, and Hodor escape.[7]
            Meera remains in the Weirwood cave with Bran, Summer, Hodor, Leaf, and the Three-Eyed Raven. After Bran has a vision of his father as a child, he finds Meera sitting just outside the cave entrance. She confides in him that she is having trouble coping with their apparent inaction towards the coming war, and Bran reminds her that it's not safe anywhere outside. After he leaves, a child of the forest tells her that she needs to protect Bran at all costs. [9]
            Meera struggles to pull both Bran and the cart as they continue to run from the White Walkers. Bran remains despondent, and continues to have visions of both past, present, and future. They are eventually found by the Wight horde just as Bran wakes up, and Meera apologizes for not being able to protect him due to their sheer numbers and her exauhstion. Just before the Wights close in, however, a mysterious figure clad in a hooded black cloak arrives, killing the Wights with a flaming chain. He pulls Bran and Meera up onto his horse, and they ride away.
            The mysterious figure, once they have found a safe place to make a fire, reveals himself as Benjen Stark, Bran's uncle, who has previously been thought to be dead. He claims that he was attacked by White Walkers while on a ranging party, and left for dead after being stabbed through the gut, and that the magic of the Children of the Forest saved his life. He also tells Bran that he has now embodied the Three-Eyed Raven, and must face the Night King when the time comes.

When introducing Merry, Lord Walder calls her Wertha, Walra, and Waldina before she meekly corrects him, though he quickly dismisses her.[1] However, during the wedding feast she sits at the main table alongside Walder Frey's wife, Lord Walder himself, and the newlywed couple - the only one of Lord Walder's children (other than the bride Roslin) to sit as his table during the wedding.[2]
            While her grandfather, Walder Frey, is yelling at his sons, "Black" Walder Rivers and Lothar, Merry can briefly be seen feasting in the hall of the Twins with her relatives.[3]
            Merry is among the female Freys serving wine to the male relatives at "Walder's" banquet. She is seen horrified watching the men succumb to poison in the wine, and as Walder Frey turns out to really be Arya Stark wearing Walder's face.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is a granddaughter of Lord Walder named Merianne Frey, who is also known as Merry, who is eleven years old (not to be confused with Marianne Vance, daughter of Walder's daughter Maegelle, whose first name is spelled with an "a" not an "e"). She is the daughter of Ser Whalen Frey and Sylwa Paege. Whalen is the third child of Lord Walder's fourth wife, Alyssa Blackwood. Lame Lothar Frey is Walder's eldest child with Alyssa, making him Whalen's older brother and Merianne's uncle.
            Merry was one of the Frey women presented to Robb Stark when he came to the Twins for Lord Edmure Tully's wedding. When she corrects her grandfather on her name, he refers to her as "Noisy", rather than dismissing her.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Merry_Frey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMerryFrey</string></dict>
        <key>Meria Martell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.75.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Princess Meria Martell was the Prince of Dorne during the War of Conquest.
            Meria Martell was the Princess of the Principality of Dorne before and during Aegon's War of Conquest. When Rhaenys Targaryen went to Sunspear to demand Dorne's surrender to Targaryen rule, Meria turned her away with a warning not to return. Rhaenys did not heed this warning and this led to the First Dornish War, in which the Targaryens attempted to subdue Dorne the same way they had defeated the armies of House Lannister and House Gardener in the Field of Fire. Rhaenys, her dragon Meraxes and all of her soldiers were killed, and Aegon never attempted to conquer Dorne again.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Meria was around eighty years old, fat, blind and almost bald when the War of Conquest took place. She was called the "Yellow Toad of Dorne" by the Storm King Argilac Durrandon.
            When he began his Conquest, Aegon I Targaryen sent ravens to all of the rulers of Westeros demanding that they yield to him as the sole king of the realm and be rewarded or be destroyed. Meria replied that she would help him defeat the Storm King, but would not yield to him.
            Rhaenys Targaryen led the invasion of Dorne during the Conquest, and the Dornishmen refused to give battle but instead launched guerilla raids on Rhaenyra's forces before retreating into the mountains and deserts. The men deserted the Dornish keeps and when Rhaenys asked the women and children where they had gone, they simply replied "away". Rhaenys then flew to Sunspear on her dragon Meraxes and met Princess Meria alone, demanding that Dorne surrender to Targaryen rule. Meria replied that Dorne would never surrender and warned Rhaenys not to return, and the Targaryen army left without conquering Dorne.
            Aegon launched a new campaign against Dorne which lasted many years, the First Dornish War, in 4 AC. Meria and the other Dornish lords abandoned their keeps, and the Targaryens found Sunspear empty and declared themselves victorious. They placed Lord Rosby and Lord Harlen Tyrell in charge of the city before returning to King's Landing. The Dornish then attacked the city and retook the castle, and Meria had Lord Rosby forced to the top of the Spear Tower, where she personally threw him from the window. Lord Tyrell attempted to retake Sunspear from her forces by setting out from Hellholt take the Vaith, but he vanished in the Dornish deserts and was never seen again.
            Meria continued to resist the Targaryens until she died in 13 AC and was succeeded by her son Prince Nymor, who immediately began negotiating peace.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Meria_Martell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMeriaMartell</string></dict>
        <key>Margaery Tyrell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.76.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Margaery Tyrell was the only daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell and Lady Alerie Tyrell, granddaughter of Lady Olenna Tyrell and sister of Ser Loras Tyrell. Margaery became Queen Consort through her marriage to King Joffrey Baratheon, and later his younger brother, King Tommen Baratheon, following Joffrey's death. Her desire to become Queen, however, ultimately proved to be her downfall as she was eventually killed along with her brother and father when the Great Sept of Baelor was destroyed with wildfire as orchestrated by Cersei Lannister to reclaim her lost power.
            Margaery is the only daughter of Lady Alerie Tyrell and Lord Mace Tyrell, the Lord Paramount of the Reach. The Reach is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Tyrell is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Margaery was raised in privilege in the family seat and regional capital of Highgarden. She is close to her brother, Ser Loras Tyrell, the Knight of Flowers. She is also close to her handmaidens, Sera Durwell and Mira Forrester, who followed her to King's Landing from Highgarden. She is said to be as beautiful as she is clever.[1]
            Margaery marries King Renly Baratheon, the lover of her brother Loras, though she's aware of their relationship. Two weeks afterward they have not yet consummated their marriage. Renly camps his army in the Stormlands, near his seat of Storm's End, and holds a tournament for his followers. Margaery is disappointed when Loras is defeated in the final bout by Brienne of Tarth. Catelyn Stark arrives to treat with Renly on behalf of her son Robb Stark and Margaery greets her warmly. Margaery encourages Renly to produce an heir with her but he is unable to become aroused by her. She is pragmatic about his desires and shocks him by offering to bring Loras into their bed.[2]
            King Joffrey Baratheon's Master of Coin Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish also visits the camp to treat with Renly. He makes a point of provoking Margaery about her husband's sexuality and she affirms her loyalty to Renly. Renly treats with his brother King Stannis Baratheon but is unable to reach a compromise.[3] Renly is killed in mysterious circumstances and his Kingsguard Brienne of Tarth is blamed for his death. Margaery convinces Loras to flee the camp with her before Stannis arrives. Littlefinger accompanies them to Highgarden having gauged Margaery's ambition to become Queen.[4]
            Petyr sways House Tyrell into siding with House Lannister. As a result, House Lannister is victorious at the Battle of the Blackwater.[5][6]
            In a ceremony to celebrate victory, King Joffrey tells Loras he may ask anything of him in return for his aid. He asks Joffrey to wed Margaery to cement the new alliance between their Houses through matrimony. Margaery states she has heard of Joffrey's courage and come to love him from afar. Joffrey states that he has heard of Margaery's beauty and reciprocates her feelings but balks at setting aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark. He is convinced by his courtiers that Sansa's family's status as attainted traitors is reason enough.[7]
            Lady Margaery Tyrell accompanied her betrothed King Joffrey back from the Great Sept of Baelor in a heavily guarded palanquin. Against official protocol, she stopped the procession in Flea Bottom unexpectedly. To the shock of her guards and the bewilderment of Joffrey, Margaery stepped out of her carriage and began exploring the streets.
            She eventually arrived at an orphanage and began interacting with the children. Meanwhile, her servants distributed bread and toys, earning her the love of Flea Bottom's smallfolk. That evening, Margaery and her brother Loras Tyrell were visited by Joffrey and his mother Cersei. Cersei was unhappy with Margaery's earlier actions and admonished her boldness; reminding her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the royal party was assaulted weeks earlier. During this argument, Joffrey defended Margaery and criticized his mother. As a result, Cersei realized that she was on the verge of being outmaneuvered by the Tyrells. While Cersei only knew how to rule through fear, Margaery was adept at winning the hearts and minds of her people, a skill which Cersei lacked.[8]
            Later, Margaery and her grandmother, Lady Olenna Tyrell, invited Sansa for a private meeting with them at the gardens of King’s Landing. Loras escorted Sansa to the gardens for the meeting. During the meeting, Lady Olenna dismissed her father Mace as a fool for supporting Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne. By contrast, Margaery spoke well of her late husband Renly.
            During the meeting, Olenna insisted that Sansa tell them the truth about what Joffrey was like since Margaery was to marry him. While Sansa was initially reluctant to share her feelings, she admitted that Joffrey was a "monster" since he had reneged on his earlier promise to spare her father’s life. While Olenna was disappointed at these revelations, she was not surprised given the rumors that have been circulating about Joffrey's public outbursts. While Sansa was worried that this would mean that the Tyrells would cancel their proposed marriage alliance (meaning Sansa will be stuck with Joffrey again), Olenna assured her that her son Mace was too intent on Margaery entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Margaery_Tyrell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMargaeryTyrell</string></dict>
        <key>Maege Mormont</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.77.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lady Maege Mormont was the head of House Mormont, the Lords of Bear Island and a vassal of House Stark. She fought for Robb Stark, the King in the North, during the War of the Five Kings.
            Maege Mormont was the Lady of Bear Island and the head of House Mormont, a vassal to House Stark of Winterfell. She had one daughter, Lyanna, namesake of Lyanna Stark, Lord Eddard Stark's sister. Lord Commander Jeor Mormont of the Night's Watch is her older brother. The disgraced and exiled Ser Jorah Mormont is her nephew.
            Lady Mormont was present at the feast for the Northern lords held in the Great Hall of Winterfell in which Greatjon Umber defied Robb Stark only to submit after two of his fingers were mutilated by Grey Wind. She was also present at the a war council discussing strategy with Robb Stark and his other bannermen in their camp at Moat Cailin.[1] She can be seen leading a force of men behind Robb as they arrived at The Twins.[2]
            Maege was also present when the Greatjon proclaimed Robb Stark the King in the North. Prior to the proclamation, Maege laughed loudly when the Greatjon complained about the southern gods worshiped by Renly and Stannis Baratheon.[3]
            Stannis Baratheon mentions that Lyanna Mormont is Lady of Bear Island, implying Maege may have perished during the War of the Five Kings.[4]
            It was confirmed that she died fighting for Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings.[5]
            * - Uncredited appearance
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lady Maege, also known as "the She-Bear", is a stout, grey-haired woman and a fierce warrior. She dresses in mail and her favored weapon is a spiked mace. Catelyn Stark observes that Maege seems more comfortable in armor than Brienne of Tarth ever did. According to her brother Jeor, she is stubborn, short-tempered, and willful. She worked hard to regain the family's noble name and recover from the state of near-poverty her nephew Jorah had left behind.
            When Robb Stark calls his bannerman to march south after Eddard Stark's arrest and they start to test him due his youth, Maege tells Robb bluntly that he was young enough to be her grandson, and had no business giving her commands, but she had a granddaughter she would be willing to have him marry. Maege is more understanding of Catelyn Stark releasing Ser Jaime Lannister, and Catelyn has grown fond of her. Maege does not attend the Red Wedding, as along the way from Riverrun to the Twins, Robb commands her and Galbart Glover to take men by separate longships and sail through the marshes of the Neck to seek out Howland Reed. He gives them letters for the Northern lords, explaining the letters contain false orders, in case they are captured by the ironborn. It remains unknown if Maege or Galbart Glover reached their destination, and whether they are alive.
            Maege has five children, all daughters: Dacey, Alysane, Lyra, Jorelle, and Lyanna. Lyanna is only ten years old during the fourth and fifth novels. Alysane had a son and daughter by an unknown father. Dacey was a warrior-woman like her mother and sisters and a member of Robb Stark's personal guard; she was killed during the Red Wedding. Dacey was one of the few of Robb's bannermen who managed to get to her feet, fighting off Benfrey Frey by smashing his face in with a wine flagon. She then made a death run for the feast hall's doors and managed to avoid being shot by the crossbowmen in the balcony, but just before she reached the door, Ryman Frey and a dozen more fully armed Frey men-at-arms came bursting through it and ran right into her. Dacey died when Ryman drove his longaxe into her stomach.
            While Stannis's host marches to Winterfell, Alysane tells the captive Asha Greyjoy that her sisters "Lyra and Jory are with our mother" - implying that Maege's whereabouts and activities following the Red Wedding are known only to her daughters, perhaps to be revealed in later novels.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Maege_Mormont</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMaegeMormont</string></dict>

            Marianne is one of the many granddaughters of Walder Frey, the Lord of the Crossing.
            Along with several of Lord Frey's other daughters and granddaughters, Robb Stark had the option of marrying her. When he arrives at The Twins for his uncle Edmure's wedding, Robb apologizes for his slight against them.[1]
            Marianne is present when Edmure Tully is brought into the hall by Walder Frey. [2]
            After the Second Siege of Riverrun, Marianne is seen celebrating in the background at the victory feast after the Freys and Lannisters have taken Riverrun.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lord Walder has no granddaughter named "Marianne". He does have a great-granddaughter named Marianne Vance, daughter of Ser Dafyn Vance and Maegelle Frey. This Marianne is herself the granddaughter of Walder's eldest son, Ser Stevron Frey.

        <key>Marya Seaworth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.79.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Marya Seaworth is the wife of Ser Davos Seaworth and mother of Matthos Seaworth.
            Davos saved up enough money through his smuggling to purchase a small plot of land. He then found a woman, Marya, kind enough to overlook his trade.[1] Salladhor Saan attended their wedding feast.[2] She gave him a son they named Matthos. Marya and Davos hoped that he would eventually save enough riches so he could quit smuggling.[1]
            Melisandre asks Davos if he loves his wife to which he replies he does. She asserts that he answers that way yet he has known other women and Davos tells her not to talk about his wife anymore. Melisandre says that she is speaking of other women like herself and asserts that Davos wants her.[3]
            After rescuing Davos, Salladhor Saan advises him to return to Marya so he can comfort her following their son's death, but Davos demands to be taken to Dragonstone to stop Melisandre. Salladhor agrees but jokes that, after Davos is killed, he will gather his bones so that Marya can wear them around her neck.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Marya is the daughter of a common carpenter. She has seven sons with Davos: Dale, Allard, Matthos, Marc, Devan, Stannis (named after the king), and Steffon. While Davos went with Stannis' household to Dragonstone, Marya remained at the family keep in Cape Wrath to raise their two youngest sons. Of Marya's other five sons, only Devan survived after the Battle of Blackwater.
            While Davos is imprisoned at the White Harbor, uncertain what fate has in store for him, he writes Marya a letter: "I was a better smuggler than a knight, a better knight than a King's Hand, a better King's Hand than a husband. I am so sorry. Marya, I have loved you. Please forgive the wrongs I did you. Should Stannis lose his war, our lands will be lost as well. Take the boys across the narrow sea to Braavos and teach them to think kindly of me, if you would. Should Stannis gain the Iron Throne, House Seaworth will survive and Devan will remain at court. He will help you place the other boys with noble lords, where they can serve as pages and squires and win their knighthoods". Before leaving the cell, he asks Robett Glover to send the letter, in case he dies. Robett promises Davos he will.
            Marya is described as good-natured, plump woman with sagging breasts and a kindly smile.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Marya_Seaworth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMaryaSeaworth</string></dict>

        <key>Masha Heddle</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.81.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Masha Heddle is the innkeeper at the busy and successful Crossroads Inn.
            Catelyn Stark and Ser Rodrik Cassel are stopping at the Crossroads Inn and are trying to be inconspicuous. The minstrel Marillion is trying to make a good impression on them, which fails when he insults the North (not realizing they are Northerners). Masha Heddle tells Tyrion Lannister upon his arrival that they have no spare rooms, but Tyrion holds up a gold coin and asks if anyone has a room for him. The sellsword Bronn says that Tyrion can have his room, and Tyrion throws him the coin. Marillion attracts Tyrion's attention to their table by offering to sing Tyrion songs of his father's war victories. Tyrion remarks that nothing would more likely ruin his appetite.
            Though she tries to turn her face away, Tyrion recognizes Catelyn Stark, Masha Heddle curtsies to her, as she knows she is the daughter of Hoster Tully, the Lord of the Riverlands. Catelyn had not planned to do so, but she calls on the knights and men at arms in the inn, many of them sworn to her father's bannermen, to arrest Tyrion for the crime of attempted murder of Bran Stark.[1]
            In A Song of Ice and Fire, Masha Heddle is a middle-aged fat woman, whose teeth have been turned blood-red due to her addiction to sourleaf. She has run the Crossroads Inn for more than twenty years. Catelyn remembers those red teeth being terrifying to her when she was young.
            Hot Pie ends up making bread for a different inn named the Inn of the Kneeling Man.
            Masha Heddle was killed at the end of the first novel, when the Lannister armies overrun the Riverlands. Tywin Lannister has her hanged from a gibbet for allowing Catelyn Stark to kidnap his son. Tyrion is quite pleased at this, although Masha was just an innocent bystander and didn't have any choice whether Catelyn took him prisoner or not. He laughs when he hears his father took the inn for his quarters, thinking "perhaps the gods were just after all". Looking at what remained of Masha's corpse, he says with a sigh of reproach "A room, a meal, and a flagon of wine, that was all I asked".
            The inn is subsequently run by Masha's nephew. Masha's death hasn't been explicitly established in the TV series. In the Season 3 episode "Dark Wings, Dark Words", Arya Stark and the Brotherhood Without Banners have a meal at the Inn at the Crossroads: in the books, they were much further south at a different inn known as the Inn of the Kneeling Man, located south of the Red Fork of the Trident River. In the subsequent episode, "Walk of Punishment", Hot Pie stays behind at the inn to bake bread, because as a former baker's apprentice in King's Landing, he impressed the innkeeper with his skills. This happens with the innkeeper of the Inn of the Kneeling Man in the books. However, Hot Pie only says that "the innkeeper" was impressed by his baking skills: this doesn't necessarily mean that Masha is still alive in the TV continuity, as Hot Pie doesn't state what the specific name of "the innkeeper" is.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Masha_Heddle</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMashaHeddle</string></dict>
        <key>Marei</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.82.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Marei is a prostitute in the King's Landing brothel owned by Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish.
            She is a new prostitute in the brothel owned by Lord Petyr Baelish. She is training with a male prostitute and receives instructions on how to act aroused by the veteran Ros.[1]
            Later, a customer of the brothel watches Marei having sex with the same male prostitute through a spy-hole in the wall of one of the brothel's rooms.[2]
            Marei is the second of three prostitutes being offered to Oberyn Martell and Ellaria Sand by Olyvar (the first prostitute was dismissed as too timid). Ellaria is delighted to see that Marei is "not timid". When Oberyn asks her if she likes women, Marei says that she does, as long as they look like Ellaria, prompting the Dornish paramour to compliment Marei's good taste. She begins kissing Ellaria, but they are interrupted when Oberyn storms out of the room to confront two Lannister soldiers.[5]
            Marei later indeed services Ellaria during a private orgy also involving Oberyn, Olyvar, and a third prostitute, possibly to celebrate the recent assassination of King Joffrey Baratheon at his own wedding. Lord Tywin Lannister then interrupts, entering the room and saying he wants to discuss political matters with Prince Oberyn in private - particularly, that he wants Oberyn to be a judge at his son Tyrion's trial, and will give him a seat on the Small Council to ensure that Dorne continues to support Joffrey's younger brother Tommen. Marei and the other prostitutes quickly leave, along with Ellaria.[6]
            When the Faith Militant is rearmed, they storm Littlefinger's brothel, driving out all of the prostitutes and clients. Marei is interrupted while in the middle of having sex with a man, and they drag her out of the brothel by her hair while she screams in terror. Olyvar tries to intervene with the man hauling her out but he simply gets hit in the face.[7]
            Marei apparently managed to survive any rough treatment by the Faith Militant. Months later she is shown naked in Grand Maester Pycelle's chambers after a night of sex (much as he earlier had sex with Ros and Daisy). As he gets ready to head out for the day, she gets annoyed and asks him where her money is. He waves her aside and says he'll pay later, at which she leaves. Pycelle did not live to pay her, however, as he was subsequently assassinated by the Little birds at the order of Cersei Lannister and Qyburn.[8]
            Marei first appeared in the Season 2 premiere, but wasn't formally introduced and given a name until the third episode of Season 3. As of Season 6, following the death of Ros in Season 3, Marei is the longest recurring prostitute character in the series, both in total number of seasons and continuous seasons in a row. By this point she has appeared in seven episodes across five seasons starting with Season 2.
            Ros did appear in more episodes overall (fourteen) and had more screentime, but she only appeared in three seasons (in a row). Marei surpassed Ros as the longest recurring prostitute character in Season 5 - arguably Shae might be counted as recurring longer than Ros, with four continuous seasons, but she wasn't a character invented for the TV series. Either way, Marei's return in Season 6 means she has appeared in five continuous seasons of the TV series, also surpassing Shae's record.
            Even if Marei didn't reappear in Season 7, with the TV series slated to last through Season 8, the only possible way that another character could match her record of five continuous seasons is if they first appeared in Season 3. None of the other minor prostitute characters introduced in Seasons 1 or 2 reappeared afterwards (save for Ros and Shae who are now dead), and as it turned out, the only other prostitutes introduced in Season 3 who returned in Season 4 were Kayla the contortionist and Olyvar, the male prostitute who worked as a spy for Littlefinger. Marei and Olyvar returned in Season 5, but Kyra did not, then even Olyvar didn't reappear in Season 6. Thus it is now mathematically impossible for any other prostitute character to appear in more seasons than Marei already has, and Gillan has also confirmed that she in fact will be reappearing in Season 7.
            Josephine Gillan explained in an interview after Season 5 that for the episode "Sons of the Harpy", when the Faith Militant storm Littlefinger's brothel and drag Marei out of the building, it was originally planned that they would punch Marei in the face, so hard (possibly breaking Marei's nose or jaw) that Gillan was going to need to have a large amount of fake blood continuing to pour out of her mouth as she is dragged away. The production team later decided, however, that seeing a woman beaten up like this was too dark and violent for the needs of the scene, and just had her dragged away by her hair.[9]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is a prostitute named Marei at Chataya's establishment. She is a fairly minor character, and apart from the name and the general fact that she is a prostitute in King's Landing, Marei in the TV series isn't particularly based on Marei from the books (in fact, the TV character was only given the name the season after she was introduced). Most of Marei's scenes so far in the TV series have no direct counterpart in the narrative of the novels. Nonetheless she is not, strictly speaking, a character entirely "invented" for the TV series the way Ros or Armeca were.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Marei</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMarei</string></dict>

            Lollys Stokeworth is a member of House Stokeworth, a noble family of the Crownlands, and the second daughter of Lady Tanda Stokeworth. She is considered dim-witted by Tyrion Lannister.
            Cersei Lannister arranges for a marriage between Lollys and Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, to sway the ambitious ex-sellsword from Tyrion Lannister's service. Though her older sister, Falyse, is heir to Castle Stokeworth, she is forty years old and barren, and Bronn suggests to Tyrion that she may suffer an "accident" in time, making Lollys the sole heir.[1]
            Lollys is enjoying a walk with her betrothed, Ser Bronn, outside of Castle Stokeworth while discussing their upcoming wedding. She also confesses to Bronn how her sister Falyse is mean to her and will not let the couple live at Stokeworth when their mother dies. Bronn comforts Lollys, believing that mean people will always get what they deserve. The two are interrupted by Jaime Lannister, who intends to recruit Bronn on a mission to Dorne in exchange for a better wife and castle, since Cersei Lannister has broken her agreement with Bronn and Lollys will instead marry Ser Wyllis Bracken.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, her background remains the same. However, she is a fairly regular background character during the course of the first three books. She is morbidly obese and is considered simple. In addition, she is second in line for the inheritance of House Stokeworth's lands and titles, so there are no suitors for her hand; her mother, Lady Tanda, is desperate to find a match for her, even relentlessly pursuing Tyrion for a time.
            Lollys is a victim in the Riot of King's Landing, where she is ambushed and gang-raped by fifty men in Flea Bottom, which results in her pregnancy with a bastard child. After this, she is considered defiled and is left a social pariah at court. This makes her an ideal match for Bronn, who as an "upjumped cutthroat" is also considered too low for suitable noble matches, yet now their circumstances have met in the middle.
            Shae, while acting as secret mistress to Tyrion during his stint as Hand of the King, served a time as hand-maiden to Lollys, before coming into Sansa Stark's service following her marriage to Tyrion. She tells Tyrion discontentedly that Lollys sleeps and eats all day, and sometimes she falls asleep while she’s eating, then the food falls under the blankets and Shae has to clean her. Shae knows that Lollys was gang-raped, but has no sympathy for her.
            During the Battle of the Blackwater, Lollys stays with her mother and sister in the Red Keep. They are invited by Cersei Lannister to seek refuge with her in the Queen's Ballroom at Maegor's Holdfast. When they are about to cross the drawbridge, Lollys becomes frightened and refuses to cross, clutches at Shae and sobbing, "I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to." Sansa notices that Shae looks as if she wants to shove Lollys into the dry moat, onto the iron spikes. Sansa speaks softly to Lollys and tries to calm her, but to no avail. Finally, Shae and Falyse grab Lollys by her elbows, and drag her across the bridge. Sansa feels sorry for Lollys, knowing about her rape and pregnancy.
            In the books, Bronn and Lollys get married successfully. In A Feast for Crows, it is reported Lollys gave birth to a boy, strong and healthy, and Bronn named him Tyrion. Jaime finds this amusing, but Cersei is displeased by the sellsword's insolence.
            Lollys's presence at the Riot of King's Landing, her rape in the riot, and her subsequent pregnancy, were all omitted from the TV series continuity. She is furthermore portrayed as being in better physical and mental condition, although she is implied to be a bit dim.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lollys_Stokeworth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemLollysStokeworth</string></dict>
        <key>Leaf</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.84.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Leaf was a member of the non-human race known as the Children of the Forest. She and her kin are responsible for the creation of the first White Walkers, thousands of years ago.
            When Bran Stark and his companions are attacked by wights as they approach the heart tree beyond the Wall that they have been searching for, they are saved by Leaf, who uses powerful magic in the form of explosive long-range fireballs to destroy the wights. During the attack, Leaf tells Meera Reed to leave her wounded brother, Jojen, to die, or else die with him. Leaf then uses her magic to destroy Jojen's body to prevent him from being reanimated as a wight. Leaf then tells the group to follow her into the cave at the base of the heart tree, explaining that the wights cannot follow them into the cave. As the group runs into the cave, Leaf tells them that she is one of the Children, before leading the group deep into the cave to finally meet the Three-Eyed Raven.[1]
            Leaf sits nearby as Meera despondently regards the lands outside the cave. When Meera rejects Bran's friendly overtures, Leaf tells Meera that her destiny is not over, as Bran still cannot defend himself in the real world and he will need Meera's help when he is ready to use his abilities outside the cave.[2]
            Leaf is present when the Three-Eyed Raven pulls Bran out of his vision of the Showdown at the Red Mountains. She appears concerned by the resulting argument between the Three-Eyed Raven and Bran.[3]
            Bran has a vision of Leaf thousands of years in the past, in which she uses an obsidian dagger to convert a restrained man into the first White Walker. Upon waking up, he immediately confronts Leaf about the vision. Anticipating such a reaction, Leaf says that the Children of the Forest were at war, being slaughtered, their sacred trees cut down. She confirms that it was men with whom the Children were at war.
            Later, Leaf prepares the cave's defenses when Bran moves too quickly and attracts the attention of the Night King. She and the other Children fight wights with fire and the White Walkers with dragonglass, but her compatriots are killed one by one. Leaf flees with Meera, Hodor and Bran, but eventually sacrifices herself to give them more time to escape. After being stabbed multiple times by the wights, she activates another explosive device, setting a small section of the wights aflame, but also killing herself in the process.[4]
            *Bran's vision
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Leaf is a Child of the Forest in service to the Three-Eyed Raven (though in the novels, he is called the three-eyed crow). She is described as having nut-brown skin that is dappled like a deer's with paler spots, large ears, large liquid gold and green eyes which are slit like a cat's eyes. Her hair is a tangle of brown, red and gold, autumn colors, with vines and twigs and withered flowers woven through it. She wears a cloak of leaves. Bran thinks that from far away Leaf looks no older than himself or one of his sisters, but close at hand she seems far older. She has a woman’s voice, high and sweet, with a strange music in it like none Bran has ever heard, and a deep sadness.
            Her true name is unknown: it is in the True Tongue of the Children, thus it is very long and also possibly unpronounceable by humans. "Leaf" is a moniker given to her by Bran.
            Leaf says that she was born during "the time of the dragon", apparently meaning at some point after Aegon I Targaryen conquered and united the Seven Kingdoms 300 years ago. She is at least two centuries old because she also says that she secretly walked the world of men for 200 years observing them from the forests before growing weary and deciding to return home to the hidden cave beyond the Wall. This part of her backstory is omitted from the series, which implies that Leaf in fact assisted in the creation of the first White Walkers thousands of years ago, unless Kae Alexander is playing a different Child of the Forest.
            The novels have never described the Children of the Forest casting fireballs the way that Leaf seems to in the Season 4 finale - though in the scene, Leaf might be throwing some kind of volatile object at the wights (the camera doesn't focus on her hand). In the book version of the scene, Leaf lights the wights on fire using a torch, by darting around and between them with amazing speed and agility. In Season 6, these fireballs are confirmed to be some sort of volatile projectile, although their exact functioning (presumably some combination of magic and alchemy) is not revealed.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Leaf</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemLeaf</string></dict>
        <key>Lysa Arryn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.85.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lady Lysa Arryn, née Tully, was born into House Tully as the daughter of Hoster Tully, the Lord Paramount of the Trident, and sister of Catelyn and Edmure Tully. She married into House Arryn through her marriage to Jon Arryn. After Jon's death, whom she had secretly murdered on behalf of Petyr Baelish, her true lover and later second husband, she became the Lady Regent of the Vale, ruling on behalf of her young son, Robin Arryn. She doted on her son and pursued a policy of isolationism during the War of the Five Kings despite her blood ties to House Stark.
            Lysa was born into House Tully and was the second child of Lord Hoster Tully. She had an older sister, Catelyn, and a younger brother, Edmure. Petyr Baelish was fostered with the Tullys and Lysa grew up with him.[1]
            Lysa married Jon Arryn during Robert's Rebellion. Lord Jon was the head of House Arryn and a leader of the rebel faction fighting to overthrow the Mad King. The rebels forged an alliance with House Tully through marriage, with Lord Eddard Stark married to Catelyn and the then-elderly Jon to the still young Lysa.[2][3]
            After the rebel victory in the war, Robert Baratheon became King and appointed Jon as his Hand. Jon served the realm well for many years as Hand of the King. Lysa and Jon have a single son, Robin Arryn, whom she dotes on constantly.[1] Lysa and Jon spent the next seventeen years in the capital of King's Landing, never returning to the Eyrie in the Vale of Arryn.[4]
            Jon died shortly before the events of the series, sparking King Robert's search for a replacement. Lysa fled King's Landing for the safety of the Eyrie with Robin, then six-years old.[2] Though Robin became the titular Lord Paramount of the Vale after his father's death, his mother in fact assumed rulership as the Lady Regent of the Vale until her son came of age. She is considered mentally unstable by Tyrion Lannister.
            Lysa's husband Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, dies of an apparent fever. Lysa flees the capital and returns to the Eyrie with her son Robin. She sends her sister Catelyn a letter claiming that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn for unknown reasons. This news convinces Catelyn's husband, Lord Eddard Stark, that he must accept King Robert's offer to become the new Hand so he may investigate further. During the king's visit to Winterfell, Catelyn's own son Bran Stark is injured in suspicious circumstances.[2]
            Catelyn apprehends Tyrion Lannister on suspicion of trying to kill Bran. She brings him to the Eyrie to be questioned. Lysa is furious with Catelyn for exposing her to the wrath of House Lannister. She and Robin hold Tyrion in contempt, ignoring his threats that his house will repay them for any harm they visit upon him. Lysa orders Tyrion sent to Mord, the castle jailer. Tyrion and Catelyn are both disturbed by Lysa's excessive coddling of Robin, including still breast-feeding him despite him being too old for it.[5]
            Tyrion convinces Lysa to give him a trial, only to protest his innocence. He demands the right of trial by combat, supported by the mercenary Bronn. Bronn wins the battle, killing Lysa's champion, Ser Vardis Egen. Lysa chides Bronn for not fighting with honor, but reluctantly releases Tyrion.[6]
            Lysa receives a letter from King's Landing announcing that Robert has died and Eddard has been arrested as a traitor. She delays showing the letter to Catelyn, to Catelyn's great annoyance. Catelyn asks that the knights of the Vale join House Tully and House Stark in fighting the Lannisters for his freedom, but Lysa refuses. Lysa insists that the Vale knights must remain at home to defend Robin. Catelyn leaves, frustrated and annoyed.[7]
            Lysa remains in the Eyrie, and does not attend her father's funeral. Despite the Vale's neutrality, Tywin Lannister arranges a marriage alliance between Lysa and Petyr Baelish to fight the rest of her family.
            Petyr Baelish, acting under his own promises to both Lysa and her niece Sansa Stark, arrives at the Vale, bringing Sansa to the Eyrie with him. Lysa greets her enthusiastically, introducing Sansa to her cousin, Robin. She conveys her pity for Sansa's unfortunate marriage with the dwarf Tyrion Lannister, and asks if he ever forced himself on her, to which she replies "no". Lysa agrees not to refer to Sansa by her true name in the presence of anyone else, and has Robin show her around the castle. Once they leave, Lysa confesses poisoning her own husband's wine and framing the Lannisters, using these actions as proof of her love for Petyr. Sexually eager, Lysa has her and Littlefinger wed immediately, promising to scream loudly as he makes love to her. That night, she keeps her word, to Sansa's annoyance.[8]
            The following day, Lysa dotes over Sansa in petty conversation, and she shares her childhood memories about Catelyn. However, she grows angry when Sansa almost mentions Littlefinger's love-triangle with Catelyn, something which has irked Lysa for years. She starts grilling Sansa, wondering why Littlefinger cares so much for her, and if he has ever forced himself onto her. Sansa is shocked and denies this, and complains that Lysa, clenching her fingers tightly, is hurting her. Seeing Sansa scared, Lysa returns to a nurturing state, drawing her close and comforting her.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lysa_Arryn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemLysaArryn</string></dict>
        <key>Lynesse Hightower</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.86.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lady Lynesse Hightower is the former wife of Ser Jorah Mormont, the former Lord of Bear Island, and a member of House Hightower of Oldtown. She is the younger sister of Alerie Tyrell, the wife of Lord Mace Tyrell, head of House Tyrell.
            When Daenerys Targaryen asks Ser Jorah Mormont the reason he had sold poachers into slavery, he mentions Lynesse and her expensive tastes, which he always sought to please, leading to his ruin. Then Daenerys asks where is she now and he answers that she's in another place with another man.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lynesse is described as extremely beautiful with blonde hair and pale skin. Jorah Mormont says she looked a bit like Daenerys Targaryen. Lynesse married Jorah after he won a tournament to celebrate the victory of King Robert against the Greyjoy Rebellion, in which Jorah wore her favor. Lynesse was used to the riches and luxury of Oldtown and found Bear Island primitive and crude. Jorah's attempts to please his wife led to him spending all of his money. He disgraced himself through behavior unbefitting a lord, by arresting poachers and selling them to slavers. Slavery is illegal in the Seven Kingdoms and has been for millennia. When Eddard Stark came to arrest Jorah, he and Lynesse fled across the Narrow Sea to the Free City of Lys, leaving his aunt Maege to become the ruling Lady of Bear Island. Jorah attempted to make his living as a sellsword, but was unable to provide an income acceptable to Lynesse. She left him and became a concubine to the merchant-lord Tregar Ormollen.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lynesse_Hightower</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemLynesseHightower</string></dict>
        <key>Tyrell lady</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.87.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>A lady of House Tyrell is apparently a granddaughter of Olenna Tyrell, one of Queen Margaery's cousins from a lesser branch of House Tyrell, and her handmaiden. Her fate following the downfall of her family is uncertain, but most likely, she would have attended the trial in the Great Sept since she was a handmaid to Margaery.
            She is apparently a granddaughter of Olenna Tyrell, one of Margaery's cousins from a lesser branch of House Tyrell.
            She is seated in the gardens of King's Landing with her grandmother, Lady Olenna Tyrell and another girl embroidering a golden Tyrell rose with their motto, "Growing Strong", which prompts Olenna to criticize her embroidery before complaining about House Tyrell's "dull" words, comparing them to that of House Stark and House Greyjoy, before observing that there is "a spider in the garden". When Varys approaches, Olenna shoos them away with the mocking advice to "grow strong".[1]
            Ser Loras Tyrell, his father Mace Tyrell, and his sister, Queen Margaery Tyrell, attend his trial at the Great Sept of Baelor. They eventually discover that they have been caught in a trap set up by Cersei Lannister, shortly before the Great Sept burns to the ground with wildfire, immediately killing everyone present, including Margaery and, presumably, her handmaidens, who were likely with her. This single act ends up almost entirely wiping out House Tyrell, which prompts a broken Lady Olenna to state that Cersei destroyed "her future". This likely indicates that all of Olenna's descendants and the distant relatives of House Tyrell would have been in the sept when it was destroyed and perished along with Margaery.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Margaery Tyrell arrives in King's Landing to wed King Joffrey Baratheon accompanied by three handmaidens, Elinor Tyrell, Megga Tyrell, and Alla Tyrell. The girls are all daughters of different cadet branches of House Tyrell. Elinor Tyrell is the only one of the three to have reached puberty. Both of the ladies seen in "And Now His Watch is Ended", as well as the two attending Lady Margaery in "Valar Dohaeris" are obviously adults, so that particular detail appears to have been ignored. Their relationship to Margaery might be the same, however, since these two refer to Olenna as "nana", this presumably means she is their grandmother - or at least, a relative close enough to think she can use the term. In the books, Olenna only has one other granddaughter beside Margaery: Desmera Redwyne, the daughter of Mina Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne (Olenna's daughter and first cousin respectively).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrell_lady</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemTyrelllady</string></dict>
        <key>Lyanna Mormont</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.88.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lady Lyanna Mormont is the young Lady of Bear Island and thus the head of House Mormont of Bear Island ever since the death of her mother, Maege Mormont. She is the niece of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont of the Night's Watch and the first cousin of Ser Jorah Mormont. She pledges House Mormont's forces to House Stark upon meeting Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, and Davos Seaworth, making her house one of the few loyalists alongside House Hornwood and House Mazin. After House Bolton is defeated at the Battle of the Bastards, she is the first to declare Jon Snow the King in the North during a gathering of the Northern lords at Winterfell.
            Lyanna Mormont is the daughter of Maege Mormont. She was named for Lyanna Stark, who died years before she was born. After her mother's older brother Jeor joined the Night's Watch and his only son Jorah exiled to Essos, Maege Mormont became Lady of Bear Island. When Maege left to fight in the War of the Five Kings, Lyanna ruled Bear Island in her mother's stead, eventually taking Maege's place upon her death in combat.[1]
            House Mormont's domains are poor on their heavily forested island, vulnerable to attack from the sea, meaning that the Mormonts have had to develop a strong tradition of warrior women to defend their homes from surprise raids. Maege Mormont personally led and fought beside the Mormont contingent in Robb Stark's army. Maege's daughter Lyanna was similarly raised, expecting to be a ruler and commander - unlike many other Houses, even in the North, that usually do not allow women to rule.
            Along with the other Stark vassals of the North, House Mormont's army was slaughtered at the Red Wedding, leaving their home garrison with only sixty two remaining warriors - led by a ten year old Lyanna, because most of their people of fighting age had been killed.[1]
            Stannis Baratheon has come to Castle Black and sent ravens to all the noble houses of the North with messages demanding them to join his cause. Lyanna Mormont sends back a rebuff that she and Bear Island know no other king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark. An irate Stannis shows the message to Jon Snow, who smiles briefly and points out that, much like the Free Folk, the Northmen are loyal to their own.[2]
            Lyanna is one of the Northern leaders being visited by Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, and Davos Seaworth, who are attempting to rally the North against House Bolton who currently occupies Winterfell. Sansa and Jon try to flatter her, but Lyanna brusquely brushes them off, demands to know why they are at Bear Island, and questions whether Jon and Sansa are technically even Starks, the former being a bastard, and the latter being twice married into enemy houses. She refuses to offer her men to them until Davos steps in. He tells her that the real war is not between different houses, but between the living and the dead; a divided North cannot hope to stand against the Night King. After some reflection, Lady Mormont agrees to help, but can only offer sixty-two fighting men, though she insists that the hardy warriors of Bear Island are worth many times their own number in battle. She personally leads these men when Jon travels to Stannis's old camp.[1]
            Lyanna is among those present at Winterfell after the battle. As the knights of the Vale, the many Northern lords, and the Free Folk bicker, she stands in the assembly and calls out the Manderlys, Glovers, and Cerwyns for refusing Jon and Sansa's call to arms. She then declares that she doesn't care if Jon is a bastard, because Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins. She is the first to proclaim Jon the new King in the North, and is quickly followed by the others.[4]
            Lady Lyanna is present at a meeting of Jon Snow's allied forces. When Lord Robett Glover protests at the King in the North's orders that everyone over the age of 10 be trained for combat, regardless of gender, Lyanna counters that she will train all on Bear Island against the coming White Walkers, famously stating that she does not intend to sit by her fire knitting while men fight to defend her. Lord Glover, not to be outdone by an 11-year old, withdraws his complaint.[5]
            When Jon is called to Dragonstone by Daenerys Targaryen, regarding an alliance, Lyanna states that with winter here, the North needs their King with them. As recompense, Jon leaves Sansa in control of the North, as he departs with Davos.[6]
            Despite her young age, Lyanna is shown to be a competent, effective, and intelligent leader, in sharp contrast to the psychopathic Joffrey, timid Tommen, and developmentally challenged Robin Arryn. While she emanates self-confidence, she does not hesitate to consult her advisors if she sees the need. At the same time, she is not overly-reliant on her advisors, and will wave aside her maester if she has reached a firm decision already. As a female and the only living heir of a major Northern house, Lyanna challenges and strives to live up to the expectations placed upon her, and behaves in a stern, no-nonsense manner when negotiating with other houses. She is extremely proud of her house, and she is devoted to protecting Bear Island's people, indicating that she views this responsibility with the utmost solemnity. Though Lyanna shares her family's fierce loyalty to House Stark, she was initially reluctant to help Jon and Sansa fight the Boltons until Ser Davos convinced her, comparing their recent rises to power and informing her of the greater threat beyond the Wall.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lyanna_Mormont</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemLyannaMormont</string></dict>

            Lhara is a prostitute living in Braavos.
            She is at a bathhouse with Salladhor Saan and another prostitute when Davos Seaworth interrupts them and recruits Salladhor.[1]
            Lhara is said to be a regular customer of "Lanna" a young shellfish monger who roams the working class sections of Braavos each morning. Lhara has a liking for the oysters Lanna sells, and buys some on her way home from work each morning; although it is the end of Lhara's working day, it is the beginning of Lanna's and Lhara is one of her first customers.[2]
            When Lanna enters the brothel, Brusco tries to kick her out, but Lhara convinces him to let the girl stay as she is hungry for oysters. Lhara convinces her client to shell out for the snack by saying oysters are said to "get the juices flowing".[3]

        <key>Quaithe</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.90.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Quaithe, sometimes called Quaithe of the Shadow, is a mysterious woman encountered by Jorah Mormont in Qarth. Like Melisandre, Quaithe is a shadowbinder from the fabled city of Asshai in the far east of Essos, and seems to wield magical powers of prophecy and clairvoyance.
            Quaithe is a mysterious woman hailing from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai in the far east.
            Quaithe is present in Qarth after the arrival of Daenerys Targaryen and her khalasar. After the young Khaleesi witnesses a feat of magic performed by the warlock Pyat Pree and is taken away by Xaro Xhoan Daxos, Quaithe approaches Ser Jorah Mormont and warns him of the men that might covet Daenerys's dragons.[1]
            Following the theft of the dragons Ser Jorah seeks out Quaithe. He finds her painting a sailor to protect him while passing across the shattered Valyrian Peninsula, where the Doom is said to still hold sway. She tells Jorah that Daenerys is with the person that stole her dragons while she is meeting with The Thirteen. During the meeting Pyat Pree reveals himself as the thief. He pronounces Xaro the King of Qarth and murders the other members of the council using his magic before repeating an invitation to visit the House of the Undying.[2]
            According to costume designer Michele Clapton, Quaithe's mask was designed to display a stylistic link to Melisandre, because both of them are from the region of Asshai. Melisandre wears an ornate neck piece featuring a repeated design motif of elongated hexagons. Quaithe's mask was constructed using the same hexagonal shapes as links, though filled in with metal. Further, the dresses of both Melisandre and Quaithe have the same hexagonal design motif (elongated so they are taller than they are wide), though the pattern on Melisandre's dress is solid red on black and more difficult to see.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Quaithe is an enigmatic shadowbinder, preferring to speak in riddles and prophecies. She hides her true features behind a dark red, lacquered mask of wood, as do many people from the Shadow Lands.
            In the books, Quaithe first meets Daenerys in the Red Waste. When Daenerys' scout Jhogo returns from Qarth, Quaithe, Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Pyat Pree accompany him to meet Daenerys, and invite her to the city. Quaithe then continues with Daenerys' group to Qarth itself. The TV series simplifies this so Daenerys simply meets Quaithe when she actually arrives at Qarth. Daenerys encounters Quaithe several more times during her stay in Qarth, during which the shadowbinder explains that magic has made an unexpected return in the weeks since the dragons' birth. Quaithe also urges Daenerys to leave Qarth as soon as possible and visit Asshai, saying cryptically: "To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow". Daenerys is reluctant to trust her, however, recalling her unpleasant experience with Mirri Maz Duur.
            When Daenerys is in Astapor, Quaithe appears in her cabin seemingly in a dream, repeats her mysterious words, then disappears.
            In "A Dance with Dragons", Quaithe appears once more before Daenerys, delivering another cryptic warning: "The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame,  lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal". Some of the items in the warning have already been revealed to the readers:
            In the end of the fifth novel, Daenerys is wandering lost, starving, and alone in the Dothraki Sea. She slips into a restless sleep and hears Quaithe's original instructions again. She then sees Quaithe, whose mask is made of starlight, and the stars whisper in a woman's voice: "Remember who you are, Daenerys. The dragons know. Do you?".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Quaithe</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemQuaithe</string></dict>

She allegedly lived not long after the creation of the Night's Watch, some 8,000 years ago.
            According to legend, a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch found in the Haunted Forest a cold woman with bright blue eyes, seemingly a female White Walker. He took her to the other side of the Wall and declared himself "Night's King". For thirteen years the two ruled over the brothers of the Night's Watch, performing human sacrifices. The Free Folk rallied under the banner of a King-Beyond-the-Wall, Joramun, and marched against the Nightfort, which the Night's King had taken as his seat, defeating him and his queen with the aid of House Stark.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Night's King fell in love with a woman "with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars"; he loved her though "her skin was cold as ice", and when he gave his seed to her he gave her his soul as well. He brought her to the Nightfort and bound the brothers of the Night's Watch to his will through sorcery. He declared himself "Night's King" and ruled over the Wall and The Gift as his own. The King in the North Brandon the Breaker and Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined forces to defeat him and his queen.
            After their deaths, it was discovered that they had been making human sacrifices to the Others - the White Walkers.
            After their defeat, the rule was enforced that the castles of the Night's Watch along the Wall should never be fortified against approach from the south, so that they cannot oppose the lands south of the Wall which they are meant to defend. The downfall of the Night's King and Queen also resulted in the strict enforcement of the rule that the Night's Watch is meant to be politically neutral, as guardians who do not "rule" the Wall but who serve the realms of men.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s_Queen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemNight'sQueen</string></dict>
        <key>Clea</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.92.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Clea is a prostitute and a slave.
            Clea was a slave and at some point she was made a bedslave at a brothel in the Long Bridge of Volantis. Like all bedslaves in Volantis, she was branded with a slave tattoo shaped like a tear on her cheek. She speaks the Common Tongue.
            Tyrion Lannister approaches her at a brothel and they take an interest in each other. Despite the fact that he has no money, she offers to have sex with him. He however finds himself unable to perform, thinking of Shae.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character by the name of Clea.
            Tyrion does encounter a Westerosi-looking prostitute in Selhorys, a town under Volantene rule. Her real name is unknown; the propertier refers to her as "sunset girl". Contrary to the scene depicted in the TV series, however, Tyrion does not befriend her but does have sex with her, noticing that she just lies there, unmoving. Her back is severely scarred and her eyes look dead, indicating she was forced to become a prostitute. Too drunk to care, Tyrion retches on the carpet and has sex with her again, then leaving ashamed with himself.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Clea</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemClea</string></dict>
        <key>Kinvara</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.93.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kinvara is a Red Priestess, one of the high-ranking leaders in the faith of R'hllor, the Lord of Light.
            Her full title is "High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, and First Servant of the Lord of Light".[1]
            Kinvara meets with Tyrion Lannister and Varys in the Great Pyramid of Meereen, as Tyrion plans to ask her assistance in convincing the people to follow Daenerys as their guardian and protector rather than a conqueror or an invader. Tyrion greets her in Valyrian but she stays silent until she states, in the Common Tongue, that he does not need to persuade her into helping. Kinvara is sure that Daenerys is the one who was promised, using her freeing of the slaves and her dragons as examples of her claim; Kinvara is thus happy to assist Daenerys's associates however she can. Before she and Tyrion can complete their agreement, Varys interrupts, pointing out that Melisandre had proclaimed Stannis Baratheon to be the one who was promised, and that he was defeated by Tyrion in the Battle of Blackwater and later at Winterfell, the second time for good. He complains about how religion is overly self-assured of its own tenets; how everything is the "will of the Lord", and asks Kinvara why he should believe in her words when another Red Priestess was wrong. Kinvara states that everything is the will of the Lord, but that men and women can make mistakes. She asks him if he remembers what the voice in the flames said when the "second rate sorcerer" threw his man parts into the fire, or if he knows who was speaking on the other side, rendering Varys speechless. She asks if he needs her to speak the very same words, or to identify the speaker; Varys cannot bring himself to answer. As Kinvara turns to leave, she assures Tyrion that she will call on her best priests and preachers to speak about the Queen through all of Essos.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the High Priest of Volantis is a man named Benerro. He openly supports Daenerys, claiming in his preachings that her coming is the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy; that she was born from smoke and salt to make the world anew; the dragons have come to carry her to glory; and she is Azor Ahai. He demands that the Volantenes take sides with her against the Wise Masters and their allies. He claims that "Daenerys stands in peril. The dark eye has fallen upon her, and the minions of night are plotting her destruction". Meanwhile, the Volantene slavemaster noblemen hate Daenerys for her abolition of slavery in Slaver's Bay, and send a large fleet to reinforce Yunkai. The Triarch Malaquo Maegyr wishes to silence Benerro, but does not dare use the city guard because half of them are followers of R'hllor.
            It is unclear in the books if there is one ruler or ruling body for the entire Lord of Light religion, similar to the High Septon or council of the Most Devout in the Faith of the Seven. There can be a single "high priest" (or priestess) for an entire major city-state such as Volantis, but how they coordinate with each other is unknown. Therefore, it is unclear whether Benerro (Kinvara in the show) is "a leader" in the Lord of Light church or "the leader".
            Instead of going to Meereen himself to preach the message that Daenerys is the Lord's chosen, the High Priest sends one of his red priests, Moqorro. He travels in the same ship that carries Tyrion and Jorah. Like Kinvara, he sees things in the flames that he couldn't know otherwise: Moqorro tells Tyrion he saw Daenerys, and Tyrion as well, "a small man with a big shadow", though Tyrion is skeptical. Moqorro also tells Tyrion about "a tall and twisted thing with one black eye and ten long arms, sailing on a sea of blood" who seeks Daenerys more than anyone else. This mysterious figure is widely speculated to be Euron Greyjoy, since in the books he has one eye, Krakens (depicted in the Greyjoy sigil) have ten arms, and indeed he has embarked on a quest to seek Daenerys.
            Moqorro has a very frightening appearance: he is huge man, taller than Jorah and wide enough to make two of him, with a belly like a boulder; his skin is black as pitch, his hair as white as snow which grows about his face like a lion’s mane; he has the flames tattooed across his cheeks and brow yellow and orange. He wears scarlet robes embroidered at sleeve and hem and collar with orange satin flames, and holds an iron staff as tall as him, crowned with a dragon’s head; when he stamps the staff butt upon the deck, the dragon’s maw spits crackling green flame. He has healing and prophecy abilities. He has nerves of steel, does not get scared easily, even if he is surrounded by people who intend to kill him.
            Moqorro's ship is badly damaged in a storm, and he is swept overboard. After being adrift for several days, Moqorro is rescued by Victarion Greyjoy, who was sent to Meereen by Euron to propose to Daenerys in his name, though in fact Victarion intends to steal Euron's plan and marry her himself. Though the ironborn are initially hostile to this priest of a foreign deity, Victarion grows to trust Moqorro, since he heals Victarion and his visions prove to be correct.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Kinvara</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemKinvara</string></dict>
        <key>Kitty Frey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.94.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kitty Frey is the ninth wife of Lord Walder Frey.[1]
            After the death of his eighth wife Joyeuse Erenford at the Red Wedding, Walder Frey takes the young Kitty to wife. At the Red Wedding, Walder coldly refused to spare Robb Stark's life in exchange for Joyeuse, telling Catelyn Stark, who ultimately killed Joyeuse in response to Robb's death at the hands of Roose Bolton, he would find another.[2]
            Kitty nervously stands by his side as Walder angrily berates his sons Lothar Frey and Black Walder for allowing Catelyn's uncle Brynden Tully to retake Riverrun. As his sons report to their father of the various threats to their hold on the Riverlands, Walder slaps Kitty on the rear and shouts that if he wants excuses, he would put her in charge. As he tells his sons what to do about the Blackfish, he pulls Kitty on to his lap and holds her close, making her visibly uncomfortable.[3]
            As Walder addresses his assembled kin in the Freys' hall, Kitty stands by his side. While preparing a toast, he brings out new wine, but stops Kitty when she tries to drink. Soon all the Frey men begin to choke and bleed as Kitty and other women look in horror. Walder is then revealed to be Arya Stark as she pulls off a mask. She leaves a message with Kitty, saying to tell the others that the North remembers and winter has come before walking out of the hall.[4]
            Walder Frey’s eighth wife, the teenaged Joyeuse Erenford, died at the Red Wedding in the TV version but not in the books. Therefore, Kitty, who he got to replace her is an invention of the TV series.
            In the books, Catelyn’s last desperate act was to hold one of Walder’s lackwit (mentally disabled) grandsons hostage with a knife to his throat, but Walder bluntly said she could go ahead and kill him because he wasn’t of much use (displaying that he hypocritically doesn’t really value his own family members). Rather than introduce too many new characters, the TV version just streamlined this so Catelyn grabbed his wife Lady Joyeuse instead, and ultimately killed her as Walder said she was replaceable.
            Thus, TV-Joyeuse's replacement appears in Season 6.
            Her name wasn't stated in dialogue but was given as "Kitty Frey" in the Season 6 HBO Viewer's Guide website. Her background, however, is unknown, such as what her maiden name was.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Kitty_Frey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemKittyFrey</string></dict>
        <key>Karsi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.95.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Karsi was a spearwife and wildling leader, among those who retreated to Hardhome after the wildlings' defeat at the Battle of Castle Black.
            Karsi is a spearwife and wildling leader, among those who retreated to Hardhome after the wildlings' defeat at the Battle of Castle Black. She lost her father, her uncle, and two brothers fighting the Night's Watch.
            When Lord Commander Jon Snow and Tormund arrive at Hardhome to offer the Free Folk to retreat to Castle Black and settle south of the Wall, a meeting of the clan chieftains is held, where Karsi represents her clan. The Lord Commander appeals to their shared purpose against the White Walkers and offers them a cache of dragonglass as a weapon against the White Walkers. Magnar Loboda dismisses this as just as unlikely as the mythical "ice spiders as big as hounds". Karsi asks how, with everything they have seen, Loboda can still call this unbelievable. She decides to side with the Lord Commander's plan as long as Tormund vouches for him, but Loboda remains stubborn. He claims that all the Free Folk who get on the Crows' boats will be executed, as they have always been enemies. When he says his ancestors would spit on him if he broke bread with a crow, Karsi retorts that her ancestors would too, but since they are all dead, it doesn't matter. Nevertheless, Loboda abandons the hall and is followed by many other chieftains. As Jon, Tormund, and Karsi stand in dismay, she mutters, "I fucking hate Thenns!"
            When Lord Commander Jon Snow and Tormund arrive to retrieve the wildlings to escape the imminent invasion of the White Walkers, Karsi initially is hostile towards Jon, but after listening to him and Tormund, she agrees to their plan and begins boarding her people into longboats.
            They begin boarding the wildlings into the longboats, and Karsi puts her daughters in one of them, telling her youngest that her older sister Johnna is in charge until she comes back. The girl protests, but Karsi says she needs to be there to get the old people on the boats, and promises to be just behind them. Then, the White Walkers attack with their Army of the Dead, and Karsi joins the defense of Hardhome while buying time for the rest of the Free Folk to board the boats bound for Castle Black. During the Massacre at Hardhome, Karsi manages to kill several wights while defending the remnants of the Free Folk. Jon Snow tries to convince her to board the boats, but Karsi argues he should go instead, as she doesn't believe the Night's Watch men at Castle Black will let her daughters and the rest of the wildlings through the Wall if Jon Snow is not there. During the fighting, Karsi is confronted by child wights and freezes in shock. Unable to bring herself to kill children, she is overwhelmed. A moment later, she becomes part of their army raised by the Night King.[1]
            While Bran Stark is on the run from the undead army of the Night King, Karsi is briefly shown as a wight in one of his visions.[2]
            * Bran's vision (archive footage, no credit, no lines)
            The HBO Viewer's Guide identifies Karsi as a chieftain of the Ice-river clans, but this may be an error, for two reasons. First, the Ice-river clans in the novels are savage cannibals, considered half-feral even by the other wildlings - though the TV series also made changes like this before, such as how they made the Thenns fierce cannibals, when in the novels they are actually the most culturally sophisticated of the wildlings, even forging their own bronze weapons (the TV version of the Thenns are basically a condensation of the Thenns with the Ice-River clans).
            Second, the ice-rivers that the clans come from are actually deep in the interior of the lands beyond the Wall, far away from the coasts. Their lands are so far north that little grows, which is why they actively hunt other wildlings for their meat. Karsi and her followers, however, are visibly decorated with seashells, and costume designer Michele Clapton said that this is to indicate wildlings that live near the coasts, hinting that Karsi may be of the Frozen Shore. There is no clear explanation for the discrepancy - so far it was only mentioned exactly once in the Viewer's Guide entry for Karsi, but not in the episode itself.
            Speaking in an interview with The New York Times, actress Birgitte Hjort Sørensen responded to a comment about how "maternal" Karsi was to her children, by saying how delighted she was that her character wasn't written in a patronizing way or downplayed as a leader because she was female:
            As it turns out, however, director Miguel Sapochnik explained in a separate interview with MTV.com that the reason for this is that Karsi was originally written to be a man, and only recast with a female actress late in production:
            In the novels, one of Tormund's sons died and was later raised as a wight, and he actually killed the wight himself. Regardless of being a man, Tormund was still distraught about it as a father:
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there are several female chieftains and raiders among the Free Folk. One of the most prominent is Morna White Mask, a warrior and woods witch dubbed "White Mask" for the weirwood mask she wears. When Tormund convinces prominent wildling leaders to join forces with the Night's Watch and be accepted at the other side of the Wall, Morna offers Jon Snow to be his man or woman, whatever he desires. She lifts her mask just briefly enough to kneel and kiss his hand as a sign of fealty.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Karsi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemKarsi</string></dict>

            Cassana was born to House Estermont, a noble house from the Stormlands. She became the Lady of Storm's End and the wife of Lord Steffon Baratheon, the head of House Baratheon, one of the Great Houses of Westeros. They had three sons, Robert, Stannis and Renly Baratheon. She lived with her family in Storm's End. After Robert's Rebellion, her eldest son assumed the Iron Throne on the grounds that he had the best claim out of all the rebel leaders because Cassana had Targaryen blood.[1]
            She has an entry in the The Lineage and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, as read by Eddard Stark.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cassana comes from House Estermont. She married Steffon Baratheon and bore him three sons as in the series. She accompanied him on a trip to Essos. Their ship, the Windproud, sank in Shipbreaker Bay within sight of Storm's End on their return voyage.

            Kayla is a prostitute and a highly skilled contortionist. She is one of only four women in the known world who can bend her body to the extent that she can properly perform a sexual position known as the "Meereenese Knot".
            Along with Marei and Genna, she is one of the three prostitutes in Littlefinger's brothel who are hired by Tyrion Lannister to service Podrick Payne as a reward for saving his life in the Battle of the Blackwater.[1] Kayla and her colleagues are apparently so satisfied with Podrick that they decline payment, much to the astonishment of Tyrion, Bronn, Ros, and even Varys.[2]
            Kayla is present as an entertainer at the wedding feast between King Joffrey Baratheon and Lady Margaery Tyrell. Her performance is admired by Oberyn Martell and Ellaria Sand.[3]
            The actress who plays Kayla, Pixie Le Knot, is a professional contortionist.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character named Kayla. The "Meereenese Knot" is an inside joke to the books fandom about a major plot issue George R. R.

        <key>Irri</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.98.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Irri was a young Dothraki woman who is given to Daenerys Targaryen as a Handmaiden, along with Jhiqui and Doreah. She teaches Daenerys the Dothraki language and customs. She swears fealty to Daenerys following the death of Khal Drogo and the birth of the dragons. She is murdered during the theft of the dragons in Qarth.
            Irri is a young Dothraki woman in the Khalasar of Drogo.
            Irri becomes a handmaiden to Daenerys after her marriage to Khal Drogo. She is tasked with teaching Daenerys the Dothraki language and customs.[1] Irri tends to Daenerys while she seeks advice on Dothraki customs and stories, and is sceptical of Doreah's story that dragons come from a long-destroyed second moon.[2]
            Irri acts as a translator between Daenerys and her bodyguard Rakharo. Rakharo protects Daenerys from one of her brother Viserys's famous rages by whipping him around his throat, though he respects Daenerys's request not to kill him. Irri and Rakharo show mutual puzzlement at her mercy. Irri determines that Daenerys is pregnant and arranges a special dinner to celebrate. Irri tells Ser Jorah Mormont about Daenerys's pregnancy as she demands Rakharo to find something different than horseflesh for the meal.[3]
            Irri tends to Doreah after Viserys beats her.[4] Irri burns her hands when she tries to handle a dragon egg Daenerys has put into a fire pit, Daenerys was holding the egg without it affecting her. Irri is present when Viserys threatens Daenerys and her baby and translates his words to Drogo. Irri watches as Viserys is killed by the Khal using molten gold to avoid spilling blood in Vaes Dothrak. Daenerys says that no true dragon could be killed by fire.[5]
            Irri is part of Daenerys's retinue as she inspects the markets of Vaes Dothrak. She is there when a wineseller tries to assassinate Daenerys. Jorah foils the attempt and Rakharo captures the man. Irri watches as Drogo swears to invade the seven kingdoms as revenge for the assassination attempt.[6] Irri accompanies Daenerys to Lhazar when the khalasar raids there to obtain slaves to fund crossing to Westeros. Daenerys objects to the rape of the captives and Irri is present when Drogo kills Mago for questioning Daenerys's authority. Drogo takes a small wound in the duel.[7] She helps Dany to care for Drogo when his wound festers. Daenerys' reliance on the healing of Lhazareen godswife Mirri Maz Duur alienates the Dothraki. Daenerys is attacked and injured by Qotho.[8] Daenerys loses her baby and Drogo is left catatonic when she turns to Maz Duur's blood magic. The khalasar splinters without Drogo and Daenerys smothers him to end his suffering. She builds a funeral pyre for him and stakes Maz Duur within the flames to avenge the loss of her son. Daenerys also puts her eggs within the flames and shocks Irri when she walks in after them. The remains of the khalasar stay around the fire all night. In the morning they find Daenerys alive in the ashes with three dragons. Irri swears fealty to Daenerys along with the rest of her people.[9]
            Irri crosses the Red Waste alongside the rest of Daenerys's khalasar. Daenerys's silver dies during their journey. Daenerys halts the majority of the column and sends her bloodriders to scout ahead.[10]
            Irri is distraught when Rakharo's horse arrives back to the khalasar without him. Jorah Mormont approaches the horse and discovers Rakharo's severed head. She is devastated because, according to Dohtraki belief, unless his body is cremated Rakharo's spirit won't be able to move on to the Night Lands (the afterlife) to ride with his ancestors. Irri is comforted by Daenerys, who tells her that tonight Rakharo will ride with them.[11] Irri was in love with Rakharo.[12]
            Kovarro returns having reached the city of Qarth. Daenerys leads her people there and is dismayed when she is refused entry by the ruling elders the Thirteen. The khalasar are eventually admitted under the protection of Xaro Xhoan Daxos.[13]
            Xaro welcomes Daenerys into his home, giving her people accommodation and buying her gifts. Irri watches as Daenerys and Doreah lean on the stone balcony of their new apartment. Drogon is perched on the edge of the balcony with a lump of raw meat between them. Daenerys instructs Drogon to breathe flame on the meat by saying Dracarys, the old Valyrian word for Dragon fire. Drogon does as she commands, charring the meat. Doreah and Daenerys watch the dragon gleefully as he feasts on the cooked morsel. Daenerys says that Drogon will be able to feed himself from now on. Doreah reaches for another lump of meat but Daenerys instructs her to let Drogon sleep. Doreah holds out her hand to help the dragon back into his wooden cage and he climbs onto it. Daenerys tells Doreah that the dragon loves her, eliciting a frown from Irri.[14]
            Daenerys joins Irri by her bed and Irri describes the repairs she has made to Daenerys’s clothes. Daenerys thanks Irri, calling her friend. Doreah picks up a dress from the bed and asks if Daenerys has seen it. She tells her Xaro had it made for her and reports hearing that he is the wealthiest man in Qarth. Irri concurs with her fellow handmaiden. Doreah adds that Qarth is the richest city in Essos. Daenerys recalls her gift from Illyrio Mopatis, saying that the last time a rich man gave her a gown it was because he intended to sell her into marriage with Khal Drogo. Irri offers a Dothraki prayer for Drogo to ride forever in the night lands. Daenerys tells Doreah that they know nothing about their host and suggests that men often speak about other men when they are happy, suggesting that Doreah seduce some of Xaro’s fellow citizens to obtain more information. Doreah says that Daenerys would look like a real princess in Xaro’s dress and Irri objects to the title, correcting Doreah that Daenerys is a Khaleesi. Irri breaks the ensuing awkward silence by encouraging Daenerys to wear the dress as a guest’s courtesy to Xaro. Xaro throws a reception for Daenerys in his gardens. Irri and several of the khalasar are also present.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Irri</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemIrri</string></dict>
        <key>Ygritte</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.99.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ygritte was a woman of the Free Folk who lived north of the Wall. She was part of Mance Rayder's army and became the lover of Jon Snow.
            Ygritte was a quick-witted and courageous young spearwife. She had red hair and displayed great skill as an archer. Living north of the Wall, she was well skilled in survival and was staunchly loyal to the cause of Mance Rayder. She valued her status as a free woman, and disparaged those living south of the Wall as 'kneelers', who blindly followed hereditary leaders instead of choosing a king.
            Ygritte believed that because wildlings and Northerners both claim descent from the First Men, there is no need for them to be fighting, and that only the geographical divide of the Wall separates them. As with other wildlings, Ygritte understood that the real threat lies with the impending invasion of the White Walkers.[1][2]
            Ygritte was captured by Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand as the sole survivor of their assault on her watchpost. She instructed her captors to burn the bodies of her companions, but Qhorin questioned her motives, thinking that she wanted a fire to attract more wildlings. He then instructs Jon to execute her, telling him to catch up to him after the deed is done. Jon prepares to do so, but cannot bring himself to kill her. Ygritte begs Jon to get it over with and awaits the stroke from his sword, but he hesitates and Ygritte seizes the opportunity to escape. Jon recaptures her, becoming isolated from his brothers in the process. With night approaching, Jon refuses to make a fire, forcing them to sleep out in the cold. Ygritte convinces him to huddle next to her to share body warmth but then makes sexual advances towards him.[3]
            After a cold night, Jon leads Ygritte along as he tries to find Qhorin Halfhand. On the way she argues with Jon, saying that the North belonged to the Free Folk long before the Andals came. Ygritte tells Jon that, as both Northerners and the Free Folk are descendants of the First Men, there is no sense in the two constantly fighting. After luring Jon off his guard by attempting to seduce him, she manages to escape again and lead him into a wildling ambush.[4]
            Ygritte brings Jon to the Lord of Bones, who orders him executed. She convinces Rattleshirt that Mance will want to question Jon because of his Stark blood. The Lord of Bones presents Qhorin, whom he had captured. The Halfhand openly blames Jon for the deaths of his men, and this discord intrigues Ygritte. Unbeknownst to Ygritte, Qhorin's outward rage toward Jon is actually a plan to install Jon as a spy within Mance Rayder's army.[5]
            During their way to meet with Mance Rayder, Ygritte continues to toy with Jon. Qhorin communicates a plan to Jon, through which Jon would appear to desert the Night's Watch and join up with the wildlings. He insists that Jon and he fight and allows Jon to kill him. Ygritte and the rest of the band are stunned, but accept Jon as one of their own and free his hands.[6]
            Ygritte leads Jon Snow into Mance Rayder's camp in the Frostfang Mountains. Jon is shocked to see a giant among the tents. While the group is walking through the camp to Mance Rayder's tent, some young boys pelt Jon with ice and stones, Ygritte protects him and shoos them away. When they arrive inside Mance Rayder's tent, she ensures his safety and adoption as one of the Free Folk.[7]
            Ygritte later travels with Jon and Mance as they march slowly south towards the wall. They encounter one of his scouts, Orell. Ygritte is surprised to find that Jon has never seen a warg before.[8]
            Some time later, as the wildlings ready to climb the wall, Ygritte reveals she is aware that Jon is still loyal to the Night's Watch. She understands that he is an honorable man, but warns him that he has obligations to her as well. While climbing, Ygritte causes a massive crack, which dislodges a large sheet of ice and sends several wildlings to their deaths. She and Jon are left hanging by their safety rope. Orell decides that Tormund cannot continue climbing with the weight of Jon and Ygritte's bodies pulling them down, and begins cutting the rope. Jon barely manages to get a hold in the Wall and saves himself and Ygritte when their rope is severed. They reach the top of the Wall and share a passionate kiss, grateful to be alive after such a narrow escape.[11]
            Ygritte, Jon Snow and the wildlings led by Tormund Giantsbane then make their way towards Castle Black to await Mance Rayder's signal to begin the attack on the Night's Watch.[12] Along the way, Ygritte is confronted by Orell, who expresses his distrust of Jon and says he would make a much better husband. However, he is flatly refused. Later, Jon tries to persuade Ygritte that the wildlings' cause is doomed to failure, but she refuses to listen. She tells him that if they die, they die, but before that, they will live. The two kiss passionately.[12]
            Later, the wildling party prepares to raid an elderly horse breeder's home. When the party attacks the farmstead, Jon surreptitiously hits a rock with his sword, alerting the old man and giving him the chance to escape. When Ygritte tries to shoot the fleeing man with an arrow, Jon causes her to miss.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ygritte</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemYgritte</string></dict>
        <key>Joyeuse Frey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.100.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Joyeuse Frey, née Erenford, was the eighth wife of Lord Walder Frey, the Lord of the Crossing.
            Joyeuse Erenford was 15 years old and the eighth wife of Lord Walder Frey, the Lord of the Crossing.[1] She was a member of House Erenford, a lesser house of landed knights from the Riverlands sworn to House Frey of the Twins.
            Catelyn Stark talks to a knight of House Frey at the Crossroads Inn. He tells her that Lord Walder is about to celebrate his 90th nameday and has taken another wife in celebration of the event. Tyrion Lannister finds this notion amusing, at least until the Frey knight agrees to help Catelyn take Tyrion prisoner for the attempted murder of her son Bran.[2]
            Arriving at the Twins, Catelyn greets Lord Walder Frey and his young, 15-year-old wife, Lady Joyeuse, whom Lord Walder gropes even as he speaks. Walder dismisses his family, including Joyeuse, while he and Catelyn haggle on what price the Starks will pay to be allowed to cross the river.[3]
            Lady Joyeuse is present at the main hall of the Twins when Robb Stark presents himself to pay his respects to Lord Walder and beg his forgiveness for the breaking of their marriage pact. She remains with her husband during the wedding ceremony of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey and sits beside him during the feast, but doesn't take part in the bedding.
            When the massacre of the Stark household and bannermen begins, Joyeuse, visibly scared, hides under a table while the carnage takes place. Injured, Catelyn Stark takes her hostage and threatens to kill her if Robb is not allowed to leave the Twins untouched. However, Lord Walder refuses, boasting he can get a new wife. After Robb is murdered by Roose Bolton, Catelyn slits Joyeuse's throat.[4]
            Kelly Long has been a stand-in for Emilia Clarke, Michelle Fairley, Lena Headey, and Sophie Turner. In Season 2, Long also began working full-time for Game of Thrones's art department.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lady Joyeuse is slightly older than in the TV show, aged sixteen. House Erenford is a minor vassal house of the Riverlands, sworn to House Frey. In the books, Catelyn does not kill her during the Red Wedding, but Aegon (aka Jinglebell), Lord Frey's mentally disabled grandson (not included in the TV series). Lady Joyeuse is later mentioned to be pregnant.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Joyeuse_Frey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemJoyeuseFrey</string></dict>

            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no prostitute named Genna. The only character by that name is Tywin Lannister's sister. This would seem to continue the TV producers' general practice that when they invent new characters for the TV series, they still try to use names from the books which are established to exist in Westeros (instead of making up entirely new ones, which might not sound like they fit).
            In the TV series, Tyrion pronounced "Genna" with a soft G, as opposed to a hard G.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Genna</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemGenna</string></dict>
        <key>Gilly</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.102.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gilly is one of the Free Folk, and is a daughter and wife of Craster. She is the mother (and half-sister) of a baby named Sam, who was produced through a forced relationship with her late father.
            Gilly is one of the many daughters of Craster, a wildling who lives beyond the Wall. She lives with him at Craster's Keep. As well as being a daughter of Craster, she is one of his wives, as Craster routinely marries his own daughters. At the time of the War of the Five Kings, Craster has nineteen wives, including Gilly. When the Night's Watch encounters her, Gilly is pregnant with the incestuous child of her own father.
            Gilly is named after the gillyflower.[1]
            A great ranging of the Night's Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont arrives at Craster's Keep. Inside the hall the Lord Commander meets with Craster and Gilly serves wine. During the meeting, Lord Mormont tells Craster that as things are getting dangerous, he and his household can come back with them to Castle Black for protection. Craster pulls Gilly over and instructs her to tell Jeor how content they are: calling him the Lord Crow, the speech she gives seems rehearsed. Gilly says that they are protected by Craster and that it is better to live free than die a slave. Craster is pleased by what she says.[2]
            While the Night's Watch stay at Craster's Keep, Gilly is scared by Ghost when the white direwolf approaches her, attracted by a dead rabbit she's holding. Samwell Tarly, who had already noticed her, tells Ghost to get away. Gilly notes Sam's courage and asks him to take her away. The two approach Jon Snow, who refuses to take Gilly, reminding the pair of Craster's threat. Gilly is afraid of what might happen to her baby if it's a boy but remains silent when Jon demands to know what Craster does with his male offspring.[3]
            Jon follows Craster into the woods and sees him leaving a newborn son for the White Walkers. Craster catches him, beats him, and takes him back into the keep. He throws him down at Lord Mormont's feet and demands that the Night's Watch leave his home. Sam spots Gilly carrying out her chores as he is preparing to leave and approaches her. He gives her a thimble that once belonged to his mother. He explains that he used to read to her while she was sewing but that his father ended the practice when he found out. He reveals that the thimble is the only possession he has from his mother and that it was a gift given when he left for the wall. Gilly says that he should not give it away and he explains that he is asking her to keep it safe until he returns for her. She accepts the thimble and the promise.[4]
            Obsessing over Gilly weeks later while talking to Grenn and Edd, Sam sees the beauty of the icy landscape and announces that Gilly would love it here. The others look at each other and say that there is nothing worse than a man in love. Sam says what interests him about her the most is that despite all that Craster has done to her, Gilly still has hope that life might get better.[5]
            The survivors of the Battle of the Fist of the First Men reach Craster's Keep. While warming on the fire, the loud wails of birthing pains can be heard throughout to Craster's great annoyance. Samwell Tarly leaves the main house to a birthing hut where he witnesses Gilly giving birth. To her horror, the baby is a boy. Sam and Gilly wordlessly realize that Craster will want to sacrifice him to the White Walkers.[6]
            Sam visits Gilly, who is deeply distraught about the fate of her newborn son. She is frantic, and yells at Sam not to draw attention to the fact that it's a boy by calling it a "he" so loud, as Craster will want to offer it up as a sacrifice when he finds out it's a son. He asks her if she's decided on a name, but she responds that there's no point in naming her baby if he's only going to be offered up as a human sacrifice. She gives Sam back his mother's thimble and says she doesn't care about such stupid things, all she's focused on is protecting the life of her baby.
            When the Night's Watch mutiny and kill Craster and Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, Sam rushes to Gilly's hut and orders her that they have to escape now or they never will. Sam runs out of Craster's Keep with Gilly and her baby, as loyal Night's Watch members fall to the mutineers, who also kill or rape Craster's other wives. Gilly leads the way into the night because she knows the woods around her home. Covered in Mormont's blood, Rast shouts into the darkness that "Piggy" can run for now, but he'll soon be cutting Sam's throat too.[7]
            After having fled Craster's Keep Samwell Tarly and Gilly stop to camp during their journey to The Wall. Sam shows Gilly the Dragonglass dagger he found at the Fist of the First Men and tells her about Castle Black. [8]
            After taking refuge in a destroyed cabin, Sam tries to light a fire, but is unable to, Gilly does it instead. Meanwhile, Sam suggests that Gilly name her son, but she does not know any boy names, Sam gives her some examples, and also explains the difference between first and last names. Suddenly, they are interrupted by the loud squawks of the crows. Sam and Gilly go outside to investigate, and see hundreds of crows angrily squawk at them. Gilly is then horrified to see a White Walker approaching them, and knows that it is after her child. Sam tries to halt its advance, but the Walker shatters his sword with its bare hand and knocks him aside, and heads for Gilly and her baby. Sam staggers back to his feet, pulls out his dragonglass dagger, and attacks the Walker, stabbing it in the back and kills it: shattering the Walker into thousands of ice-like pieces. Sam takes Gilly's arm, and runs as the crows chase after them.

As she loads them into a boat, Johnna and her sister ask Karsi if she'll go with them, to which their mother replies that she'll follow shortly. Karsi is killed shortly thereafter in the Massacre at Hardhome, but her daughters at that point have reached the safety of the Night's Watch ships.

            Daisy is a prostitute originally from Haystack Hall, in the Stormlands.
            She is a new prostitute in the brothel owned by Lord Petyr Baelish. She is learning about the brothel from Ros, impressed by the upmarket decor, and thinks that Armeca is beautiful. She is present when the infant Barra is killed by Lord Janos Slynt in front of her mother Mhaegen.[1]
            Daisy is sleeping with Grand Maester Pycelle when he is arrested by Tyrion Lannister for espionage. Tyrion pays her for her troubles.[2] Later, after a suggestion from his enforcer Bronn, Tyrion later hires Ros and Daisy as a late nameday present for his nephew King Joffrey Baratheon. They wait for him in his chamber. When he arrives Ros wishes him a happy name day and then reaches for his crotch. He flinches and then instructs Ros to touch Daisy. He asks if Ros can hit Daisy and she spanks her gently. Joffrey asks if Tyrion sent them and Ros says that Tyrion chose them himself. Joffrey takes off his belt and gives it to Ros to use. He forces Ros to hit Daisy hard enough to make her scream. He hands Ros a stag’s head sceptre and she protests that too much pain will spoil the pleasure. He loads his crossbow as Ros warns him that his uncle might find out. He tells Ros that he wants Tyrion to find out and orders her to take Daisy to Tyrion’s chambers to show him what has happened or she will also be beaten. He aims the crossbow at Ros and orders her to begin.[3] It is unknown if Daisy survived the beating as she is never seen in the brothel again.
            According to Masie Dee, who is a pornographic actress in real life, when she was initially cast the role was simply named "Nubile Whore" - which is what was posted on her trailer on set - though as her scenes in Season 2 developed the writers gave her the name "Daisy".[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character of this name. When Tyrion arrests Grand Maester Pycelle, he is in bed with a maid, but she is never named.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daisy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemDaisy</string></dict>

        <key>Gwyn Whitehill</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.107.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gwyn Whitehill is the eldest and only daughter of Lord Ludd Whitehill.
            Gwyn is from House Whitehill, and therefore is from their family seat of Highpoint. At some point in her youth, she fell in love with Asher Forrester, when they were seventeen and began a secret love affair. However their fathers Gregor Forrester and Ludd Whitehill, bitter rivals found out and bloodshed ensured between the two rival houses, and Asher was exiled across the Narrow Sea to Essos, ending their relationship. Unlike her father and younger brother Gwyn has a more caring side and is not arrogant, selfish and greedy like Ludd and Gryff.
            Gwyn does not appear in Iron From Ice but her name can be first seen on the codex page.
            Gwyn appears in this episode if Ryon is not brought back to Ironrath for his father's and brother's funeral. She comes to Ironrath by her own accord, and wishes to speak to Lord Rodrik. She lets him know that she is looking after Ryon at Highpoint, and that he is worried he is forgotten about.
            In this episode, Duncan tells Rodrik that Gwyn would like to speak to him away from her father. They ride out into the Ironwood forest traveling down a deforested path caused by Ludd to meet Gwyn. Gwyn finds Rodrik and pleads with him to put an end to the fighting with diplomacy and peace rather than bringing their houses to open war. She also tells Rodrik that the Whitehills know about the plan the Forrester small council decided upon and warns him that there is a traitor among his council. She then sneaks off into the forest before a group of Whitehill men find them.
            Gwyn is first seen in Highpoint and welcomes Rodrik, Elissa Forrester, Duncan/Royland and the Glenmore soldiers lead by Arthur (if Rodrik chose to bring them) to Highpoint and thanked them for accepting her father's invitation, while she guides them to the dining hall, depending on the player's choices she will either thank Rodrik for putting up with Gryff and expresses sympathy for how hard it was, or will be upset by Rodrik standing up to Gryff and warns them her father will play it his own way. She introduces the histories of Highpoint and Ironrath, who were once close as well as the Whitehill's family portrait to her guests. When she arrives at the dining hall she notices that Ludd has not arrived yet, puzzled, she leaves the dining hall to search for her father while leaving Rodrik and the others alone with the Whitehill soldiers.
            Shortly after she and her father arrive from the upper floors, both Whitehills and the Forresters sat down and start to discuss about ironwood business. Ludd will be upset by Rodrik's thoughts on the business regardless of what choice the player makes, and told Gwyn that his behavior not worth putting up with, Gwyn patiently tells her father to give Rodrik some time. When Rodrik reveals that Gryff is imprisoned, much to the Whitehills' shock, he offers a trade for Ryon. Ludd will grab his tool from the table with Gwyn staring at him, he calls out to bring the boy and suddenly holds a tool to Ryon's cheek, shocking everyone who happens to be in the hall, Gwyn begs her father and tries to calm everyone down by saying 'This is not what we agreed' but in vain, Ludd will rebuff by saying that it's on Rodrik and not him.
            After Ludd shows mercy to Ryon, and orders the Forresters to leave the hall. Gwyn, unable to keep her promise to Rodrik about offering a truce to the Forresters, is greatly upset by her father's actions and apologizes to Rodrik as they leave.
            If Rodrik is the surviving lord:
            Gwyn sends a Whitehill rider to Ironrath ahead of her father's army to warn Rodrik of their approach. She does not physically appear in the episode.
            If Asher is the surviving lord:
            After Ludd Whitehill and his army arrive at Ironrath, he declared that according to Ramsay's terms and with the death of Rodrik, he has won the feud between their rival houses. He then asks for Asher's surrender, telling him that if he bends the knee, he will remain the Lord of Ironrath as his bannerman and will also marry Gwyn. Asher feigns acceptance of these terms, believing Ludd would "Have his head" the minute Gwyn produced an heir and instead plans to ambush or poison Ludd during the celebratory feast, setting the stage for the White Engagement.
            Prior to the feast, Gwyn enters Ironrath's great hall and asks to speak with Asher privately. She then tells her old lover that she knows him and had deduced that he is preparing something. Gwyn begs him not to destroy the new peace between their families and making it clear that she still loves him and they could control the future of their houses if they wed before leaving to meet up with her father and brother. Asher is then given the choice to call off the poisoning/ambush.
            If Asher decides to go through with poisoning Ludd or setting an ambush during the feast, Gwyn stabs him in the back during the ensuing fight, telling him that he destroyed the peace between their families and their future together, before fleeing Ironrath.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gwyn_Whitehill</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemGwynWhitehill</string></dict>
        <key>Wylla</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.108.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wylla was a woman known by Eddard Stark.
            "Wylla" is pronounced "Why-luh," not "Will-uh."[1]
            Over a meal, Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark recall the names of several women they knew when they were younger. Robert recalls one woman whom he believes to be the mother of Eddard's bastard son Jon Snow, and Eddard confirms her name was "Wylla". The same as the first and only time they discuss it, Ned refuses to tell Robert what she looked like. Robert tells Eddard not to be too hard on himself as they were at war and could have died at any time.
            Jon Snow says Ned Stark never told him who his mother was, or if his mother is still alive.[1] Eddard had earlier promised Jon that he would talk to him about his mother the next time they met,[1] although Eddard's subsequent beheading made that impossible.[2]
            Watching Jon training his men in the practice yard of Castle Black, Selyse Baratheon dismisses him, opining that he is just the bastard son of some tavern slut that Eddard encountered. Her husband Stannis Baratheon, however, says he doubts that. Having known Eddard personally, he says it really wasn't the way of the honorable Ned Stark to frequent prostitutes the way that Stannis's own brother King Robert did.[3]
            During Greensight, Bran Stark discovers that Jon is not Ned Stark's son at all - he is actually Lyanna Stark's son, fathered by Rhaegar Targaryen, her alleged kidnapper, and born in the Tower of Joy while Ned and Howland Reed fought the last two Targaryen loyalists. This revelation does not debunk Wylla's existence, but she is certainly not Jon's mother.[4]
            The HBO Viewer's Guide for the TV series lists "Wylla" as Jon Snow's mother and deceased.[5]
            The question George R.R. Martin posed to David Benioff and D.B. Weiss at their first meeting to test their knowledge of the series was "Who do you think Jon Snow's mother is?" Benioff guessed correctly.[6]
            Martin has stated that he does already know who Jon Snow's mother is and she will eventually be revealed.[7] He has told some of the cast members secrets about their characters which have not been revealed in his novels yet, however he has only revealed things which their characters would logically know already. Kit Harington has said that Martin therefore did not tell him who Jon Snow's mother is because his character does not know.
            Harington says he prefers not to think too much about the various theories of his character's parentage as Jon Snow has come to accept that he will never learn the truth about his mother's identity.[8]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Arya later learns Wylla is a servant of House Dayne of Starfall and has been for many years. When she is with the Brotherhood Without Banners, one of their members is the young Edric Dayne, the new head of House Dayne. He explains that Wylla was his wet-nurse at Starfall, and that she previously also nursed Jon (who is about four years older than Edric). He doesn't know how or in what circumstances Wylla met Eddard, because he was born a few years after Eddard and Jon left, and no one ever said more about it. Wylla was therefore alive for some time after Jon's birth, but it is unknown if she is still alive.
            The novels make the mystery of Wylla truly being Jon Snow's mother more overt than in the TV series. Jon Snow is repeatedly noted for his striking physical resemblance to Ned at a young age, more so than any of Ned's trueborn sons - thus no one denies that Jon must have Stark blood in him.
            Throughout the course of the novels, many characters mention rumors about other women who could be Jon's mother, or speculate about it themselves. Catelyn herself heard maidservants discussing the rumor that Jon's mother was Ashara Dayne of Starfall - Edric's own aunt, not just a servant. Ashara's brother was Arthur Dayne of the Kingsguard, whom Ned and his allies killed in the final confrontation of the war, the Showdown at the Red Mountains. Afterwards Ned returned the Dayne ancestral sword Dawn to Starfall out of respect, at which Ashara unexpectedly committed suicide by throwing herself off a cliff into the sea. The rumor was that Ashara didn't simply kill herself because her brother died in war (which happens to many women), but out of grief that her own lover had killed him. Catelyn asked Eddard about Ashara and Jon once early in their marriage: it was the only time Eddard ever truly became angry at her and frightened Catelyn. He said nothing, but commanded her never to ask about Ashara or about the identity of Jon's mother ever again, and indeed she never did afterwards. Even so this was only one of the more prominent of several rumors about the identity of Jon's mother. Others say that she was a fisherman's daughter in the Vale, where Eddard had been staying as a ward of Jon Arryn when the war broke out, and that he fathered Jon on her as he was fleeing back to the North to raise its armies after the Mad King killed his father and brother.
            As in the TV series, the only woman that Ned himself ever identifies as Jon Snow's mother is "Wylla" - only once, when King Robert asked, and Eddard isn't in a position to refuse his king an answer. Ned also tells King Robert that he does not want to discuss Wylla any further with him since his adultery was his dishonor towards himself and his wife.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Wylla</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemWylla</string></dict>

            Viola Redwyne is a member of House Redwyne a noble house sworn to House Tyrell and rulers of the Arbor, an island in the Summer Sea.
            Viola is mentioned by her sister Olenna Tyrell as being originally bethrothed to Olenna's late husband, Lord Luthor Tyrell. Olenna met Luthor after she left an embroidery lesson, and had "accidentally" stumbled upon Luthor's room. The next morning, when Luthor was supposed to meet Viola, he did not turn up because he couldn't walk, and only wanted what Olenna had given him the previous night. Olenna didn't mention if Viola ever married into House Tyrell, or if she ever married at all.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there is no character named Viola, either of House Redwyne or any other house. Viola was perhaps added to demonstrate the lengths Olenna was willing to go to so as to not have to marry a Targaryen, which is mentioned in the books but never explained in any detail.
            "Viola Redwyne" was invented by the TV series in Season 4, before the World of Ice and Fire sourcebook was released in late 2014, which revealed Olenna's actual backstory from the book continuity, which contradicts this information: Olenna Redwyne was engaged to Prince Daeron Targaryen, youngest son of King Jaehaerys II. It was actually Daeron's sister, Shaera Targaryen, who was originally betrothed to Luthor Tyrell.
            In the TV series, Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch explained in Season 1's "Baelor" that his younger brother Aegon succeeded their father as king (after Aemon declined the throne, due to his vows). His younger brother was crowned as King Aegon V Targaryen. Aegon V had three sons: Duncan "the Small" (named for his father's great friend Ser Duncan the Tall), Jaehaerys II, and Daeron. Aegon V also had two daughters: Shaera and Rhaelle.
            Aegon V wanted all of his children to enter into political marriage-alliances, to bolster the crown's strength (during a time when Aegon V was enacting populist reforms that lowered taxes on the poor while raising taxes on rich nobles, turning many against the throne). Aegon V, however, had married for love himself, so when his children rejected each of these betrothals he ultimately relented, rather than seem hypocritical.
            Duncan the Small infamously fell in love with a commoner, Jenny of Oldstones, and had to abdicate his place in the line of succession as a result.
            Originally, Aegon V's daughter Shaera was betrothed to Luthor Tyrell, and Jaehaerys II was betrothed to a Tully girl, while Daeron was betrothed to Olenna Redwyne. Neither Shaera, nor Daeron, nor Olenna were happy with the matches.
            Aegon V was determined to end the incestuous marriage practices of the Targaryens, so betrothing his children to unrelated noble families served a two-in-one goal, of ending their brother-sister marriages, as well as strengthening ties to the other Great Houses. Prince Jaehaerys and Princess Shaera grew attracted to each other, however, and their parents tried to put a stop to it, physically separating them in different locations. Their parents' attempts to end their relationship only inflamed their passions even more and more, until ultimately Jaehaerys and Shaera eloped by sneaking out of the castle and marrying without permission - though Aegon V ultimately relented and acknowledged it.
            The TV series had Olenna say that she was repulsed by the Targaryen she was betrothed to. The World book explains that Daeron had no interest in the match either: Daeron was actually a homosexual, and was in a long-term relationship with his constant companion Ser Jeremy Norridge.
            Olenna did not need to seduce Luthor Tyrell: Shaera eloped with her brother Jaehaerys to get out of the betrothal to Luthor, which suddenly made Luthor open to a new betrothal. After Jaehaerys and Shaera eloped, Daeron publicly declared that if neither of his older brothers could be forced into arranged marriages, he could not be justly forced into one himself - Aegon V reluctantly agreed. Freed from a betrothal that neither Olenna or Daeron wanted, Olenna was then able to marry Luthor Tyrell...though exactly how she secured a betrothal to Luthor, ahead of noble ladies from other major Houses from the Reach (such as House Florent) is not clear, and may have still involved seducing him.
            Jaehaerys II succeeded his father as king, and while ruling for only three years before dying of an illness (having always been a physically frail man), he ruled well, successfully responding to the fifth and final Blackfyre Rebellion, known as the War of the Ninepenny Kings. The children of Jaehaerys II and Shaera were Aerys II and Rhaella, who were also married together in the incestuous custom of the Targaryens. Aegon V's fears later proved true, however, as many believe that Aerys II's incestuous bloodline is what caused his insanity in later life - leading to Aerys II being called "the Mad King". The children of Aerys II the Mad and Rhaella were, of course, Rhaegar, Viserys, and Daenerys.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Viola_Redwyne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemViolaRedwyne</string></dict>
        <key>Waif</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.110.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The Waif was an acolyte of the Faceless Men serving in the House of Black and White in Braavos.
            When playing The Game of Faces with Arya, she claimed that prior to joining the Faceless Men she was the daughter of a widowed lord from Westeros who remarried another woman and produced a second daughter. Her jealous stepmother then tried to poison her. The woman who became the Waif discovered this plot and sought the help of the Faceless Men. She subsequently found her way to the House of Black and White in Braavos. Since the point of the Game of Faces is to mix lies with the truth convincingly, we can presume that parts of her story were false and other parts were true.[1]
            The Waif has a sour demeanor and low opinion of Arya Stark when she arrives at the House of Black and White. When Arya presumes to claim that she is "no one"—a skill that the Faceless Men only achieve through dedicated training—the Waif becomes angered and beats Arya with her cane. She overpowers Arya and beats her to the floor before she can react. Jaqen H'ghar then enters the room and makes her stop. Jaqen is also critical of Arya, but more gently explains that she cannot truly be "no one" yet because she still thinks of herself as "Arya Stark", wearing Arya's clothes and carrying Arya's remaining possessions. Later, Jaqen leads Arya into the basement of the building where the bodies of those who come to seek the mercy of a quick death are taken. The Waif is there, and knows her way around well enough to undress and wash the body. Arya begins to help her, and asks what they do with the bodies after they are cleaned, but the Waif gives no response.[2]
            Later, the Waif obstructs Arya when she tries to walk through the door where the bodies are taken. When Arya queries about the fate of the bodies she has cleaned, the Waif tells her to be patient. When Arya tries to play the game of faces, the Waif harshly rebuffs her and orders Arya to return to work. Before the Waif can leave, Arya asks her who she used to be. The Waif claims that she was the daughter of a widowed Lord who remarried and produced another daughter. The jealous stepmother then tried to poison her but the Waif discovered this plot and sought the help of the Faceless Men. After telling her story, the Waif startles Arya by asking whether she believed her. When Arya expressed surprise, the Waif responds that Arya must be able to lie convincingly in order to pass the game of faces.[1]
            When Jaqen sends Arya out on her first assignment to deliver a gift of the Many-Faced God to the Thin man, the Waif expresses doubt as to Arya's readiness and chance of success.[3] Instead of assassinating the Thin man, Arya murders the Kingsguard Ser Meryn Trant to avenge the death of Syrio Forel. The Waif and Jaqen intercept Arya when she tries to return a mask to the Hall of Faces. By killing the wrong man, Arya has cheated the Many-Faced God. The Waif gloats over Arya's failure and grabs her while Jaqen drinks a vial of poison and collapses.[4]
            The Waif watches in elation while a distraught Arya weeps beside the body of Jaqen. When the Waif asks why Arya is mourning, she replies that Jaqen was her friend. Suddenly, Arya hears Jaqen's voice saying "he was no one." Arya then turned around only to find Jaqen standing in place of the Waif. As punishment for taking the wrong life, Arya is rendered blind.[4]
            After Arya is blinded and reduced to begging on the streets of Braavos, the Waif forces Arya to fight her with two fighting sticks. Due to Arya's blinded state, the Waif gains the upper hand over Arya and leaves her beaten and bruised. Before leaving, she tells Arya that she will be back the following day.[5] The following day, the Waif revisits Arya and asks her name. Though Arya replies that she is "no one", the Waif is still unconvinced and beats her a second time. In response to the Waif's taunt, Arya tries to fight back only to find that the Waif has been replaced by Jaqen H'ghar. After testing Arya three times, he deems her worthy to rejoin the Faceless Men and takes her back to the House of Black and White.[6]
            Later, the Waif continues training Arya in the House of Black and White. The Waif plays the game of faces with Arya, questioning her about her family, the Hound and the people on her kill list. Arya recites her list for the Waif who comments that it is short and cannot be everyone she wants to kill, she then queries if Arya is forgetting 'someone', implying herself, Arya then asks which name the Waif would like her to speak suggesting the Waif is not on her list because Arya does not know her name. The Waif spars with Arya on a large stone tablet, during which the Waif hits Arya with a fighting stick despite Arya having no vision, these fighting lessons are suggested to be going on for at least several days. At first the Waif constantly outmaneuvers her repeatedly knocking her to the ground however, eventually Arya manages to respond and defends herself with her own fighting stick to the point where the Waif becomes visibly distressed. When Arya lands a blow of her own the Waif seemingly becomes overwhelmed with anger and makes a rash move which Arya intercepts whilst Jaqen observes. The Waif then reluctantly leaves Arya alone with Jaqen, who restores her sight after deeming her worthy of becoming a Faceless Man.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Waif</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemWaif</string></dict>
        <key>Violet</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.111.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Violet was a young woman in service to House Bolton at the Dreadfort, and a bedwarmer of Snow.
            Violet is a servant of House Bolton of the Dreadfort.
            Violet and Myranda enter the torture cellar in which Theon Greyjoy is kept hostage, release the former Prince of Winterfell and put him on a bed. Then they attempt to seduce him, claiming they have heard the heir to Pyke is "well endowed". Violet claims Myranda was in training to become a septa but her sexual urges kept her from taking the vows. Theon is initially distrustful but cannot help but grow aroused when Myranda, stripped of her clothes by Violet, straddles him.
            Suddenly, the girls are interrupted by a horn sounded by Ramsay Snow, who approaches his two servants and taunts Theon, telling him he too has heard about Theon's manhood and showing him a gelding knife. Myranda and Violet then watch as Theon is held by two men while Ramsay proceeds to geld him.[1]
            While bathing Sansa Stark, Myranda reveals Ramsay grew tired of Violet and ended up killing her after she became pregnant. Although Myranda did not elaborate any further than that, it is possible that Violet's unborn child was fathered by Ramsay.[2]
            George R.R. Martin stated on the DVD commentary of "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" that he had written a scene involving Myranda and Violet for the fourth season. Stephanie Blacker was not available for the fourth season due to pregnancy. Since Martin wrote "The Lion and the Rose", this seems to suggest that the role played by Tansy in the episode was originally intended for Violet. Violet's in-universe fate might be a reference to Blacker's real-life reason for not returning.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the only character named Violet is an old peasant woman who used to visit Riverrun, looking for old shoes in need of new soles. She does not appear in the books, being only mentioned by Catelyn Stark and Maester Vyman.
            In the novels, Ramsay surrounds himself with a group of favorites, referred to as the "Bastard's Boys", who take part in his mind games and tortures. However, there is no mention of any women in the group.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Violet</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemViolet</string></dict>
        <key>Vala</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.112.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vala is a prostitute living in Meereen and a secret member of the Sons of the Harpy.
            Vala is a prostitute in Meereen who is secretly in league with the Sons of the Harpy, a resistance movement against Daenerys Targaryen.
            Vala is approached by White Rat, an Unsullied, who has been repeatedly frequenting her. White Rat pays her, then keeps her from disrobing and removing his trousers - as a eunuch he is unable to have intercourse - instead having her lie behind him and caress him as she hums a melody to him. However, she is in league with the Sons of the Harpy and, as he is distracted, one of them enters the room and slits his throat. Vala and the murderer watch as White Rat quickly bleeds to death.[1]
            Later on, she aids the Sons of the Harpy in setting a trap for several Unsullied, among them Grey Worm, which leads to the death of Ser Barristan Selmy.[2]
            Eventually, the Unsullied find and apprehend Vala. She is brought before Varys in the Great Pyramid, who interrogates her for information on the Sons of the Harpy. It seems that Vala became a prostitute to get close to Unsullied and Second Sons on the Sons of the Harpy's behalf, expressing vehement hatred for Daenerys and her soldiers, whom she sees as destroying Meereen. She initially refuses Varys, believing that the eunuch wishes to torture her, though he assures her this is not the case and will only lead to misinformation from her. Instead, Varys calmly backs her into a corner with knowledge of her young son, Dom, and how bad his life must be if he loses his mother. When the Spider promises safe passage to Pentos for Vala and her son, as well as a generous bag of silver to buy a new life, she agrees to cooperate. She tells him that the masters of Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis fund the Sons of the Harpy.[3]
            The character first appeared in Season 5 but wasn't given a name until Season 6.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character named Vala. Stalwart Shield, White Rat's equivalent, repeatedly visits a brothel to have women lie with and hold him. There is no mention if he has a preferred prostitute. Also, there is no indication if any of the prostitutes were in league with the Sons of the Harpy during the attack in which he was killed.
            Strictly speaking, "vala" in High Valyrian means "man" (like how the name "Adam" literally means "man"), but an entirely separate word is used for "woman", "abrar". This might be pure coincidence and not necessarily incongruent - after all, Slaver's Bay was founded by the Ghiscari, and there have been a large influx of new words and names from foreign lands due to importing large numbers of slaves, so a few homonyms between the local dialect and proper High Valyrian would probably happen.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Vala</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemVala</string></dict>
        <key>Brienne of Tarth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.113.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brienne Tarth, commonly known as Brienne of Tarth, is a warrior of House Tarth, vassals to House Baratheon, and the only daughter of Lord Selwyn Tarth.
            Brienne is the sole surviving child and heir of Lord Selwyn Tarth of Evenfall Hall, on the island of Tarth, located in the Narrow Sea off the coast of the Stormlands. She is unusually tall and muscular for a woman by Westerosi standards and developed a taste for martial activity as a child. Brienne has grown up to become skilled at arms and dreams of becoming a knight.[1]
            Brienne's mother died when she was so young that she doesn't remember her.[2] She had some siblings but they all died in childhood.[3] As the sole heir of House Tarth, she posed a fairly promising marriage prospect for men from other noble Houses, but due to her physicality and personality has never seriously pursued a marriage alliance with another House.
            She is also called The Maid of Tarth, or, disparagingly, Brienne the Beauty, due to her appearance.
            Lord Petyr Baelish also visits Renly's camp, as an envoy from King Joffrey Baratheon. Renly tells Petyr that he does not trust him and cites Brienne as having true loyalty. This mistrust seems well founded, as Petyr offers to open the gates of King’s Landing to Renly. While in camp, he also proposes that Catelyn exchange Robb's captive Ser Jaime Lannister for her daughters. Brienne also guards Renly during an unsuccessful meeting with his brother, King Stannis Baratheon. Stannis threatens Renly for refusing to swear fealty to him.[5] Later that evening, Renly talks with Lady Catelyn in his tent, agreeing to recognize Robb Stark as King in the North, as long as Robb gives him fealty as an overlord and recognizes his claim to the Iron Throne. Brienne is removing his armor when the flap of the tent flutters as if the wind has raised it, and Melisandre's Shadow-creature materializes to stab Renly in the back, running him through. Brienne is devastated at witnessing the death, but recognizes that the Shadow had the likeness of Stannis. She cries out and catches him as he falls, getting his blood all over herself. When two other members of Renly's Kingsguard who were guarding the tent rush in, they blame Brienne for the death and attack her. She is forced to kill Sers Robar Royce and Emmon Cuy, and Catelyn convinces her to flee the camp, as she cannot avenge Renly if she is dead herself.[2]
            Brienne swears an oath of fealty to Catelyn, becoming her sworn sword. They travel back to Robb's camp in the Westerlands.[2] Catelyn is devastated by news that her home Winterfell has been captured by the turncloak Theon Greyjoy and her sons made his captives. Robb, still in the midst of fighting for the Riverlands, plans to send word to a vassal in the North, the bastard of one of his commanders Roose Bolton, to free them and leaves to negotiate the surrender of the Crag.[6]
            Jaime escapes captivity, killing Torrhen Karstark in the attempt. He is soon recaptured, but Torrhen's father Lord Rickard Karstark demands his head in vengeance. Brienne guards Catelyn as she convinces Rickard to await Robb's return. As the hours until daylight stretch before them, the Karstarks are getting more violent and agitated, calling for Jaime Lannister's death. As it would be death to try to defend him, Brienne tells Catelyn that at this rate Jaime will not live long enough for Robb to return.[7] Catelyn decides to free Jaime in an attempt to exchange him for her two daughters, who she believes are both being held hostage in King's Landing by the Lannisters. She orders Brienne to smuggle Jaime from the camp and deliver him to King's Landing in order to secure the safety of her daughters. Brienne travels by horse until finding a rowboat to evade pursuit. She suffers the constant antagonism of her captive as he taunts her about her appearance and her likely dismal history with the opposite sex.[8]
            When they come upon a tree with the hanging corpses of three tavern girls who have been killed by Stark forces for having relations with Lannister men, Jaime confronts her with the atrocity committed by "her side". Brienne reminds him that she is sworn to Lady Catelyn, not the Starks. Despite their need to continue, Brienne determines to give the women a decent burial and is going to cut them down, when three of the Northern soldiers who killed the women return. Jaime tries to get her to remove his chains so he can defend them, but Brienne ignores him. She tells the men that she is escorting a prisoner back to Riverrun for justice. Jaime improvises that he is in chains for stealing a pig. Realizing that Brienne is a woman, the Stark soldiers laugh uncontrollably. Brienne suffers it in silence, and at this even Jaime seems sympathetic towards her over this rude treatment. She deflects the men's amusement by asking if the hanging women were given a quick death, and is told two of them were. When one of the men recognizes Jaime from the Battle of the Whispering Wood, Brienne is forced to fight them. She kills two quickly, but deliberately gives the third a slower death. Her skill impresses Ser Jaime, who points out that the men she killed were Stark soldiers. Brienne reaffirms that she is loyal not to the Starks but to Catelyn Stark herself, then returns to the task of cutting down and burying the tavern girls.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemBrienneofTarth</string></dict>

        <key>Bethany Redwyne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.115.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bethany Redwyne is a member of House Redwyne.
            When Ser Brynden Tully returned from the War of the Ninepenny Kings he was hailed as a hero of the conflict, but his older brother Lord Hoster Tully greeted him with a marriage betrothal he had contracted on his behalf, in which Brynden would marry Bethany Redwyne. Brynden openly admitted that it was a good match and an opportunity for House Tully to ally with a very rich House.
            However, Brynden refused to take part in the marriage, saying at the time that he would not simply be told when and whom to marry. From Hoster's point of view, many Tullys in past generations had been asked to do their duty for the good of the House and enter into arranged marriages to secure powerful alliances: even Brynden did not deny that it was a good match, but nonetheless refused to further the fortunes of his family. This led to a severe argument between the two brothers that would last much of the rest of their lives. Hoster called Brynden the "black goat" of the Tully herd, but considering their family's heraldry of a silver trout, Brynden joked that it would be more apt to say he was the black fish of the Tully school - the nickname stuck with Brynden ever since, and he even took a black trout as his personal sigil.
            Brynden somewhat rued his decision years later during Robert's Rebellion: House Redwyne controls one of the largest fleets in Westeros, based at the Arbor, and this could have been added to the rebels' side. Instead, the Redwynes stayed loyal to the Targaryens.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the exact familial relationship between Bethany Redwyne and the main branch of House Redwyne is unknown. Olenna Tyrell was born Olenna Redwyne, and is the aunt of the current Lord Paxter Redwyne. It isn't clear if Bethany is Olenna's sister or a more distant cousin.
            Bethany Redwyne later married Lord Mathis Rowan, head of House Rowan - another powerful family from the Reach, whose seat Goldengrove is located in the northwest, on the borders with the Westerlands. They have three children. Their daughter was caught in bed with Dareon, and to protect her reputation she accused him of rape which resulted in him being sent to The Wall.
            Had Brynden agreed to the marriage-alliance with House Redwyne, it would have drastically altered Robert's Rebellion by giving the rebels access to the large fleet of House Redwyne, but given that he didn't, the war was decided entirely on land. Indeed, while the Tyrells and the rest of the Reach actively fought on the Royalist side in the war, it is stated that the Redwynes were among the staunchest Targaryen loyalists.
            Hoster came up with several alternate marriage-alliance proposals over the years, all of them admittedly quite good matches, but Brynden refused them all, adding to the bickering between the two brothers.
            Brynden never said exactly why he refused to marry Bethany Redwyne (or anyone else since), leading to much fan speculation:</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bethany_Redwyne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemBethanyRedwyne</string></dict>
        <key>Beskha</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.116.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Beskha is an inhabitant of Essos and a woman sellsword who fights alongside Asher Forrester.
            Beskha used to be a slave. At a very young age, she became a slave and was forced to kill other children for her master's amusement. At one point, she was forced to kill a good friend of hers who she used to play with. At some point in her life, she became a sellsword and befriended Asher Forrester, an exiled man who became her drinking, thieving and fighting companion four years prior to the events of the game.
            Beskha makes her first appearance in this episode. She and her sellsword friend, Asher, are in Yunkai three days after the city's liberation. They managed to capture Bezzaq, a former slave master with a bounty on his head, and are awaiting in an abandoned tavern to collect the reward. To their surprise, the Lost Legion arrive and their leader,Tazal, demands the captive. Tazal eventually murders Bezzaq and orders his men to kill Asher and Beskha, planning to blame them for the captive's death and claim the reward money for killing them. Asher and Beskha defeat Tazal's men and severely wounds or kills (player decision) Tazal himself. More Legion men show up and two of them overpower Asher while Beskha is busy fighting another. Asher's uncle, Malcolm Branfield, arrives and saves Asher and the three flee the tavern.
            Beskha stands in the background while Malcolm talks to Asher and informs him of the deaths of his father and brother(s) and that he is in Yunkai to take Asher back to Ironrath. Malcolm tells Asher that the only way to save house Forrester is if they return with an army of mercenaries to fight against the Whitehills. Asher and Beskha decide to call in a favor with an old acquaintance to secure a sellsword army in Meereen. Beskha, however seems troubled about going to Meereen, stating that she has unfinished business there, and refusing to talk about it. She dismisses her doubts and assures Asher it won't be a problem. While Beskha, Asher and Malcolm are leaving Yunkai, they encounter and dodge the Lost Legion once more.
            The episode begins with Asher, Malcolm and Beskha continuing on their adventure to Meereen. They reach a dead end and they must find a way out. Malcolm demonstrates a strong knowledge of the area's geography and suggests a cave may be nearby, carved out by underground streams. Sure enough, Asher finds an opening and then the Lost Legion members catch up with them, the three of them escape into the tunnel. Asher looks for a way out while Malcolm and Beskha fight off the Lost Legion.
            During the three way battle between Asher's group, the Lost Legion and Drogon, Malcolm is attacked by two of the Lost Legion. One of them spears him in the leg but he is seemingly fine, while Beskha attempts to fend off Drogon. Asher is given the choice to save one of the two.
            Drogon burns Beskha, but she claims that she is fine. Malcolm climbs out of the cave while Asher aids Beskha. Drogon swoops in for another attack but the group escape.
            In Meereen, Malcolm tells them that he will find Croft while Asher speaks with Beskha. He returns after their conversation and leads them to Croft, asking how well they know him. When they don't give a very comforting reply he insists that he thought they were allies. Asher says they are very good friends, but the first thing Croft does is punch him in the face. His men pin Asher against the wall and says he has to pay him back by losing an eye, tongue or arm. Once Asher makes his decision or tells Croft to fuck himself, Croft reveals that he is just kidding. Malcolm remarks that Croft has an odd sense of humour as the man reveals that one of Daenerys's dragons has gone missing.
            Asher reveals that he saw Drogon and can show Croft Beskha's burns as proof, then goes on to ask about recruiting some of his men. Croft schedules a time to speak with Daenerys about Drogon and saving House Forrester. Malcolm is last seen waiting outside of Daenerys's tent with Beskha and Croft.
            Drogon burns Malcolm along with the Lost Legion members, but Malcolm insists he is fine. Beskha climbs out of the cave while Asher aids his uncle. Drogon swoops in for another attack but the group escape.
            In Meereen, Beskha tells them that she will find Croft while Asher speaks with Malcolm. Malcolm tells his nephew that choices define who he is, and that he should save family over friends. Asher can agree and apologise, or refuse to be lectured. Beskha returns after their conversation and leads them to Croft, while Malcolm asks how well they know him. When they don't give a very comforting reply he insists that he thought they were allies. Asher says they are very good friends, but the first thing Croft does is punch him in the face. His men pin Asher against the wall and says he has to pay him back by losing an eye, tongue or arm.

        <key>Bethany Bracken</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.117.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bethany Bracken was a member of House Bracken who lived during the reign of Aegon IV Targaryen.
            Bethany Bracken was a mistress of King Aegon IV, the Unworthy. She was caught abed with Ser Terrence Toyne, a knight of the Kingsguard. King Aegon had Ser Terrence fed to his dogs.[1]
            In A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Bethany is indirectly referred to. Her identity was revealed by GRRM in an interview, which established her as Aegon IV's seventh mistress, and her backstory expaned in The World of Ice and Fire. Bethany Bracken was groomed from childhood by her father, who had been Aegon's Hand of the King, and her older sister, Barbra Bracken, to seduce King Aegon and replace Melissa Blackwood, who had in turn replaced Barbra as Aegon's mistress, thus restoring the king's favor upon House Bracken.
            Bethany caught Aegon's eye, as his father and sister intended, when he visited Stone Hedge to visit Aegor Rivers, one of his bastard sons, and took her with him to King's Landing. However, Bethany found his "royal embraces" distressing, and turned to Ser Terrence Toynce for comfort and the two became lovers. They were caught abed by Aegon himself, resulting in the death by torture of Ser Terrence and the execution of Bethany and her father.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bethany_Bracken</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemBethanyBracken</string></dict>
        <key>Barra</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.118.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Barra was the bastard daughter of King Robert I Baratheon and Mhaegen.
            Barra is an infant, the bastard child of King Robert Baratheon and Mhaegen. Mhaeghen is a prostitute working for Petyr Baelish in King's Landing. Barra lives with Mhaegen in one of his brothels. Her name may be a reference to her father's noble House, Baratheon.
            Lord Baelish brings Eddard Stark to see Mhaegen at his brothel. She tells him that her daughter Barra is Robert Baratheon's child, one of his many bastards. Jaime Lannister and his men ambush Eddard while he is leaving the brothel where Barra lives.[1]
            During a purge of the late King Robert's bastard children carried out by the Gold Cloaks, the brothel is stormed and both Mhaegen and Barra are brought outside. Lord Janos Slynt orders Barra killed, but his men cannot go through with it, prompting Slynt to kill Barra himself before the eyes of her mother and several prostitutes, including Ros.[2] When news of Barra's death (as well as her killer's other actions) reaches the acting Hand of the King, Tyrion Lannister, he has Janos exiled to the Wall.[3]
            Barra and all her other half-siblings that were killed are eventually given a small justice when Janos Slynt is beheaded by Lord Commander Jon Snow.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Barra is identified as an infant with thin, dark hair. Her mother is 15 years old and her name is never mentioned. When Eddard Stark sees baby Barra, he thinks of how much she resembles her half-sister, the eldest of Robert's bastards Mya Stone, whom Robert fathered at a young age when they were fostered by Jon Arryn at the Eyrie (she has not appeared yet in the TV series).
            The brothel where Barra lives is not owned by Littlefinger but by Chataya, a tall and elegant black-skinned woman from the Summer Islands.
            Following the bloody brawl with Jaime, Cersei accuses Eddard of being drunk after a night of debauchery in the brothel. Eddard tells Robert he had only gone there to see the baby, Barra. Robert is quite embarrassed to hear that. However, by telling Robert why he was at the brothel, Ned also made Cersei aware of the baby's existence (though Cersei could also have been informed about Barra from her spies, so it is uncertain if Ned indirectly caused the baby's death).
            When a dying Robert makes Eddard swear that he will protect and be a second father to his children, it is Barra, Gendry, and Mya Stone that Eddard thinks of when he takes the oath.
            Afterwards, Barra is ordered to be killed - though in the books, no mention is made that a string of other bastard children are also killed (it is said that Cersei has had two of Robert's bastards secretly murdered in the past). It is one of the gold cloaks, Allar Deem, instead of Janos Slynt himself, who kills the baby, and her mother as well who tries to protect the child. When Slynt is made Lord of Harrenhal, he recommends Allar Deem to replace him as commander of the Gold Cloaks. However, Tyrion orders that Deem be sent to the Wall with Slynt. Tyrion also sends the captain of the ship that is taking them there a message that if a wave washes Deem overboard it would not be amiss.
            When Tyrion discusses Barra's death with Varys, Varys says, looking grief-stricken "There was another bastard, a boy, older. I took steps to see him removed from harm's way... but I confess, I never dreamed the babe would be at risk. A baseborn girl, less than a year old, with a whore for a mother. What threat could she pose?". Tyrion answers bitterly "She was Robert's. That was enough for Cersei, it would seem". While Tyrion genuinely grieves for Barra, it is unclear if Varys is really sorry for her. His excuse for not acting to save Barra is questionable, given that everyone knows the Lannisters and their henchmen are not above killing small children and infants.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Barra</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemBarra</string></dict>
        <key>Ashara Dayne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.119.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lady Ashara Dayne was a lady of House Dayne and the sister of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning.
            Lady Ashara Dayne was present at the great tourney at Harrenhal in the Year of the False Spring, where she danced with Ser Barristan Selmy and several others. Towards the end of the evening, she was approached by Brandon Stark who asked her for a dance on behalf of his shy younger brother Eddard. She accepted and she and Eddard shared the last dance of the celebration.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lady Ashara Dayne was renowned for her great beauty. She was tall and had long hair and violet eyes. She was an object of infatuation for many men and including Ser Barristan Selmy and, according to rumor, Eddard Stark.
            Ashara was a lady-in-waiting to Princess Elia Martell.
            Following the Showdown at the Tower of Joy, Eddard Stark traveled to Starfall to inform House Dayne of Ser Arthur Dayne's death and return his sword, Dawn. Ashara committed suicide by throwing herself from the top of the Palestone Sword, the tallest tower in Starfall, onto the cliff atop the sea. Her body was never found.
            Ashara was suspected to be the mother of Jon Snow, and that her suicide was caused by the grief over the hand her alleged lover Eddard played in her brother's death. Catelyn Stark asked him if this was true, and Eddard angrily told her to never ask him about Jon, that the boy was his blood and that this was all she needed to know. Ashara's name was never mentioned in Winterfell again after this.
            Despite these rumors, Barristan Selmy believed that Ashara had given birth to a stillborn daughter, and that a man had dishonored her during the tourney at Harrenhal.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ashara_Dayne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemAsharaDayne</string></dict>

            It isn't clear if she is actually a child prostitute or just a servant girl working at the brothel, though, considering her common attire and state of general confusion when presented to Trant, the latter is likely.
            The Braavosi madam is present when Ser Meryn Trant visits the brothel she works in, seeking a prostitute. She presents three prostitutes to him, but he claims that they are all too old. Realizing with some distaste what Trant is seeking, she presents him with a very young serving girl. Trant informs the madam that he expects a "fresh" one tomorrow night, again to her distaste. Throughout the exchange, the Madam is vexed by the presence of Lanna, a young oyster-seller, so deep in the brothel, and warns her not to show up there again.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aya</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemAya</string></dict>
        <key>Alerie Tyrell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.121.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alerie Tyrell, née Hightower, is the wife of Mace Tyrell and mother of Loras and Margaery Tyrell.
            Alerie Tyrell is a daughter of House Hightower. She is the wife of Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden and the head of House Tyrell. They had two children, Loras and Margaery. She is the elder sister of Lynesse Hightower, the estranged wife of Ser Jorah Mormont.[1][2] Her entire family were murdered during the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor and her mother-in-law Olenna Tyrell subsequently adopted the title of House Tyrell's leader until Highgarden was lost to House Lannister, resulting in Olenna's death.
            In A Song of Ice and Fire, her family remains the same, except she and Mace have two other sons, named Willas and Garlan. She is described as tall and dignified and has long silver hair (presumably from age and not Valyrian heritage). She is younger than her husband. Alerie is actually present in King's Landing with most of the other Tyrells. She attended the Purple Wedding and comforted Margaery when her new husband was poisoned. She remained through Tywin's funeral before leaving King's Landing with Olenna and Garlan. At a function, she refers to Olenna as "mother", but Olenna snaps that she would have remembered giving birth to Alerie, and that she is "only to blame" for Alerie's husband.
            Alerie's father is Lord Leyton Hightower. The identity of her mother is unclear: Leyton's fourth and current wife is Rhea Florent, but Alerie's mother might have been one of his previous wives. Gerold Hightower, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during Robert's Rebellion, was Leyton's uncle - thus, through Alerie, the famed Ser Loras Tyrell is in fact the grandson of Gerold's nephew.
            Alerie's status in the TV continuity is uncertain, as she never appeared or was even mentioned as being alive or dead. She doesn't appear at her own daughter's two weddings. Even the Tyrell actors said it was never clearly established what the status of Alerie was, and the writers may have kept it deliberately vague to keep their options open as the story progressed. By the end of Season 6, it seems probable that she simply died some years before the TV series even began.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Alerie_Tyrell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemAlerieTyrell</string></dict>
        <key>Alannys Greyjoy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.122.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Alannys Greyjoy, née Harlaw, was born into House Harlaw[1] and married Balon Greyjoy, head of House Greyjoy and the Lord Reaper of Pyke.
            Alannys Greyjoy was born into House Harlaw[1] and married Balon Greyjoy, head of House Greyjoy and the Lord Reaper of Pyke. They had four children: Rodrik, Maron, Yara, and Theon. Only her daughter, Yara, and her youngest son, Theon, are still alive.
            Her two eldest sons were killed in the Greyjoy Rebellion. Balon Greyjoy surrendered his and Alannys's only surviving son Theon, then aged 10, as a hostage as punishment for the uprising and to ensure there would be no others. Eddard Stark volunteered to raise Theon as his ward in Winterfell.[2]
            Alannys is not present when Theon returns to Pyke on a mission to create an alliance between his father and Robb Stark.[3]
            When Yara is pleading with Theon to abandon his attempt to hold Winterfell and that he must return to Pyke, she says they are connected as they both loved their mother. The mention of Alannys makes Theon upset and look away.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, her marriage to Lord Balon Greyjoy and the children they had remains the same except Yara is named Asha. Because the island of Harlaw is the wealthiest of the Iron Islands, House Harlaw is one of the few ironborn families that approach the Greyjoys in strength and influence. She has an older sister Gwynesse, who was widowed by the Greyjoy Rebellion, and a younger brother Lord Rodrik Harlaw known as Rodrik the Reader. Her brother refers to her by the pet name "Lanny".
            Alannys was devastated by Theon being taken hostage and the deaths of her two eldest sons in the Greyjoy Rebellion, and began wandering the halls at night shrieking out their names. She had five ironborn boys brought to be fostered at Pyke after Ned Stark brought Theon to Winterfell including Tristifer Botley, a childhood love of Asha's.
            When her psychosis worsened, she left Pyke to retire to the Ten Towers, her family's seat on the island of Harlaw. Thus she is not present at Pyke when Theon returns to see his father. Asha briefly visits her mother before leaving to conquer Deepwood Motte in her part in Balon's invasion of the North. During the visit Alannys constantly asks about Theon, whom she thinks of as perpetually ten years old, his age when he was taken hostage. Asha feels she no longer knows her mother, though she is kind to her and answers her questions patiently.
            When Asha returns to the Iron Islands following her father's death, she cannot bring herself to tell her mother Theon is dead (as Asha incorrectly presumes). Asha meets Tristifer Botley at Ten Towers, who informs her that he still only loves Asha. He has asked and received Alannys's consent to marry Asha, though Asha rejects the proposal.
            Asha's uncle Rodrik Harlaw tells her that Alannys believes Balon was murdered. Asha muses "There were times when she [Alannys] would gladly have murdered him herself". It is unclear what Asha meant by that.
            Alannys has long white hair. She "never had the sort of beauty the singers cherished, but her daughter had loved her fierce strong face and the laughter in her eyes", although Asha now finds Alannys's eyes dim and cloudy.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Alannys_Greyjoy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemAlannysGreyjoy</string></dict>
        <key>Alicent Hightower</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.123.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alicent Hightower was a Queen of the Targaryen dynasty.
            Alicent Hightower was a queen of the Targaryen dynasty, the second wife to King Viserys I Targaryen and mother of his eldest son, Aegon II Targaryen. Throughout Viserys I's reign, tensions slowly mounted between Alicent's children and Viserys I's only surviving child by his first wife, his daughter Rhaenyra. Upon being informed of Viserys I's death, Alicent put the informant in the Black Cells to insure his silence. Ser Criston Cole, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, then summoned the Small Council, and Alicent's father Otto, the Hand of the King, set upon discussing the succession. The debate did not end till dawn when the Master of Coin declared this to be treason, which ended with him having his throat cut by Criston. Her son firstly rejected the Iron Throne, but was told by Alicent that Rhaenyra would kill him if she was to take her place. This rivalry exploded into the massive civil war between their two rival factions of House Targaryen, a conflict known as the Dance of the Dragons. When Rhaenyra ruled the Seven Kingdoms for half a year, the Small Council surrendered Alicent and Helaena Targaryen. The kingdoms were later took back by her son, however her youngest son, Aemond Targaryen and her only daughter had died as a result of the rebellion. Aegon would be succeeded by the son of Rhaenyra, Aegon III Targaryen.[1]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Alicent Hightower was in many ways the true leader of Aegon II's faction during the Dance of the Dragons.
            Alicent's father Otto Hightower had been Hand of the King in the last few years of the long reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. In 101 AL Otto brought the 15 year old Alicent to the royal court, where she cared for the aging king (who was left a broken shell after the recent death of his queen of many years, Alysanne). Jaehaerys died in 103 AL and was succeeded by his grandson Viserys I, who ruled for 26 years. Her father Otto remained as Hand of the King for Viserys I, and Otto's older brother in time succeeded as head of House Hightower. Viserys I's first queen, Aemma Arryn, only produced one living child before her death - a daughter, Rhaenyra. Viserys I then decided to remarry, but against the advice of some at court he chose the 18 year old Alicent to be his new queen. At first young Rhaenyra and Alicent got along well, but a rift grew between them as soon as Alicent produced her own children for Viserys I, and clearly wanted them to succeed to the throne instead of her. Alicent bore Viserys I four children: Aegon II, Aemond, Daeron the Daring, and Helaena (who became the sister-wife of Aegon II).
            Over the years of Viserys I's reign, despite his best efforts, a bitter rivalry grew between Alicent and Rhaenyra at court, as well as between their rival factions of supporters. Once at a great tournament Rhaenyra dressed in a bold black dress, from the colors of the Targaryen heraldry, while Alicent wore a green dress (the Hightower heraldry does not contain green, Alicent just happened to enjoy green dresses). Soon afterwards, their respective followers started dressing in similar colors and styles to display their political allegiance: Rhaenyra's faction (the "Princess's followers") wore black clothing styles, and Alicent's faction ("the Queen's followers") wore green clothing styles. Ultimately this inspired the nicknames for the two factions: "the Blacks and the Greens". The Blacks (Rhaenyra's supporters) included the Starks, Tullys, Arryns, Tarlys, and Velaryons (among others), while the Greens (Alicent's supporters) included the Hightowers and the Lannisters, among others. The Baratheons started out as Blacks but switched to the Greens when the civil war began, while the Tyrells may have been Greens at first but during the civil war itself declared themselves neutral.
            Aegon II himself grew to be a lazy, gluttonous, pouty man, prone to indulging his lusts with mistresses as well as prone to outburts of anger. Given that Aegon II had no great political skill, it was his mother Alicent who was seen as the true leader of his faction - he was not necessarily an outright puppet, however, as they shared the same goals (compare how Olenna Tyrell doesn't "manipulate" her grandson Loras Tyrell to goals he disagrees with, but Loras is just a fighter, while Olenna is the real political mastermind directing House Tyrell). The Dance of the Dragons was seen so much as a rivalry between Princess Rhaenyra and Queen Alicent that George R.R. Martin's prequel novella about the conflict was titled "The Princess and the Queen", referring to the two of them instead of to Aegon II.
            Viserys I publicly and repeatedly made the great lords of the realm swear oaths that Rhaenyra would succeed him on the Iron Throne, as the first Ruling Queen. A matter of hours after Viserys I died in his sleep, however, Alicent staged a coup - one that she had long been planning down to the fine details. Instead of announcing Viserys I's death immediately she called a Small Council meeting to discuss the succession. Of the seven man council (including her father Otto), all were Greens except for old Master of Coin Lyman Beesbury. Alicent soon made it clear that she intended to crown Aegon II, against her late husband's wishes. Now realizing that Alicent intended for her son to usurp the throne, Beesbury refused to go along with it. In response, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Criston Cole silently snuck up behind Beesbury's chair, and without a word slashed his throat. As the old man bled out onto the council table, the remaining council members seated around it (including Alicent) continued to plan out the next steps in their coup.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Alicent_Hightower</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemAlicentHightower</string></dict>
        <key>Manticores</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.124.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Manticores are highly aggressive and extremely venomous scorpion-like insects from the continent of Essos.
            Manticores originate from several tropical islands in the Jade Sea, in the distant east beyond Qarth.
            Manticore venom is one of the deadliest known poisons, however, and as a result manticores have been imported into the collections of assassins and alchemists across the world.  The city of Mantarys, east of the Free Cities and west of Slaver's Bay, is particularly noted as a producer of extracted manticore venom.[1]
            Manticores are physically similar to scorpions, but can grow almost as large as a lobster. They possess six legs and larger stinger-tail, which curves up over the body, hanging over the head. They have a series of threatening-looking spines on each body segment, running up the sides of the body and tail. They are mostly green in color, with an irridescent sheen.[2]
            Their most recognizable features are the designs on the plates of their bodies, particularly the marking on the final plate of their tails which resembles a human face. Because of this design they are also sometimes referred to as the "Death's Head Manticore".[3]
            Manticore venom is extremely lethal, and even a single sting is usually more than enough to kill a person. Extracted manticore venom is one of the most potent poisons used by the world's assassins: one usage is to coat bladed weapons with it so that even a single scratch will kill.[4]
            An agent of the Warlocks of Qarth attempts to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen using a manticore hidden inside a hollow wooden sphere. Before the creature can harm Daenerys with its lethal sting, Ser Barristan Selmy impales it with a dagger, killing it.[5]
            Grand Maester Pycelle and Qyburn assess that Oberyn Martell coated his spear with manticore venom prior to his duel with Ser Gregor Clegane. While Gregor won the duel by crushing Oberyn's head in, the poisoned wounds he took left him in agony, and he is now comatose. The effects of the poison are horrific, making the flesh around Gregor's wounds putrefy, which produces an overpowering stench. Pycelle regretfully tells Queen Cersei Lannister that Ser Gregor is beyond any hope of healing, but Qyburn insists that he can use the knowledge he has gained from unethical human experimentation to save Gregor's life. Cersei gives him permission to proceed, though he warns that the process will "change" Gregor.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, manticores are venomous insects from Essos, said to live on the jungle-filled islands of the Jade Sea, between Qarth and distant Asshai. They have a venomous sting that is fatal to humans and kills the instant it reaches the heart unless a clotting agent is used to thicken it and delay its fatal effects. Manticore venom is one of the deadliest poisons in the known world, and is highly sought after by alchemists, Maesters, and (most of all) assassins. Thus the insects have been imported into private collections across Essos and Westeros: Syrio Forel mentions that he saw one in a menagerie of exotic animals in Braavos, and Daenerys Targaryen sees a caged manticore in the market stalls of Vaes Dothrak.
            When treating Gregor Clegane, Qyburn theorizes that Oberyn used his extensive knowledge of poisons to add a clotting agent to the manticore venom he coated his spear with, thickening it in order to slow its progress through the veins towards the heart, dragging out Gregor's agony. This also explains why Oberyn didn't finish off Gregor when he had the chance: he never intended to give him the mercy of a quick death.
            Within the cultures of Westeros and Essos, the legendary manticore (after which the insect takes its name) is a chimeric creature with a human head, a lion's body, and a scorpion's tail. Dragonstone is adorned with gargoyles in the shape of manticores. A manticore is also the sigil of House Lorch.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Manticores</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemManticores</string></dict>
        <key>Dragons</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.125.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dragons are massive, flying reptiles which can breathe fire onto their enemies and cook their food with the same flame. They are rumored to have a strong connection to magic, which seems to be proven true when magic begins to return to the world after the birth of the first three in over two hundred years. Dragons possess awesome and devastating power, capable of laying waste to armies and burning entire cities to ashes. Men who were able to tame and ride dragons as beasts of war used them to burn their enemies and forge vast empires across the continents of Essos and Westeros.
            The last surviving dragons in the world were possessed by House Targaryen, who used them to conquer and unify the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros three hundred years before the War of the Five Kings. Most of the Targaryen dragons died in the Dance of the Dragons about a century and a half later, and after that, the only dragons the Targaryens were the size cats. Soon after the civil war ended, the last Targaryen dragons died, and the species was considered to be extinct throughout the world.
            At the same time that the War of the Five Kings began in Westeros, Daenerys Targaryen was in possession of three petrified dragons eggs. They were given to her as a wedding gift, still beautiful to look upon. However, she miraculously got the three new dragons to hatch from their eggs, and for the first time in generations, the unique sound of this lost species would be filling the skies of the world with the music of dragons once again.
            Dragons have long serpentine bodies, with proportionately long necks and tails. Their bodies have four limbs: two short back legs and two large wings as forelimbs, a body-plan similar to a bat. In later generations, after the dragons went extinct, physical descriptions of dragons became so confused in memory that artwork sometimes depicted them as having six limbs - two wings growing out of their backs in addition to four legs - but this is inaccurate. The teeth and claws of adult dragons are as long and sharp as swords.
            As reptiles, Dragons are covered in scales, as well as spiny horns which run down their backs from head to tail. Particularly large ridges of horns frame the edges of their faces, running along the back of the skull and along the jawline, which grow bigger as they mature. Adult dragons possess two sets of frills which run along the backs of their necks and spine, two along the sides of their necks and another two centered closer to the backbone, for a total of four frills. These are formed from webbing that grows between longer horny spines. When dragons are agitated (or simply excited), they raise and flare these frills - similar to how a furry animal like a cat will raise the hackles on its back when agitated (or a feathered animal such as a goose will puff up its feathers), in an attempt to appear bigger so as to intimidate its enemies.
            Dragons are also shown to have a variety of calls, from shrieking roars to low growls or hisses. They can even squeal.
            Dragons are obligate carnivores, with diets consisting entirely of meat. Dragons need to roast their prey with their fire-breath before consuming it. Dragons can eat almost any kind of meat, anything from sheep to fish. Historical dragons ridden as beasts of war were known to eat fallen horses and even men on the battlefield. Fully grown dragons could swallow a live horse whole.
            The scale color of dragons is highly variable, and historical dragons ranged in color from black to silver, red, gold, and even blue. Some dragons were one solid color throughout, but more often, they tend to have one primary color for most of their body, with highlights in a secondary color along their spinal crests, horns, and wing membranes. Confirmed markings observed so far include:
            In addition to the various scales hues observed between specimens, dragons also displayed eyes color variations. Dragons being reptiles, they had vertical slit pupils with colored irises. Drogon had red eyes while his brother, Viserion had green eyes.
            Probably the most famous attribute of dragons is their ability to breathe fire. Dragon flame can turn flesh to ash, melt steel, and crack stone. Older dragons can produce more intense flame for longer duration. Dragons seem to produce their fire-breath by expelling chemicals out of two tubes in the back of their throats: when these volatile substances combine, they undergo an intense reaction which bursts into a directed jet of fire. The bodies of dragons are also very resistant to fire, particularly their own flames, which don't even damage their own mouths as they expel them. Some believe that in many ways dragons are fire, fire given form as flesh: it is said that "fire cannot kill a dragon".
            Like most reptiles, dragons lay clutches of eggs. Dragon eggs are roughly the size of a human child's head, and as heavy as stone, so they need to be carried with two hands. The outer shell is covered in scales, with vastly different color patterns between eggs, usually matching the color of the dragon inside. Dragon eggs are notoriously difficult to hatch, though they can maintain the spark of life inside of them for decades if not centuries. The secret key to hatching the eggs seems to involve some form of blood magic: as the House words of the Targaryens hint, it requires "fire and blood". To hatch them, dragon eggs must be burned in roaring flames, with which another creature is simultaneously being burned alive - a life in exchange for a life. In the wild this might just be a prey animal that the parent dragon kills, but human sacrifice will do the trick quite nicely, particularly if there is more than one egg to hatch.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dragons</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemDragons</string></dict>
        <key>Shadowcats</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.126.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shadowcats are a large feline apex predator found in Westeros.
            Shadowcats are found in northern Westeros, with larger populations in the lightly inhabited forests of the lands beyond the Wall.[1] However, they are not limited to the lands of the North above the Neck. They are frequently found in wild mountainous areas, with particularly large populations of Shadowcats in the inaccessible areas of the Mountains of the Moon in the Vale of Arryn. They are a frequent danger for travelers on the Eastern Road, crossing over the mountains into the Vale.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Shadowcats have no direct analogue to any real-life species of Big Cat, although they are not quite as remarkable as direwolves. Author George R.R. Martin has stated that while Shadowcats are bigger than cougars, they are not as big as tigers. Shadowcats have thick black fur with white stripes.
            Shadowcats are apparently not as large as lions either. Lions used to inhabit much of Westeros, particularly the hills of the Westerlands, but they were hunted practically to the point of extinction by humans in recent centuries. At one point it is lamented that large animals like direwolves and lions have been pushed out of most of Westeros by human encroachment, which would indicate that Shadowcats aren't as large as lions.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Shadowcats</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemShadowcats</string></dict>
        <key>Direwolves</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.127.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Direwolves are an unusually large and intelligent species of wolf. A grey direwolf on a white field is the sigil of House Stark.
            Direwolves are held to be near-mythical in most of the south of Westeros. Inhabitants of the North acknowledge that they are a real animal, but they are very rarely encountered there. There are some rumors of them living in the Wolfswood near Winterfell, but these are unconfirmed. There may have been larger direwolf populations in the North in past millennia, but centuries of human encroachment on their territory have pushed their range back to the furthest north.
            There have been confirmed sightings north of the Wall by the Night's Watch who guard it. The wildlings who live beyond the Wall claim that direwolves can be found in greater numbers in the Haunted Forest to the north of the Wall. By the reign of King Robert Baratheon, no direwolf had been sighted south of the Wall - even in the Stark lands of the North - in over 200 years.
            After Eddard Stark sentences Will to death for deserting the Night's Watch and carries out the execution, he heads back to Winterfell along with his sons Robb and Bran, his "bastard" son Jon Snow and his adolescent ward Theon Greyjoy. On their journey, they encounter a stag dead in the road, partially disemboweled. Looking for what killed it, they find a dead female direwolf, with an antler piece broken off in her throat. The female died after giving birth, and her five pups huddle by the corpse for warmth. Theon advocates killing the pups, but Jon Snow convinces his father that this is an omen: the direwolf is the symbol of House Stark, and Eddard has five trueborn children. With Bran looking on beseechingly, Eddard agrees that his children can have the pups, but only if they raise them themselves with no help from the servants. Just as the party leaves, Jon finds a sixth pup, an albino runt of the litter. Theon mockingly points out that this one belongs to Jon. Further adding to the speculation that the event is an omen is the fact that the pups are revealed to be four males and two females, the same as the Stark children (including Jon).
            When Eddard Stark travels South to King's Landing to serve as Hand of the King, he brings his daughters Sansa and Arya along with their pet Direwolves, Lady and Nymeria. These are the first Direwolves to be seen so far south in hundreds of years. After Nymeria attacks Prince Joffrey, Arya drives her away to escape execution for attacking the Prince; in her place, Lady is killed by Lord Eddard on the command of Robert. Nymeria has been traveling the Riverlands ever since where she leads a pack of gray wolves.
            The other direwolves remained with their masters until they were killed, with the exception of Jon's direwolf Ghost, who is still alive and by Jon's side, but who left him for a period of time when Jon was north of the Wall to explore his natural habitat.
            An adult direwolf is as large as a small horse, and can rip a man's arm from its socket. Even a juvenile direwolf is quite capable of killing a man by ripping out his throat. Physically, they are not simply larger versions of wolves, but have slightly different proportions than their smaller cousins; their heads are larger with a leaner, more pronounced muzzle, their legs are longer in proportion to their body, and they have proportionately larger teeth that are often used to crush bones.
            Direwolves can give birth to litters of at least six pups.
            Direwolves are loyal to their masters and will attack anyone who threatens them. Arya Stark's direwolf Nymeria attacked Prince Joffrey after he threatened her with a sword, while Bran Stark's Summer killed a would-be assassin in Bran's bedroom.[1] They will also come to the aid of those they know are loyal to their masters, since Ghost defended Samwell Tarly and Gilly, both friends of Jon Snow, from Night's Watch bullies, and later prepared to fight alongside Ser Davos Seaworth, Eddison Tollett and a handful of Jon's loyal brothers against the Night's Watch mutineers who betrayed and murdered Jon not long before.
            At the Battle of Oxcross during the War of the Five Kings, Robb Stark's direwolf Grey Wind plays a vital part in Robb's victory, killing several Lannister sentries and panicking their horses.[2] During the Battle of Castle Black, Ghost killed numerous wildlings, among them at least one Thenn.
            The six children of Lord Eddard Stark adopted six orphaned direwolf cubs found in the Wolfswood. They are as follows:
            The name dire wolf (Latin: ​Canis dirus​) is given to an actual species of Pleistocene megafauna that once existed on real-life Earth, like the mammoth and sabertooth cat. Dire wolves inhabited the Americas, from 1.8 million years ago to about 10,000 years ago.
            Note that the name of the real-life animal is spelled as two words, "dire wolf", but that the name in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels is consistently spelled as one word, "direwolf".
            The large Pleistocene mammals went extinct when the last ice age ended, roughly 10,000 years ago. Large herbivores such as mammoths died out due to climate change (and possibly hunting by prehistoric humans), and carnivores such as dire wolves died when their food sources disappeared. Dire wolves and mammoths were adapted to the cold ice age climate, their size maximizing heat retention and strength but at the cost of speed. In the warmer climate following the ice age, smaller but faster animals thrived that didn't need to make these tradeoffs for cold weather. Not only did dire wolves' old large prey such as mammoths die out, but they were being out-competed by smaller and faster grey wolves. Dire wolves, however, were not the largest wolves. Currently extant subspecies the Yukon wolf (Canis lupus pambasileus) and the Northwestern wolf (Canis lupus occidentals) were approximately the same size as the dire wolf.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Direwolves</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemDirewolves</string></dict>
        <key>Ravens</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.128.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ravens are a species of large, black-feathered birds native to Westeros.
            Ravens are uncommonly intelligent animals that can be trained to serve as messengers. They can fly great distances at speed, and are used by the maesters of Westeros to pass messages between the castles and cities of the Seven Kingdoms. Through complex training methods, the maesters are able to send messages from almost any castle in Westeros to any other.
            Although most messages brought by ravens are standard and innocuous, they are also linked to ominous tidings, giving rise to the phrase "Dark wings, dark words".
            There is also a cleverer but much rarer species of white raven, which the Conclave of the maesters dispatch from their headquarters at the Citadel in Oldtown only when they agree that the season has turned. This happen in 299 AL, when Summer turned into Autumn, and then again in 303 AL, where winter had officially come.[1]
            Live ravens are used in most shots in which the animals appear in cages, though more complex shots of them flying around often need to use CGI ravens. The rare white raven which Pycelle presented to the Small Council in Season 2 had to be brought in all the way from Austria.[2]
            In the books the messenger-ravens of Westeros often replicate simple human speech in the manner of parrots. Real-life ravens can actually do this, they just aren't coaxed to do it as frequently as pet parrots are. As opposed to parrots, which have high-pitched voices, real-life ravens have a much deeper vocal range and can thus (if given sufficient training) make surprisingly accurate replications of human speech. It is also stated that ravens can speak the "True Tongue", the language of the Children of the Forest, a tongue no human can speak.
            The white ravens used by the maesters of the Citadel are not albinos, but a separate sub-species bred and maintained by the Citadel. This is evidenced by the fact that their eyes are black, not red as in albino animals. White ravens are larger and generally more intelligent than normal ravens, thus why they are bred and used for only the most important messages, particularly notification that the erratic years-long seasons are changing.
            King Baelor Targaryen, in one of his pious delusions, tried to replace all the messenger ravens with doves, but this was unsuccessful. Maester Aemon says at one point that while doves or pigeons can be trained to carry messages, the maesters don't use them because ravens are larger and more clever: they have the physical strength to fly longer distances as well as the intellectual capacity to accurately remember the longer path they must take; they are also able to fend off attacks from hawks much better than smaller doves or pigeons can.
            Ravens and crows are both members of the genus Corvus in real life, but a raven is not a kind of crow. In-universe, Maester Aemon says that "the crow is the raven's poor cousin". There are several differences distinguishing them: ravens are somewhat larger (almost the size of hawks) and have larger bills; crows have a more rounded tail, ravens have a more pointed tail; crows make a high-pitched "caw" sound, while ravens make a low "croak" sound; crows live around 8 years, while ravens can live for 30 years. The collective noun for a group of crows is "a murder of crows", but the collective noun for a group of ravens is actually "an unkindness of ravens" (alternatively, "conspiracy"). Both crows and ravens will eat corpses on a battlefield, but euphemistically "crows" are more often spoken of as carrion-eaters, i.e. that a battle will make "a feast for crows".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ravens</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemRavens</string></dict>
        <key>Lizard-lions</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.129.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lizard-lions are large carnivorous reptiles that live in the bogs and swamps of the Neck in Westeros. House Reed, the ruling house of the Crannogmen, employ as their sigil a black lizard-lion on a grey-green field.[1]
            Lizard-lions are only found in the swamps of the Neck, the narrow isthmus that connects the North to the rest of Westeros.
            Lizard-lions are semi-aquatic reptiles, so-named because they grow to the size of Lions and, like them, are carnivorous.
            Lizard-lions have also been known to attack unwary men who wander through the marshes and bogs of the Neck.
            The Lizard-lion is the sigil of House Reed, a noble house of crannogmen that rules the Neck as vassals of House Stark.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, lizard-lions are the only species of crocodilian known to inhabit the entire continent of Westeros - it is unknown if similar species exist in the other continents. Like their real-life analogues, they are ambush predators that hunt by lying entirely still in the water, resembling floating logs.
            Exactly what kind of crocodilian lizard-lions are supposed to represent is unknown: for some time it was unknown if names such as "crocodile", "alligator", or "caiman" exist in their fictional world.  Therefore it was unclear if "Lizard-lion" was simply their in-universe term for "crocodile", or a unique fictional variant of possibly much larger size.  Author George R.R. Martin has stated that not every species of animal in Westeros has a direct one-for-one equivalent to a real-life species of animal. For example, Martin said that shadowcats have no direct real-life analogue: they are larger than cougars (mountain lions) but smaller than tigers, and don't look quite like either.
            The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014) answered this by referring to both "lizard-lions" in the Neck and "crocodiles" in Sothoryos.  Thus "lizard-lion" isn't simply their term for "crocodiles".  It's possible that lizard-lions are larger than regular crocodile much as direwolves are larger than common wolves - or like shadowcats, they could just be a fantasy variant of other crocodilians.
            Another species of large reptile exists in the jungles of Yi Ti in eastern Essos, known as "basilisks", apparently roughly dog-sized and venomous. Many have been imported to Qarth or Slaver's Bay where they are set against dogs in fighting pits for entertainment. They may be only distantly related to lizard-lions.
            In the first book, as the Stark-Baratheon caravan passes south over the Neck, corresponding to the episode "The Kingsroad", Arya Stark says that she hopes to see a lizard-lion. In the second book, when Meera and Jojen Reed join Bran Stark, Bran is curious about lizard-lions and asks them what they are like, as they don't live in the cold regions north of the swamps.
            Legends about the Marsh Kings of the crannogmen during the Age of Heroes say that they actually rode lizard-lions as mounts, though these are generally dismissed as mere legends.  This may be a distorted memory, however, of skinchangers among the crannogmen magically controlling lizard-lions with their minds.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lizard-lions</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemLizardlions</string></dict>
        <key>Mammoths</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.130.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mammoths are a larger, hairier relatives of elephants. They are the only species of elephant native to Westeros.
            Mammoths inhabit the sub-arctic tundras in the far north of the lands Beyond the Wall. They do not venture as far south as the densely wooded Haunted Forest close to the Wall, and as a result they are rarely seen by the Night's Watch.
            Mammoths have a general body plan similar to elephants, though they possess several distinct features, comparable to the difference between direwolves and regular wolves. Adapted for cold climates, mammoths are covered in long, woolly fur. They are much larger and stronger than regular elephants, and possess disproportionately long, curved tusks, which they can effectively use to combat threats. Mammoths stand a little over 20 feet tall, and are about 15 feet wide and nearly 20 feet long.
            Mammoths are used as mounts by the race of Giants, who inhabit the same range of territory far north of the Wall. The size proportion between a giant and a mammoth is similar to that between a normal man and a horse. The giants have not domesticated mammoths, but have been able to tame large numbers of them. Giants use mammoths as war mounts, though they can also be used as beasts of burden.
            Because no one knows exactly what prehistoric mammoths sounded like, the mammoth roar sound effects used in the TV series were created by using elephant roars combined with other sounds from bears, walruses, and camels. The sounds were tweaked and blended together in various ways to create the different vocalizations.[1]
            From Inside HBO's Game of Thrones: Seasons 3 &amp; 4, pages 178-179, "Creating the Mammoths and Giants":
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, mammoths are ridden as mounts by the giants who live beyond the Wall. The Giants in the novels are very different, inspired by Bigfoot/Sasquatch legends. Covered in shaggy fur themselves, the giants in the books wear no clothing and possess no more advanced technology than wielding logs as clubs (or at most, tying rocks at the end of a club to make a massive, crude but effective maul). The giants' taming of mammoths as mounts is one of their most advanced cultural/technological achievements.
            In the books, Jon Snow actually first saw both mammoths and giants at the same time, when he first entered the main wildling army camp under Mance Rayder: a large column of giants was riding into camp at the time, atop their mammoths. The TV series omitted this (probably for budgetary reasons) and only showed a single giant - but hinting at this detail from the books, the giant is seen constructing a tent out of massive mammoth bones.
            Elephants are fairly common in the warmer parts of Essos, and have been seen in both Slaver's Bay and the southern Free Cities. War elephants are uncommon but not unheard of: The Golden Company possesses its own contingent of war elephants. Volantis, the southernmost Free City, makes extensive use of elephants, as well as using a species of dwarf elephant as both a beast of burden and common means of transport to pull carts, much like horses.
            Mammoths are also said to inhabit the icy wastes of the island of Ibben, far north of mainland Essos. It does not appear that mammoths live anywhere on mainland Essos.
            Nonetheless, mammoths appear to be the only species of pachyderm native to Westeros itself - making such huge beasts even more exotic and impressive to the men of the Night's Watch when they encounter them.
            The mammoths in the narrative are essentially similar to the real-life Pleistocene megafauna Mammoths that once existed on real-life Earth. They first evolved about 5 million years ago and spread across both North America and Eurasia. Like real-life Direwolves, however, they died out at the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago.
            The large Pleistocene mammals went extinct when the last ice age ended: large herbivores like the mammoth died out due to climate change, possibly also combined with hunting by prehistoric humans (humans did hunt mammoths, but how much of a role this played in their overall extinction is debated). Mammoths, like dire wolves, grew to large size as an adaptation for maximizing heat retention, which made them stronger but slower than modern elephants.
            For a time, real-life mammoths did inhabit the same areas as real-life dire wolves (who only inhabited North America), just as both direwolves and mammoths inhabit the same area beyond the Wall in Westeros. Real-life dire wolf packs preyed on mammoths, but there have been no explicit descriptions of this occurring in the narrative (mammoths may be very rare and isolated at this point in Westeros's history).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mammoths</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemMammoths</string></dict>
        <key>Basilisks</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.131.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Basilisks are a kind of carnivorous reptile, native to the jungles in the southern regions of far eastern Essos. Basilisks are venomous, and Basilisk venom is a notable poison used in assassinations.[1] Even Basilisk's blood is poisonous.[2]The species probably give the name to the Basilisk Isles, where they can be found in.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, basilisks are large, roughly dog-sized venomous reptiles that live in the jungles of Yi Ti, far to the southeast of the Dothraki Sea, across the Bone Mountains. They may also infest the tropical Basilisk Isles off the northern coast of Sothoryos, and also on tropical islands of the Jade Sea (which Yi Ti is on the northwest coast of), the same islands where poisonous Manticore insects are also found.
            While wild basilisks originated in Yi Ti (and possibly other regions around the Jade Sea), they became a very popular animal for use in Fighting pits throughout Essos, made to fight other animals as entertainment. Thus they have been imported into many animal menageries across Essos. When Daenerys Targaryen passes through Qarth she sees a basilisk tearing apart a dog in a fighting pit; they are probably also found in the popular fighting pits in Slaver's Bay.
            Exactly what a basilisk looks like is unclear, or if it is even meant to be analogous to a specific kind of real-life reptile. Because basilisks have been seen set against dogs in fighting pits they would seem to be roughly dog-sized, and therefore smaller than the massive Lizard-lions founds in the swamps of the Neck in Westeros. Due to their relative size and possession of poison, they may be somewhat like Komodo dragons - though they may be more like snakes for all we know.
            The novels have at different points said that both "Basilisk venom" and "Basilisk blood" is poisonous: they might simply both be poisonous.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Basilisks</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemBasilisks</string></dict>
        <key>Nagga</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.132.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the legendary Nagga was said to be so immense that it fed on massive Krakens and drowned islands when it was angered.
            It has never been established that "sea dragons" were ever real creatures. In a world where dragons once stalked the skies, there may be some kernel of truth behind the legends, which were later exaggerated to make Nagga big enough to drown entire islands. On the other hand, "Nagga's Bones", the ruins of the Grey King's old hall, still exist and were used as the site where kingsmoots were held to elect the new King of the Iron Islands (before the kingship became hereditary). Descriptions of Nagga's Bones are vague: according to legend it was made using the massive bones of Nagga as pillars, but the narration doesn't make it clear if these are just pillars of rock that resemble bones, or if "Nagga's Bones" actually are the remaining fossilized bones of some immense animal. Damphair refers to Nagga as the first sea dragon, and that the Drowned God turned her bones to stone.
            When spelled with a single "g", naga refers to a race of serpentine creatures from the Indian sub-continent. Appearing in both Hindu and Buddhist tradition, nagas are associated with both water (similar to Nagga) and the Underworld.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Nagga</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherFemNagga</string></dict>
