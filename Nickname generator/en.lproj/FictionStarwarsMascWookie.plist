        <key>Attichitcuk</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Attichitcuk was the father of the Wookiee Chewbacca, who when introducing himself to Han Solo, referred to himself as "Chewbacca, son of Attichitcuk."[1] He and Chewbacca's mother lived in the city of Rwookrrorro on the planet Kashyyyk.[2]
            Attichitcuk was first mentioned in Star Wars canon in the 2018 Star Wars Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story. In the film, Chewbacca mentions him in Shyriiwook, though his name was annotated in the screenplay.[3] Joe Schreiber's junior novelization of the film, presents the conversation translated to Galactic Basic so the reader can understand what Chewbacca says to Han.[1]
            In Star Wars Legends, Attichitcuk, then known as "Itchy", was created by George Lucas for The Star Wars Holiday Special, a variety show aired by CBS on November 17, 1978, where he was played by actor Paul Gale.[4]
            Attichutcuk's appearance was designed by Joe Johnston, who had worked as head storyboard artist on the Star Wars original trilogy. In his conceptual drawings, Johnston described Attichitcuk as a "350-375 years old" Wookiee. Many of Attichitcuk's characteristics can also be attributed to Ralph McQuarrie, who recalled drawing "an old Wookiee getting up out of his chair and several females and children".[5]
            Around October 2002, Attichitcuk was to be reinvented during production of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the prequel trilogy's conclusion. According to concept artist Sang Jun Lee, "Chewbacca's father" was meant to be killed during the course of the movie, which would have prompted Chewie to run away and meet Han Solo. This concept, however, didn't make it into the final film. In January 2003, Lucas told the creation team that a young Han Solo would be featured and that by the time of Episode III, he was being raised on Kashyyyk by Chewbacca. Eventually, both ideas were utterly abandoned.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Attichitcuk</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascAttichitcuk</string></dict>
        <key>Bacca</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.2.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bacca, often remembered as the Great Bacca, was a male Wookiee from Kashyyyk who lived centuries prior to the Old Sith Wars era. He was famed for crafting a ceremonial sword that came to symbolize leadership among his people. Many centuries after his death, Bacca's lineage was still alive through the family of Attichitcuk and his son Chewbacca.
            The Wookiee male known as Bacca was born on Kashyyyk several centuries before the Old Sith Wars. He originated from Rwookrrorro, the capital city of his people, and his name meant into as "ally" or "friend" in Shyriiwook, the main Wookiee language. At some point when Bacca had already grown old, he discovered a crashed starship during an expedition in the Nother World. That encounter marked the first time a Wookiee realized that life existed outside of Kashyyyk. Bacca scavenged metallic debris from the wreckage and used it to craft a vibroblade. That weapon, which came to be known as Bacca's Ceremonial Blade, became the symbol of Wookiee independence. Bacca himself rose to become the first great Wookiee Chieftain.[1]
            Following Bacca's death, his Ceremonial Blade was passed down from chieftain to chieftain as a symbol of leadership. At some point, Bacca's descendant Rothrrrawr raided the Nother World, hoping to defeat a vicious terentatek called the Great Beast in a ritual combat. However, the ambitious warrior only managed to wound the beast, breaking off the blade inside the creature's hide. He fled only with the hilt of the blade, which continued to be passed down through the generations. A generation later, in 3956 BBY, the blade was finally recovered by Revan and put back together with its handle.[1]
            The name of Bacca was also carried with many Wookiees after him, marking them as descendants of his prestigious lineage. Those individuals included members of Attichitcuk's family such as Chewbacca[2] and his nephew Lowbacca,[3] and others like Kybacca[4] and Weebacca.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bacca</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascBacca</string></dict>

            Yarua first appeared in the 1999 movie Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, the first installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yarua</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascYarua</string></dict>
        <key>Chewbacca</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.4.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Chewbacca, known affectionately to his friends as Chewie, was a Wookiee warrior, smuggler, and resistance fighter who fought in the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, and the conflict between the First Order and the Resistance. He hailed from the planet Kashyyyk and became a Wookiee military leader. During the Clone Wars, he was captured by Trandoshan slavers and held captive on Wasskah, but he worked with a fellow captive, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, to escape. He later commanded Wookiee forces during the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside the Grand Army of the Republic, led by Jedi Master Yoda. During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Yoda's clone troopers received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and, with the help of Chewbacca, Yoda escaped Kashyyyk and the destruction of the Jedi Order.
            In the years that followed, during the rule of the Galactic Empire, Chewbacca became a smuggler and the co-pilot of Captain Han Solo aboard the Millennium Falcon. They worked in the employ of crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure until Solo was forced to dump a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, at which point a bounty was placed on their heads. Soon thereafter, Chewbacca and Solo were hired by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to ferry him, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 to Alderaan on a mission vital to the survival of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After finding Alderaan was destroyed, the group was brought aboard the Death Star, where they helped Princess Leia Organa escape from captivity and return to the Rebel base on Yavin 4. Though Chewbacca and Solo initially chose to leave Yavin 4 and not join the Rebellion, they ended up fighting in the Battle of Yavin and were instrumental in Skywalker's destruction of the Death Star, a major victory for the Rebellion.
            Throughout the war, Chewbacca and Solo fought the Empire in a number of engagements, including an assault on Cymoon 1 and the battle on Vrogas Vas. Along with Princess Organa and C-3PO, they escaped from Echo Base on the planet Hoth after the Empire tracked the Rebel Alliance there. The group sought refuge with Lando Calrissian, an old friend of Solo's, on Cloud City, but Calrissian betrayed them and turned them over to Darth Vader, the Emperor's chief enforcer, after his city was threatened. Solo was frozen in carbonite and Calrissian helped the others escape, but they were too late to save the frozen Solo from being taken by Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Chewbacca and Calrissian set off to find Solo and located him in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, where Chewbacca and his friends saved Solo and destroyed Jabba. Shortly thereafter, they fought in the Battle of Endor, where Chewbacca helped destroy the shield generator and allowed the Alliance Fleet to destroy the Death Star II. The Emperor was killed aboard the battle station, delivering a crippling blow to the Empire.
            After Endor and the rise of the New Republic, Chewbacca and Solo fought to liberate Kashyyyk from the Empire. When the war finally came to a close, Chewbacca returned home to Kashyyyk with his family. After Solo's son Ben, turned to the dark side and destroyed Skywalker's new generation of Jedi, Chewbacca reunited with his old friend and the two spent many years as smugglers once more. They lost the Millennium Falcon and ended up smuggling aboard a ship called the Eravana, but they eventually found the Falcon and, with it, stowaways named Rey, Finn, and the droid BB-8. The droid had part of a map that led to the exiled Luke Skywalker, so the group brought the map to the Resistance that opposed the First Order, which had risen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Chewbacca soon fought in the assault to destroy Starkiller Base, a devastating First Order superweapon, a conflict in which Solo lost his life at the hands of his son. After the base was destroyed, Chewbacca joined Rey in traveling to the planet Ahch-To on the Falcon, where they found Luke Skywalker. After Solo's death, Chewbacca often served as the sole pilot of the Falcon, including piloting the ship to aid the Resistance during the Battle of Crait.
            A Wookiee male, Chewbacca hailed from Kashyyyk,[14] a peaceful planet where he was born in the city of Rwookrrorro[15] one hundred and eighty years before the Clone Wars[16] to Attichitcuk and a female Wookiee.[15] He was married to a female named Mallatobuck, and had a family to support,[17] including a son named Lumpawaroo.[18]
            During the galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists, Chewbacca was captured by a Trandoshan hunting guild led by Garnac; taken to Island Four on Wasskah to be their prey, his transport was attacked by a trio of Jedi apprentices—the Padawan Ahsoka Tano and the younglings Jinx and O-Mer, also prey of the Trandoshans.[19]
            Chewbacca escaped from the wreckage and followed the trio (with whom he communicated with thanks to Tano's understanding of Shyriiwook) to their hideout. Using his technical expertise and parts from the crashed transport, he constructed a transmitter to contact his people on his nearby homeworld; however, it seemingly failed and an impatient Jinx, supported by O-Mer, decided to lure down and hijack a hunting pod and take the base ship. As persuaded by Tano, Chewbacca joined in their endeavor and raided the Trandoshan base, only to be joined by a Wookiee relief force led by General Tarfful—who had received Chewbacca's transmission—as well as bounty hunters Sugi and Seripas. Once all the Trandoshans had been killed, Chewbacca and the Wookiees accompanied the young Jedi to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where they parted ways.[19]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chewbacca</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascChewbacca</string></dict>
        <key>Chorrawl</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.5.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Chorrawl was a Wookiee hunter who lived during the Jedi Civil War. When he first met an amnesiac Revan, who came to Kashyyyk in search of a Star Map, he misjudged the Jedi as just another Czerka slaver because he was a Human. Later, Revan retrieved the blade of the great Bacca's sword and gave it to ex-chieftain Freyyr, who had been exiled by Chuundar, Freyyr's son. When Freyyr came back to Rwookrrorro with this important artifact to challenge Chuundar, Chorrawl sided with Freyyr. He helped to overthrow Chuundar and return Freyyr to his rightful place as chieftain.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chorrawl</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascChorrawl</string></dict>
        <key>Chuundar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.6.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Chuundar was a Wookiee chieftain and the son of chieftain Freyyr, and the brother of Zaalbar. Chuundar was born a runt on the planet Kashyyyk. After his brother, Zaalbar, was exiled from Kashyyyk for being a madclaw, Chuundar seized power from his father over the Wookiee tribe. He was involved in secretly selling fellow Wookiees to the Czerka Corporation as slaves.
            When Zaalbar, accompanied by Revan and his companions, arrived on Kashyyyk, Chuundar imprisoned his brother for not honoring his exile. Chuundar asked Revan to kill an enraged Wookiee exile in the Shadowlands beneath the planet's mighty trees, which, upon further investigation, turned out to be Freyyr. Revan helped Freyyr retrieve Bacca's Ceremonial Blade, a mighty and sacred sword for the Wookiees, and then led a revolt against Chuundar and Czerka. Chuundar refused to step down and was killed in the subsequent fighting.
            Chuundar was created by David Falkner, Steve Gilmour, Casey Hudson, Drew Karpyshyn, James Ohlen, Preston Watamaniuk, and Derek Watts, and first appeared in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.
            Depending on which side of the Force the player is on, light or dark, they also have the option to side with Chuundar and kill Freyyr, possibly losing Zaalbar as a party member but you can reason with him to stay with you. If the dark side option is chosen, the Wookiee village, Rwookrrorro is sealed off from the player.
            Chuundar's bowcaster is a unique model equipped with Czerka modifications, and it is one of the spoils of the battle if the player kills Chuundar.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chuundar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascChuundar</string></dict>
        <key>Chalmun</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.7.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Chalmun was a male Wookiee proprietor of the most popular spacer's bar in Mos Eisley, Tatooine, the eponymous Chalmun's cantina. A distant relative of Chewbacca, he was a large tan-and-gray Wookiee, with a scar running from his left shoulder across the left side of his chest. This was a remnant of his days as a street thug.
            Chalmun was a beige and gray-colored Wookiee born on Kashyyyk in 157 BBY,[1] and a distant relative of Chewbacca,[3] a famous Wookiee who became a member of the Rebel Alliance.[4] Chalmun grew up as a street thug, quickly learning that his natural stature and weight as a Wookiee gave him a distinct advantage in brawls; however, he also learned first-hand that strength meant little when one was faced with a blaster.[1]
            At some point in his life, Chalmun was badly scarred, with a diagonal scar running from his left shoulder across the left side of his chest.[1] Chalmun was a street fighter for a long time before he ran up a huge profit swindling hapless tourists at the casinos on Ord Mantell in just a few years. He used the funds to purchase a popular cantina—known simply as the Mos Eisley cantina—from two Ranats, the Vriichon brothers, located in the heart of Mos Eisley, largest city on the planet Tatooine in the Outer Rim Territories.[5]
            The Vriichons left Tatooine post haste after the sale—they had been using the cantina as a front for an illegal spice den, and were afraid that the Wookiee would be angry with them when he discovered the numerous bodies they had buried in the building's base. The cantina, which quickly became known as "Chalmun's Cantina"[5] or simply "Chalmun's,"[3] was extremely popular with smugglers, spacers, pilots and various other shady individuals, because of its central location, wide variety of beverages, and loose rules:[1] while fighting was banned and rowdy individuals sometimes ejected,[6] the rules were rarely enforced, so muggings and shootings were commonplace.[5]
            Chalmun became loyal to his regulars, and any who treated them poorly were swiftly kicked out. He also abhorred droids, refusing them entry in his cantina.[1] Chalmun rarely worked personally in the bar, instead employing bartenders such as Wuher and Ackmena to serve drinks; he spent most of his time in his office, which contained his own personal bar, tended by Nimbanel barman Husklf. Chalmun also employed security for the cantina, who used a complex listening system to eavesdrop on conversations,[5] and a bouncer named Tork.[6] He kept a personal pilot and escape ship, ready to flee the cantina should the need arise.[5]
            Since coming to own the cantina, he had distanced himself from the kinds of situations that had provoked the violence he so enjoyed in his youth. However, he often provided his hospitality to beings associated with the Hutts and retired celebrity podracers.
            Despite this, Chalmun was rarely seen in the main cantina; instead spending the majority of the time in his back office. Many who saw the Wookiee there mistook him for a bouncer, owing both to his formidable appearance and his tendency to physically remove anyone who caused trouble. Of course, owing to his history, he also admired people who caused trouble with style, which also meant that making friends with him was a tightrope walk.
            Chalmun remained the owner of the cantina when it was visited by Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, and Chewbacca shortly before the Battle of Yavin.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chalmun/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascChalmun</string></dict>
        <key>Harrgun</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.8.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Harrgun was a male Wookiee who was killed during the liberation of the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Harrgun</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascHarrgun</string></dict>
        <key>Black Krrsantan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.9.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Black Krrsantan, also known as "Santy", was a male Wookiee bounty hunter during the Galactic Civil War. He was a regular bounty hunter for the crime lord Jabba the Hutt and was hired by Darth Vader to track down and capture an agent of the Emperor.
            Early in his life, Black Krrsantan disgraced his people. Krrsantan was keen to flee Kashyyyk because of this and he learnt that an acquisition crew, that captured aliens for the Xonti Brothers, was coming to Kashyyyk. Krrsantan set a trap for them by leaving an unconscious Wookiee as bait. When the five Trandoshans took the bait, Krrsantan opened fired on them, killing one of the slavers. The others opened fired and Krrsantan gunned down two more of them, pinning down the last two, Noka and Kootan. Kootan attempted to kill Krrsantan when the Wookiee swung at him and threw him into a tree, killing the Trandoshan on impact. Krrsantan stood over Noka and ordered the slaver to take him to the Xonti Brothers. Noka put him with the other four aliens he had captured, a Talz, a Herglic, a Gamorrean and a Dowutin.[4]
            Noka took them to the Xonti Brothers, who were surprised the Wookiee had volunteered. Krrsantan soon realized he chose wrong when they put him through harsh training against his will to be a gladiator. The five candidates were pushed and pushed and the Xonti Brothers started picking them off. The Talz fell first to a sarlacc. Then the Gamorrean was killed by a large monster. The Herglic fell later to a swarm of robotic insects. This left Krrsantan and the Dowutin. The Xonti Brothers altered the wookiee's knuckles by filling them with metal to make them better when punching. Krrsantan tested it on the Dowutin and knocked it unconscious in one punch. He was then auctioned to the highest bidder. Krrsantan swore to affect the Xonti Brothers in the same way they had affected him.[4]
            Sometime later, Krrsantan became a bounty hunter for the crime lord Jabba the Hutt who resided on the desert planet Tatooine.[1] In 10 BBY, Krrsantan was hired by Jabba to track down the man who stopped his water tax.[5] He went to the location of the attack in the Dune Sea with Pagetti Rook and a Klatooinian guard. Krrsantan went to the moisture farm nearby and took Owen Lars hostage. Krrsantan then made Lars scream. He then saw the man, "Ben" Kenobi appear behind him. He was given a chance to leave by Kenobi. Krrsantan fought Kenobi, choking him and trapping him with a stun net. Lars fought back against Krrsantan but was easily knocked aside. Kenobi used the Force to cause rocks to hit Krrsantan and save Lars from falling. He then tried to kill Kenobi with a rock. Krrsantan was briefly blinded and scarred by Kenobi's lightsaber. He tried to shoot Kenobi with his electrified net gun, but it was destroyed. Krrsantan then punched and tried to kill Kenobi, as Kenobi attempted to rescue Lars. He continued trying to kill him with his bowcaster until he fell off the side of a cliff. Krrsantan then fled Tatooine, knowing that Jabba would be incensed at his failure.[1]
            Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader traveled to Tatooine on a mission to negotiate on behalf of the Galactic Empire for supplies with Jabba. Vader also used the opportunity to take on a personal mission, and he requested two bounty hunters from Jabba. The Hutt provided his two best bounty hunters, Krrsantan and Boba Fett. While Fett was to track down Luke Skywalker, the Rebel who destroyed the Death Star and who was secretly Vader's son, Krrsantan was hired to find and capture an agent of the Emperor. Vader wanted this agent, whose identity and purpose Darth Sidious did not reveal to the Dark Lord, in order to find out why he was working for the Emperor.[2]
            Krrsantan successfully tracked down Cylo and discovered that he was moving illegal alien parts to a secret base in the Outer Rim. The agent discovered Krrsantan was following him before he could find out where the base was or what he was doing for the Emperor. Krrsantan captured the agent and brought him to Vader aboard his Nubian starship, where he witnessed the agent, whose named was Cylo-IV, being killed by Vader's new torture droid, 0-0-0, but not before providing the information Krrsantan had previously failed to acquire.[6]
            Sometime after his contract for Vader expired, Krrsantan was summoned along with fellow bounty hunters Bossk, IG-90 and Beebox to a cantina on Son-tuul where, as he waited for his fellows, Krrsantan entered the cantina's fighting pits, where captured Wookiees fought each other for the entertainment of the customers. Krrsantan strangled a fighter and took his place to become a contestant, becoming one of the only Wookiees to enter the pits willingly. The Wookiee bounty hunter won the fight by beating his opponent to death.[7]
            After the fight, Krrsantan joined Beebox, Bossk and IG-90 in the cantina where they were approached by rogue archaeologist Aphra, who had issued the summons. She told the assembled bounty hunters about her plans for a heist: the Empire had just broken the criminal element known as the Son-tuul Pride, which dominated Son-tuul's underworld. The fortune they had hoarded was in transit to the Imperial vaults. Aphra told the bounty hunters that she had inside information which would allow them to locate the transport, circumvent the guards and get away, and that she was offering them a part in exchange for their services.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Krrsantan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascBlackKrrsantan</string></dict>
        <key>Hanharr</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.10.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hanharr was a male Wookiee who worked as a bounty hunter, operating primarily out of Nar Shaddaa, during and in the years after the Jedi Civil War. A ruthless hunter and brutal sociopath who was rumored to have murdered his own tribe in cold blood, he was regarded as one of the most deadly of his profession.
            Hanharr was raised on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk, living in the canopies with other Wookiees, but never truly feeling at home among them. Instead, he began to take an interest in the Shadowlands, the ground level of Kashyyyk, at an early age, sensing fascination at its perils and constant darkness. To live in the Shadowlands was considered dishonorable by the Wookiees, but the call proved too strong for Hanharr to resist, and he began to spend more and more time there, moving freely and killing at will. In time, his tribe refused to accept him back, for they sensed too much of a killer within him.
            When the humans of Czerka Corporation arrived on Kashyyyk, they didn't immediately seem to pose a threat to the Wookiee tribe. Yet when they had been accepted by Hanharr's tribe and infested it deep enough, they struck against the villagers. Hanharr watched it all from afar, seeing that the humans of Czerka were physically weak but still predators, and knowing that his tribe was about to become enslaved forever, hunted as prey and demeaned. And so, to save them from this cruel fate, Hanharr took it upon himself to slaughter his entire village, starting with the youngest. With ryyk blade and bowcaster, Hanharr worked his way from the weakest to the strongest of his people, ambushing them in their sleep. When others were awakened by the attacks, he killed them too—but for everyone that died, he grabbed them by the throat and stared into their eyes, showing them the full darkness of the Shadowlands and that their weakness was the reason they had to die. When the Czerka slavers discovered that their herd had been destroyed, they took Hanharr and shackled him, taking him into slavery and intending him to haul cargo on board starships. However, on the ship, there was nowhere for the humans to run when Hanharr set about killing all of them. Over the course of weeks, Hanharr stalked the slavers across the ship, letting them hide and starve slowly, waiting till the last possible moment before killing them, stuffing their bodies into storage compartments as a surprise for the other slavers to find. After all the slavers were killed, the ship—apparently on autopilot—eventually reached its destination: Nar Shaddaa.
            Nar Shaddaa was not the worst possible place for a Wookiee hunter to be stranded on. There, Hanharr could again climb to great heights, hunt for prey, and admire the newfound depths of the Shadowlands. Hanharr, having learned Czerka's lesson, decided to take that lesson back to humans, in retribution for his dead people in a twisted version of the Wookiee life debt. He became a slaver, selling entire families at a time, intending to bring about the misery and death of every single human in the galaxy.
            There was a bitter history between Hanharr and the human female bounty hunter Mira. Previously, Hanharr had been employed to hunt Mira, and had trapped her in a series of vents, where he planned to ambush her. However, she escaped from him when his own explosives (set to kill her) exploded as he ran after her. He painfully experienced that Mira had broadcast a signal to temporarily blind the mines' sensor receptors. He was almost killed but, taken by pity, Mira saved his life. It is unknown whether Mira knew she would then be owed a life debt, and it is certain that she wasn't keen on the idea, but Hanharr disliked it even more so. To be shown mercy by prey such as Mira was the worst insult imaginable to the Wookiee, and worse yet, he now owed his life to a human. To Hanharr, Mira had done to him just what Czerka had done to his people—she had broken him with slavery.
            He detested the idea of a life debt, because he thought that it made him weak and a slave, yet he held on to this tradition because it was the last thing to connect him to his dead people. He served his life debt to Mira, but believed that by killing her he could free himself; thus he would often swing between wanting to kill her and stalking her from the shadows. At one time, he grabbed her by the throat and promised to derive pleasure from killing her sometime in the future, when the time was right. Mira often told Hanharr that she didn't want his life debt but Hanharr's insanity meant that he could see no way out other than to kill Mira.
            Hanharr was hired by Vogga the Hutt to meet Goto and kill him. "Goto" always appeared as a hologram, and so no one knew that it was actually the spherical droid projecting it. Vogga warned him to finish the job or not come back to him at all. Working with one of Goto's men, Visquis, they planned to capture Meetra Surik and bring her to Goto for Hanharr to kill. However, Mira came in her place.
            Eventually, Hanharr and Mira dueled in Visquis's secret base, and there Mira defeated him. Shortly after, Kreia healed his most serious wounds, saving his life, cursing him with another life debt that Hanharr had no choice but to accept.

        <key>Freyyr</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.11.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Freyyr (pronounced /fɹeɹ/) was a Wookiee Chieftain, the father of Zaalbar and Chuundar, from the village of Rwookrrorro on Kashyyyk.
            After Freyyr's son Zaalbar was exiled from Kashyyyk for being a madclaw after attacking his other son Chuundar for dealing with slavers, the latter began to spread rumors about his father's increasing state of instability. This allowed Chuundar to eventually oust Freyyr from his position, exiling him to the Shadowlands by branding him, too, as a madclaw.
            Some time later when Zaalbar, accompanied by Revan and his companions arrived on Kashyyyk, Chuundar asked Revan to kill "a mad Wookiee" who lurked in the Shadowlands. Upon further investigation in the dangerous Lower Shadowlands, Revan learned the true story. Freyyr was indeed feral by the time they met him and, not recognizing the ex-Jedi Jolee Bindo who had helped him to escape slavery at the hands of the Czerka Corporation, attacked them both. In the ensuing melee Freyyr was subdued, but instead of killing him, Revan managed to reason with him enough to learn the truth of both his and Zaalbar's exile.
            After discussing the current matters, Revan agreed to help Freyyr by retrieving the blade part of Bacca's Ceremonial Blade, which was eventually found in the hide of a terentatek that had been lurking nearby. However, since Chuundar still possessed the hilt of the sword, he still held some measure of legitimacy among the Wookiees of Rwookrrorro. Bacca's Ceremonial Blade was a sacred relic to the Wookiees and the symbol of authority for all chieftains since Bacca himself. With the blade in their possession Freyyr, Revan and his companions ascended back to the village, after a brief confrontation with some of Chuundar's lackeys, and then led a revolt against Chuundar and his backers, the Czerka Corporation, killing Chuundar.
            Freyyr once again became chieftain of the village, and upon his son's request, gave Zaalbar the blade in gratitude and as a sign of repentance for exiling him years before.
            In the alternative dark side ending, Revan can kill him and help Chuundar. He can also pretend to be helping Freyyr by bringing him to Chuundar's court and then kill him with Chuundar, Zaalbar, Wookiees loyal to Chuundar, and Czerka guards.
            Freyyr's warblade can be found by the Jedi Exile in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Freyyr</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascFreyyr</string></dict>
        <key>Tarfful</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.12.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tarfful was a male Wookiee chieftain and general who helped defend his native planet Kashyyyk during the Clone Wars. During the war, he led a band of Wookiees to answer a distress signal made by Chewbacca, who was imprisoned on the Trandoshan hunting grounds of Wasskah. Tarfful later participated in the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside Chewbacca and Jedi Master Yoda.
            A male Wookiee native to his species's homeworld of Kashyyyk, Tarfful served as the chieftain of the coastal city Kachirho at the time of the Clone Wars.[3] He also held the rank of general among his people.[1]
            One standard year into the war, one of Tarfful's fellow Wookiees, Chewbacca, was captured by Trandoshans and taken to Wasskah to be hunted for sport. There, Chewbacca managed to build a device which sent a distress signal to Kashyyyk. Upon hearing of his friend's situation, Tarfful hired the bounty hunters Sugi and Seripas to transport him and a group of his most trusted warriors to Wasskah. Once there, the chieftain and his men made quick work of the Trandoshans and rescued Chewbacca, as well as Jedi younglings Ahsoka Tano, Jinx, and O-Mer.[4]
            Tarfful then took part in the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside Chewbacca and Jedi Generals Yoda, Luminara Unduli and Quinlan Vos.[5] Aided by the Grand Army of the Republic, he led a local militia against the invading Separatist droid forces. Following the implementation of Order 66, Tarfful and Chewbacca helped Yoda elude the clone troopers and escape from the planet.[2]
            Tarfful was a massive Wookiee who was covered with dark brown fur and wore armor around his shoulders and chest. He demonstrated great loyalty and trust amongst his warriors and allies, traits that were held in high honor in Wookiee culture.[6] He worked closely with Chewbacca during the Clone Wars, and was considered a dear friend by Jedi Master Yoda.[1]
            Tarfful was played by Michael Kingma in Revenge of the Sith. He originally appeared in the 2005 Star Wars Legends video game Star Wars: Republic Commando.
            According to the Revenge of the Sith DVD text commentary, during Yoda's "goodbye" scene to Chewbacca and Tarfful in the film, Tarfful's roar is actually Itchy's roar from The Star Wars Holiday Special.
            In the 2014 mobile game Star Wars: Galactic Defense, Tarfful can be seen yelling "hnn-rowr yrroonn nng rarr," a quote which first appeared in the Legends comic Empire's End and meant "long live the New Republic," when translated from Shyriiwook.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tarfful</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascTarfful</string></dict>

Tolruck used the assassin probe to fire two toxo-darts into Blackstripe's chest. When the poison failed to slow down the Wookiee who continue climbing a wroshyr tree, Tolruck used his control visor to remotely launch the assassin probe into Blackstripe and explode.

After years of toil, Sagwa was freed by Chewbacca and participated in a break-out, escaping alongside Tak and other slaves.
            Sagwa was a Wookiee from the inland tree city of Rwookrrorro on the planet Kashyyyk. During the Imperial Era he attempted to defend his fellow Wookiees from Imperial patrols, but was imprisoned and forced to work in the spice mines of Kessel as a slave. He wore an electro-charged slaving collar and had his shaggy arms bound by heavy shackles. Years of toil took their toll on his body, leaving his brown fur balding due to illness, though he continued to selflessly spare weaker slaves from the most brutal mining duties.[1]
            Sagwa was among the slaves who participated in the uprising instigated by L3-37, and was freed by Chewbacca after the Wookiee attacked Sagwa's guards. The two Wookiees fought alongside each other, and Sagwa helped Chewbacca and Han Solo escape the mines with a stash of unrefined coaxium. Once outside, Sagwa fought off Pyke sentinels and helped Chewbacca load the coaxium into smuggling compartments aboard the Millennium Falcon. He bid farewell to Chewbacca before following Tak and other escaped prisoners.[2]
            Sagwa was a selfless individual, attempting to defend his fellow Wookiees from Imperial patrols on Kashyyyk, and later sparing weaker slaves from brutal toil in the spice mines of Kessel.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sagwa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascSagwa</string></dict>

            During his sentence, he befriended fellow prisoners Lyshaa and Sagoro Autem. When the Grand Army of the Republic attacked the base, the three found the perfect opportunity to escape. However, they came face-to-face with Jedi Masters Quinlan Vos and Shaak Ti, whose Padawan, Fe Sun, was killed by Lyshaa. Luckily, the Republic sided with them.

            In 29 BBY, Rashtah accompanied Krayn to Rorak 5 for a business meeting with the Colicoids, who sought total control over the spice operations on Nar Shaddaa. Krayn directed Rashtah to monitor the movements of the slave trader "Bakleeda," an advisor to the Colicoids who was tasked with inspecting the crime-lord's factories on the "Smuggler's Moon."
            After an intense struggle, Rashtah was killed in a turbolift within the slave factories of Nar Shaddaa by "Bakleeda" (Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in disguise), whom the Wookiee had attacked at the behest of Krayn.
            Rashtah had a scar that ran from his head to his lip; a battle-damaged eye was covered by an eyepatch.
            Although Jedi Quest: Path to Truth depicts Rashtah with a scar running through his eye and wearing an eye patch, in the Jedi Quest comic series he is depicted with both eyes intact.

        <key>Lumpawaroo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.18.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lumpawaroo, also known as Waroo, was a Wookiee male who emerged from the shadow of his famous father Chewbacca to become a brave, talented, and powerful warrior within the Rwookrrorro community on the planet Kashyyyk. Born Lumpawarrump in 1 BBY and known as Lumpy throughout his youth, he was raised by his mother Mallatobuck and his grandfather Attichitcuk while Chewbacca served a life debt to and traveled the galaxy with the Human smuggler Han Solo. Lumpawarrump idolized his father and constantly dreamed of the elder Wookiee's adventures while Chewbacca was away. While gathering wasaka berries in Kashyyyk's dangerous Shadowlands in preparation for Chewbacca's 200th birthday, a young Lumpawarrump hoped to be as brave as his father but ended up hiding, terrified, from the various creatures that lurked in the forest. Although his father rescued him and brought him home, the ordeal caused Lumpawarrump considerable trauma. Coupled with the absence of a father figure to help him grow into a brave young man, the experience turned Lumpawarrump into a shy and timid Wookiee who rarely left his home. Unless Chewbacca was around for Lumpawarrump to attempt to impress, he stayed away from danger and did not find his rrakktorr, the eager and defiant strength of a male Wookiee's heart.
            In 1 ABY, two years after Lumpawarrump's misadventure in the Shadowlands, he and his family were visited by members of the Galactic Empire on the Wookiee holiday Life Day. The Imperials were searching Kashyyyk for ties between its inhabitants and the Rebel Alliance and remained in Lumpawarrump's home for some time before Chewbacca and Solo arrived to celebrate the holiday. Chewbacca and Solo helped free Lumpawarrump and many other Wookiees from slavery at the hands of the Nagai Knife three years later, and in 8 ABY, Lumpawarrump and Mallatobuck visited Chewbacca at his apartment on the galactic capital of Coruscant. The three became tangled in an Imperial scheme to destroy the New Republic that Chewbacca and Solo served, and Lumpawarrump was kidnapped by several Coruscanti underdwellers and taken to a secret Imperial detention center in the planet's underlevels. After his parents rescued him, the three Wookiees were able to prevent the underdwellers from unleashing a nerve toxin at an upcoming New Republic governmental banquet.
            In 16 ABY, Lumpawarrump's coming-of-age hrrtayyk ceremony was interrupted when Chewbacca, who was guiding his son through it, learned that Solo had been kidnapped by the Yevethan Duskhan League. Lumpawarrump tagged along on the rescue mission so that he might prove himself, and father and son stormed the Yevethan Star Destroyer Pride of Yevetha and rescued the captive Solo. Lumpawarrump found his rrakktorr, passed his hrrtayyk, and earned his new name, Lumpawaroo, after receiving a blaster wound in the leg and meeting it without flinching. Chewbacca was able to spend more time with Lumpawaroo over the next several years, but when the elder Wookiee was killed in 25 ABY, Lumpawaroo and his cousin Lowbacca pledged to take over Chewbacca's life debt to Solo. Solo delayed them for four years in order to grieve the loss of his best friend, but in 29 ABY, they reaffirmed their convictions and attached themselves to Solo, although they ultimately served him for less than six years. In 40 ABY, Solo and his wife Leia Organa Solo came to Kashyyyk to speak with the planet's Rock Council, and Lumpawaroo guided them across Wroshyr trees for four days as they made their way to Council Rock. Lumpawaroo later crewed the Solos' starship Millennium Falcon and worked to extinguish forest fires that raged across Kashyyyk after an orbital bombardment by the Galactic Alliance Fifth Fleet.
            The Wookiee male Lumpawarrump was born[3] in 1 BBY[2] in the Kashyyyk city of Rwookrrorro to Mallatobuck, a teacher and caregiver who worked in a nearby village's nursery ring. Mallatobuck had recently wed Chewbacca, a mechanic and co-pilot to the Human smuggler Han Solo, and the newlyweds had conceived Lumpawarrump during their honeymoon. Chewbacca had then left the planet with Solo, to whom he had sworn a Wookiee life debt of protection, and Lumpawarrump was born nearly one year later. Chewbacca and Solo returned to Kashyyyk shortly thereafter while on a supply run to the Corporate Sector, and both were overjoyed to discover Mallatobuck holding the newborn Lumpawarrump in her Rwookrrorro home.[3] Chewbacca roared with pride as he realized that he had become a father,[10] and the new parents immediately began to discuss baby names.[3] They ultimately settled on Lumpawarrump, or "Lumpy" for short.[11]
            Chewbacca was unable to remain with his new son for long and quickly left with Solo for the Corporate Sector,[3] but he returned to Kashyyyk as often as he could over the subsequent years to visit his family,[10][12] including a several-week-long visit in 0 BBY.[13] Lumpawarrump, Mallatobuck, and Chewbacca's father Attichitcuk were designated as a Wookiee honor family and were looked after by Chewbacca's close friends on Kashyyyk. While Chewbacca and Solo roamed the galaxy, Lumpawarrump was raised on Kashyyyk by his mother and grandfather.[12] Attichitcuk lived with Lumpawarrump and Mallatobuck in their treetop dwelling[14] and was content to live out his elder years playing with his young grandson.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lumpawaroo/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascLumpawaroo</string></dict>
        <key>Lowbacca</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.19.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lowbacca (meaning "dutiful friend" in Shyriiwook[3]) or "Lowie" was a Wookiee Jedi Knight during the Yuuzhan Vong War. He was the nephew of Chewbacca, the son of Kallabow and Mahraccor, and the brother of Sirrakuk. He studied at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum and was a companion of Jaina Solo, Jacen Solo and Tenel Ka. He wielded a bronze-bladed lightsaber.
            Lowbacca the Wookiee was born to Kallabow and Mahraccor, with his mother Kallabow being the sister of the famous Rebel hero Chewbacca. While growing up, he had had two passions: computer science and the study of Kashyyyk's complex plant life. The latter had prompted him to go alone into the dangerous lower levels of his homeworld's forests during his rite of passage to young adulthood, and to pit himself against the deadly syren plant.
            Being a Wookiee, Lowbacca was a rarity among Jedi, as Force-sensitives were even less common among Wookiees than among other species, one being born only every century or so.
            In 23 ABY at the age of 19, he went to study at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum. Since most of the people Lowbacca would have to interact with were not fluent in Shyriiwook, the Wookiee trade language, he used a small translator droid that he carried at his waist named Em Teedee. Later in 24 ABY it was modified to hover, and followed him around flying. He became friends with Jaina Solo, Jacen Solo and Tenel Ka. Jacen had a good sense of humour, and Lowie liked him because of this. Lowbacca's combination of computer skills and biological knowledge, and desire to take on the impossible would make him an invaluable asset to the Jedi.
            Lowbacca unknowingly set a chain of events in motion when he discovered what eventually turned out to be a derelict TIE Fighter in the jungles of Yavin 4. His new friend Jaina Solo, somewhat envious of Lowbacca's T-23 skyhopper, wanted to repair the TIE Fighter. With the help of Lowbacca, Jacen Solo, and Tenel Ka, she did, but the friends didn't know that they were being watched by the TIE Fighter's pilot, Qorl. Eventually he was forced to reveal himself and he took the Solo twins hostage, forcing them to repair the fighter for him.
            Lowbacca ran away to his skyhopper, and returned with it in an attempt to intimidate Qorl into running away. However, Qorl called his bluff and critically damaged the airspeeder, forcing Lowbacca to abandon it in the jungle. Lowbacca tore through the jungle on foot for the Praxeum, losing Em Teedee in the process. Once he got there, he couldn't communicate with anyone. He then remembered that his uncle and Han Solo were still in the system and within communicator range, delivering supplies to Lando Calrissian's GemDiver Station. Solo translated the situation to Tionne Solusar. A rescue mission was mounted and the twins were recovered.
            Shortly thereafter, Lowbacca was kidnapped along with his friends Jacen and Jaina, as well as Em Teedee while on a field trip to GemDiver Station. The little droid was taken away from him and they were brought to the Shadow Academy. There, Nightsister Tamith Kai tried to exploit his anger in an attempt to turn him to the dark side. She went to such lengths as reprogramming Em Teedee to spout pro-Imperial propaganda or subjecting him to arduous torture.
            Lowbacca gave into his anger twice, the first time when Brakiss attacked Jaina with Force lightning, and the other when he smashed a screeching sonic generator beyond all repair. However, Lowbacca was able to keep himself from being indoctrinated. When Jacen freed himself using a Corusca gem that he had acquired during their field trip, Lowbacca used his excellent programming skills to help his friends in an escape attempt aboard the station just in time for Luke and Tenel Ka to show up to rescue them.
            Later, Lowbacca went to Kashyyyk with Jacen, Jaina, and Tenel Ka in response to his sister, Sirrakuk's, coming of age and going deep in the underlevels of Kashyyyk to harvest strands of the deadly syren plant. Lowbacca had done this under unwise counsel alone, and Sirrakuk wished to repeat this, as did her best friend and Lowbacca's admirer, Raabakyysh. When Raaba did, though, she disappeared and was presumed dead.
            Shortly after their arrival, the Second Imperium, headed by Zekk, came to raid a factory for computer supplies for the new fleet. The two parties soon met, and started a skirmish that killed the Nightsister Garowyn, tumbling into the underlevels of the Kashyyyk forest. There, Lowbacca and the others headed off Vonnda Ra and eleven stormtroopers. Shortly following, they encountered a syren plant. There, Nightsister Vonnda Ra and Sirrakuk were swallowed by the carnivorous plant, with Vonnda Ra being eaten and Sirrakuk pulling out the strands of the plant and then being pulled out by Lowbacca.
            In the Third Battle of Yavin, Tenel Ka and Lowie sabotaged the floating battle platform from which Tamith Kai lead her forces, causing it to crash into a river killing the Nightsister. Suddenly, a bomb exploded and destroyed a large proportion of the Jedi Praxeum though no one was badly injured. With the end of the battle, the Second Imperium had been defeated.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lowbacca</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascLowbacca</string></dict>

        <key>Dalborra</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.22.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dalborra was a male Wookiee who lived during the time of the Great Galactic War. He served in the reconstituted Sith Empire's Army.
            During the final stages of the Great War, Dalborra was stationed on the planet Dantooine. As the war came to a close and the Sith sacked Coruscant, Dalborra came up behind two Republic Military personnel and knocked their heads together with his bare hands, an example of his strength. A large blaster rifle with numerous scopes caught his eye and he took it.
            While operating, Dalborra was tracked down by a bounty hunter named Braden, who sought to collect one of the numerous bounties on Dalborra despite the ceasefire between the Republic and the Sith Empire. When Braden refused orders to call off his hunt, his client fired on him with concussion missiles. Braden was knocked off his feet, he survived, but Dalborra found him, all the while holding his new weapon.
            Dalborra then escorted and placed Braden on a Sith warship that was transferring Human prisoners to Korriban. While passing through the Kuat sector of the Core Worlds, the warship they were traveling on attacked a Republic transport ship.
            After the following battle Jedi Master Dar'Nala was taken captive and placed on the same ship for torture. After failing to cooperate with the Sith she helped Dalborra's prisoner Braden escape. Due to this and her failure to cooperate, the Sith gave Dalborra the okay to execute her, which he ostensibly did by electrocution. However, Dalborra was really under Dar'Nala's influence, so he faked her death.
            Later when the Imperial Transport landed on Korriban, Dalborra was denied access to the planet due to the loss of his prisoner but was still promised his payment. Soon after he was nearly killed in the bombing and destruction of the Transport he had arrived on. Later, he resumed his mission of tracking Braden and followed him to Coruscant. Braden attempted to tell the authorities of the identity of the Sith Lord who ordered the attack on the Envoy.
            However, he only succeeded in killing the Republic officer who had betrayed him—Lesl—and the Kel Dor Jedi Master Zym. As his quarry departed in his starship, the nearby Galactic Senate was damaged by a bomb attack. Dalborra observed both Braden's departure and the bombing of the Senate.
            Afterwards, Dalborra was brought to the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine under the influence of the Force by recently found alive Jedi Master Dar'Nala, where Dalborra was quickly accused a traitor by Lieutenant Harron Tavus, who held him at gunpoint. Master Dar'nala was able to calm the group, telling Tavus that Dalborra's mind was being "redirected". The group then argued about neutralizing the effect of the treaty, while blaming it on Darth Baras.
            Dalborra later accompanied Master Dar'Nala and Lieutenant Tavus to an ancient crystal cave, also on Dantooine, to meet Lord Baras. The group soon engaged in a brutal fight, where Dalborra attacked two Imperial troopers. Jedi Knight Satele Shan then arrived unexpectedly and was asked by Dar'Nala to aid them in the battle. He later struck and killed Dar'Nala during the battle and fled further into the caves.
            As Dalborra fled, Braden managed to locate him and finally captured him.
            Dalborra was part of the Sith Empire, presumably working as a mercenary. He is the only known Wookiee to have allied himself with the Sith. He wore a helmet and goggles similar to those of a podracer. His weapons of choice seemed to be his bare hands, a long staff similar to a force pike, and a heavy rifle. He wore a long body holster similar to what Chewbacca would wear thousands of years later, and a sort of backpack with a sensor-like rod protruding from it.

During the war, Gungi and a group of five other younglings, (Petro, Katooni, Byph, Ganodi and Zatt) were deemed to be at the top of their class and, led by Ahsoka Tano, they traveled to Ilum to participate in the Gathering; an ancient Jedi ritual that proved a youngling's readiness to become a Padawan.
            Gungi, who was amongst the top of his class was sent to Ilum with his fellow Jedi younglings. While on Ilum, the younglings were instructed by Jedi Master Yoda to enter a Crystal Cave and find their kyber crystals, which were necessary for the younglings to construct their first lightsabers. Every crystal in the cave was specific to each individual, and Gungi found his crystal on an island across a body of water within the cave Ignoring Ganodi, who told him to move on, he had to meditate to wait for the body of water to freeze so he could cross, and he was later commended by Master Yoda on his patience.[1]
            While on their way back to Coruscant aboard the Crucible, Gungi and his fellow younglings began creating their lightsabers under the guidance of Professor Huyang when the Jedi's ship was attacked by the pirate Hondo Ohnaka. Hondo and his pirate crew were looking for the kyber crystals the younglings had just collected as they were worth lots of credits on the black market. Though the younglings managed to escape the pirates, Ahsoka Tano was pulled into space along with the pirates because the Crucible had managed to get away from the pirates docking station and had created a vacuum.[3]
            Gungi and his youngling friends were building their lightsabers as they had free time, due to the fact their ship was stranded. After Gungi, Petro and Byph finished their lightsabers the group decided to go to Florrum to cool their engines (which were at risk of exploding) and to save Ahsoka. Once there, they joined the troupe of the Dug Preigo to infiltrate the base of Hondo before stealing back Ahsoka's lightsabers, freeing Ahsoka and escaping on a stolen speeder.[4]
            After escaping on the stolen speeder Petro made contact with R2-D2 and Ganodi on board the Crucible, but by the time the Crucible got to them the speeder was almost at a ravine leading the Jedi to have to get onboard fast. Gungi and Byph ended up hanging of the edge of the ramp before the pirates shot a missile at the ship causing it to crash and the pirates to take them hostage yet again. When they reached Hondo's base they found it was under attack by General Grievous and with the common goal to escape the Separatists, the Jedi and the pirates worked together freeing Ohnaka and escaped to his secret private fleet, before managing to leave Florrum.[5]
            Gungi was later seen training outside the Jedi Temple some time after the bombing of the Temple's hangar. Along with his teacher, Tera Sinube, Gungi observed as Anakin Skywalker and Barriss Offee dueled outside until Offee was apprehended.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gungi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascGungi</string></dict>
        <key>Greybok</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.24.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Greybok was a Wookiee male tribal diplomat who was enslaved and forced to mine spice on the planet Sevarcos in a mine controlled by the Galactic Empire. He and his fellow slaves the Weequay Hatchet and the Quarren Palabar freed themselves during the Battle of Sevarcos. Later, Greybok and his friends took part in the liberation of the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk.
            Prior to the Age of the Empire, Greybok was a tribal diplomat. When the Empire enslaved the Wookiee species, he was enslaved and shipped off to the spice mines of Sevarcos. As a slave, his job was to swing a pneumo-hammer and pulverize rock. After trying to escape the mines on one occasion, the slavers chopped off one of his arms as punishment. Sometime after the Battle of Endor, the Imperial mines on Sevarcos were attacked by the New Republic and Greybok watched the battle unfold alongside the Weequay slave Hatchet and the Quarren slave Palabar. Hatchet suggested the trio use the opportunity to escape, but Greybok, with the support of Palabar, demanded they aid the Republic and fight both the slavers and the Imperials. [1]
            Ignoring Hatchet's protests, Greybok charged into the fight and flung one Imperial into a crevasse, heading for the corral in which three rancors were kept by the slavers. Once at the gate, the Wookiee beat off the lock with a rock while under Imperial fire, allowing the rancors free to attack the Empire's forces. As the first rancor exited the coral, it knocked the gate into its Wookiee liberator, flinging Greybok into a rock. Dazed, the slave was unable to defend himself when a Zygerrian slaver approached and shot him with a needler, intending to kill him with the weapon.[1]
            However, before the pain caused by the needler stopped Greybok's heart, Hatchet bludgeoned the slaver to death with a rock. Seeing he was saved, the Wookiee passed out, only awaking once the battle was over and the Imperials and slavers defeated. Unsure of what to do next, Hatchet asked a nearby New Republic soldier, who informed the trio they were free, but beyond that was not sure what would happened to them. After the soldier had moved on, Hatchet suggested that they make the most of the freedom and take a walk.[1]
            In 5 ABY,[2] Greybok, Hatchet, and Palabar joined Han Solo and Chewbacca's mission to free Kashyyyk from Imperial rule. The Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari recruited them and a ragtag crew of Wookiee refugees. Together, the team traveled to Kashyyyk on her gunship Halo. At the behest of Palabar, the rebels used pneumo-hammers to hammer eyebolts into the wroshyr trees so that the Solo's team could take up position and fire on Camp Sardo's deflector shield generator.[3]
            When Hatchet claimed that he did not want to be there, Greybok silenced him by shaking him with his one remaining arm. After the former Imperial loyalty officer, Sinjir Rath Velus disabled the inhibitor chips controlling the Wookiee population on Kashyyyk, Greybok and his fellow crew served as gunners aboard Jas's gunship Halo. They blasted Imperial Forest troopers, LAIT gunships, and AT-ST walkers. Following a fierce battle, Kashyyyk was liberated by the combined efforts of the Wookiees and the New Republic.[3]
            In the months after the liberation of Kashyyyk, Greybok accompanied Chewbacca, other Wookiees, and New Republic soldiers on mopping up operations against Imperial holdouts. On one such operation, Greybok and his team shot several Imperial soldiers that had cornered a Wookiee child slave named Lumpawaroo, who was Chewbacca's son. After Commandant Dessard was taken prisoner, Chewbacca and Waroo reunited.[4]
            Greybok was a tall Wookiee. Prior to the Age of the Empire, he was a tribal diplomat. He lost an arm while he was working as a slave in the spice mines of Sevarcos. Due to his work as a slave, he knew how to wield a pneumo-hammer and pulverize rock. Despite losing one of his arms, Greybok was still strong enough to fling an Imperial in mechanized battle armor down a crevasse.[1] Following his emancipation, Greybook and other Wookiee refugees participated in the liberation of Kashyyyk.[3]
            Greybok first appeared in the novel Aftermath, which was written by Chuck Wendig and published in 2015.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Greybok</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascGreybok</string></dict>

        <key>Weebacca</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.26.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Weebacca was a male Wookiee spacer who tended to get into trouble and who had a habit of gambling and smuggling. He was a childhood friend of fellow Wookiee Chewbacca. When his homeworld of Kashyyyk was invaded and enslaved by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War, the Wookiee dropped his then-current dealings and rushed to fight for the planet's defense. Nevertheless, he turned into a double agent for the Empire prior to the battle to free the planet several years later. However, Chewbacca and the ex-smuggler Han Solo, both members of the New Republic, caught Weebacca trying to escape the destruction of Imperial Moff Hindane Darcc's palace along with the commanders of the Imperial forces on Kashyyyk, Moff Darcc himself, and the Trandoshan slaver Pekt. With his treachery revealed, Weebacca was killed by Chewbacca.
            Weebacca was a male Wookiee spacer and a longtime childhood friend of fellow Wookiee and Kashyyyk native Chewbacca. Weebacca was always in need of credits and had a love for the game of sabacc; it was not long before he got into smuggling and gambling. He dropped contact with his family and Chewbacca for a long time, but he eventually resurfaced as a runner of spice through the Kashyyyk system under the nose of Imperial patrols. He hated the Empire, and when his homeworld of Kashyyyk was invaded and enslaved during the Galactic Civil War, he dropped his lucrative smuggling career and rushed home to help his people. Nevertheless, Weebacca eventually became an agent for the Empire.[1]
            During the liberation of Kashyyyk from Trandoshan slavers and the Empire in 4 ABY,[2] Weebacca was destroying a Trandoshan building near the city of Kepitenochan when he was spotted by the New Republic agents Chewbacca and Han Solo. Despite the fact that they appeared to be fighting on the same side, seeing a lone Wookiee unharmed caught Solo's attention due to the carnage that had taken place against the Wookiees. Weebacca helped Chewbacca and Solo reoccupy Kepitenochan and rebuild the Government Tree, with which the two New Republic agents hoped to contact the New Republic. However, the Imperials had installed three jammers that prevented the agents from dispatching a message.[1]
            Weebacca claimed that the jammers were to be found in the city of Okikuti but did not go with Solo and Chewbacca to destroy them. When the New Republic agents and a company of Wookiees investigated the city—where they found no jammers—they were ambushed by Imperials, but Solo and the Wookiees were able to escape. Later, after the Wookiees destroyed Imperial Moff Hindane Darcc's palace, Weebacca tried to escape the planet with Darcc and the Trandoshan slaver Pekt—the leaders of the Imperial invasion forces—in an Imperial shuttle. However, Chewbacca and Solo spotted the Wookiee with the Imperials, and, with Weebacca's betrayal revealed, Chewbacca killed Weebacca in a duel while Darcc and Pekt fled.[1]
            Weebacca frequently got into trouble, and he was known for his habit of gambling—he particularly loved the game of sabacc. The Wookiee was a friend of Chewbacca during his childhood years, and the two were never cross with each other,[1] though Weebacca could be untrustworthy and petty at times. When in desperate need of large sums of credits, Weebacca was willing to take any job available, including posts as a bodyguard-for-hire.[3] He eventually betrayed the Wookiees by becoming a double agent for the Empire during his home planet's enslavement. He garnered a deep hatred for the Empire early in his life; nevertheless, he eventually joined the Empire prior to the liberation of Kashyyyk. Weebacca also had brown fur and was considered in his clan to be a "small Wookiee with a big Wookiee's attitude."[1] His name contained that of the ancient Wookiee hero Bacca, the first of the great chieftains of Kashyyyk. In Shyriiwook, the name "Bacca" meant "friendly."[4] Weebacca sported a pair of ryyk blades as his main weapons during the battle of Kashyyyk.[1]
            Weebacca made his only appearance in the 2001 video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its expansion pack. He was first mentioned in the game's strategy guide. In-game, he is a "hero" for the Wookiee faction, and as such, he is a special unit that cannot be manufactured or produced. During several missions in the game, the player must keep Weebacca alive in order to complete the level.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Weebacca</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascWeebacca</string></dict>
        <key>Warrchallra</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.27.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Warrchallra was a Wookiee male wroshyr wood sculptor from the city of Kachirho on the planet Kashyyyk, who fought in the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the occupation of Kashyyyk by the Galactic Empire following the war, Warrchallra lived in exile and became a freedom fighter as part of the Wookiee underground. Prior to the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Warrchallra provided the concept for the propaganda poster "Liberty for All" to the Clawdite illustrator Tavris Bahzel while the shapeshifter was disguised as a Twi'lek, who toned down the graphic violence it depicted.[1] By the year 34 ABY,[2] Warrchallra was focused on creating art that celebrated the Wookiee people.[1]
            Warrchallra was first mentioned in the reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released on October 25, 2016.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Warrchallra</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascWarrchallra</string></dict>
        <key>Bowdaar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.28.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bowdaar was a male Wookiee slave forced by his masters into becoming a gladiatorial fighter in arenas spanning the galaxy. His prowess as a warrior and undefeated record earned him the names "The Killer from Kashyyyk," "Deathmountain," and "Boneshatterer."
            Captured as a child from his homeworld of Kashyyyk, Bowdaar was forced into a life of violence, fighting for survival in gladiator arenas from one side of the galaxy to the other. He proved himself to be a very capable fighter. Over more than a century, Bowdaar fought in single combat in more than ten thousand matches against such formidable opponents as rancors, Mandalorians, gundarks and even a Jedi. In all that time he never lost a match.[1]
            Almost more impressive was the fact that Bowdaar often fought without a single weapon or piece of armor. Amongst the more ignorant and gullible denizens of the criminal underworld, rumors spread that he was some form of immortal being. Those who faced Bowdaar in combat and lived to tell about it said he was simply the best fighter around.[1]
            By 3643 BBY, Bowdaar ended up a pet gladiator to Drooga the Hutt to pay off a gambler's debt. He kept Bowdaar in a cage between matches and used him cruelly and pettily. Drooga was annoyed that Bowdaar slew all his opponents too quickly, depriving him of the full entertainment value of the fights. He took many steps to keep Bowdaar at a disadvantage, such as depriving him of any weapons and draining half his blood to keep him weak, and even poisoning him outright.
            It was at this time when a smuggler captain arrived on Nar Shaddaa to barter a male shanjaru for a prototype engine. Upon locating Drooga's barge in the Nikto Sector, Bowdaar was to fight a gang of Kaleesh warriors. Though the Wookiee could've taken them by himself, the smuggler chose to intervene. Bowdaar later assisted the smuggler against Zank Helrott, Rogun the Butcher's bounty hunter.
            Finally, Drooga decided to do away with the Wookiee in one last magnificent fight to the death with his pet gundark, which he had kept starving for the occasion. The smuggler captain assisted Bowdaar in his fight with the gundark, with simultaneously infuriated Drooga while also providing him with suitable entertainment for the evening. Once the gundark was dead, Drooga decided that the Wookiee was no longer worth the costs to maintain him and simply turned him loose, who then joined the smuggler's crew.
            Bowdaar was a loner and having grown up as a slave owned by one master or another for decades, considered himself to have no home, family or friends. His success in the fighting pits earned his various masters untold wealth, but he never shared in the spoils of his victories. What he did own was the heart and strength of a warrior and an unparalleled will to survive.[1]
            Bowdaar was first mentioned in a The Holonet entry on the official Star Wars: The Old Republic website. His entry has several phrases written in Aurebesh which read "Good luck redhead," "Karssk's Prey" and "Great Feastmaster's collateral."[1]
            Bowdaar becomes the second companion for the Smuggler character in Star Wars: The Old Republic, following the completion of the storyline on Nar Shaddaa.
            Bowdaar appears again in Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire's Chapter XIII as an Alliance quest when the player has to participate in the Zakuulan arena in order to recruit him as a companion.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bowdaar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsWookieMascBowdaar</string></dict>
