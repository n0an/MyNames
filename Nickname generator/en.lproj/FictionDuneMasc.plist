They receive a message from Othwi Yake, Assistant to the Ixian Ambassador, that Face Dancers have infiltrated the Ixian Embassy, and are planning to assassinate Leto II. They try to warn Leto, but the message does not reach his convoy in time; however, the plot fails, as Anteac and Luyseyal knew it would. They achieve little in their meeting with Leto II, and he takes the priceless vial of spice-essence with which they hoped to test his mortality. He reminds Luyseyal of the lesson learned from past over-machined societies: "The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines." Later, Leto enlists Anteac's aid in detecting the Face Dancers, who by that time have replaced everyone in the Ixian Embassy except the new Ambassador, Hwi Noree. In particular, Anteac identifies the duplicate of Yake, who has been killed and replicated since the original sent his warning to Anteac. Leto's chief minister Moneo Atreides suggests to the God Emperor that Anteac is a secret Mentat, a skill prohibited in the Empire by Leto himself; Leto agrees but says that it amuses him. Hwi shares her knowledge of the environment in which she was brought up with Anteac, who has been conscripted by Leto to lead a Fish Speaker assault on Ix, to wrest the secret of Hwi's origins. Anteac is shocked at the knowledge that Hwi is to marry Leto, and at the same time annoyed that her order had allowed so talented a woman as Hwi to pass through their training program without turning her into one of them. With Anteac's faithful assistance, Leto's forces successfully invade Ix and capture Malky, but Anteac is killed.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string></string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneMascAnteac</string></dict>

            Secretly, however, Bijaz was a Tleilaxu Master with a hidden purpose: to control the first ghola of Duncan Idaho, Hayt. Bijaz implanted the command to kill Muad'dib when the Emperor was in the depths of grief—this was accomplished using the secret whistling language of the Bene Tleilax.
            When Idaho confronted Paul after the death of Chani, the trauma restored his pre-ghola memories and he spares Paul. While the plan failed, it is revealed that it was only a contingency; the Tleilaxu were planning to use Idaho as proof of gholas regaining memories, and they were planning to use Chani's ghola as a bargaining chip. However, Paul refuses and Idaho instead kills Bijaz to prevent any more temptation. The Tleilaxu's fate following this incident was unknown. However, it was possible his body was returned to Tleilax and restored to life via Tlelaxu technology, such as occurred with Scytale.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Bijaz</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneMascBijaz</string></dict>
        <key>Duncan Idaho</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.01.0.3</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Duncan Idaho is a fictional character in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Introduced in the first novel of the series, 1965's Dune, the character became a breakout character as the readers liked him and was revived by Herbert in 1969's Dune Messiah.[3] He is the only character to feature in all six of Herbert's original Dune novels.
            At the time of Frank Herbert's original novel Dune (1965), Idaho is a Swordmaster of the Ginaz in the service of House Atreides and one of Duke Leto's right-hand men (with Gurney Halleck and Thufir Hawat). When the Atreides take over the planet Arrakis at the order of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, Idaho becomes Leto's ambassador to the Fremen, the desert people of Dune that Leto hopes will ally with him in the coming war against the Emperor and the Harkonnens. Idaho goes to live with the Fremen, serving both Leto and Fremen leader Stilgar. When the Emperor's dreaded Sardaukar attack Arrakis in the guise of Harkonnen troops, Idaho initially survives the assault and saves Leto's son Paul Atreides and concubine Lady Jessica. When they are cornered at a Botanical Testing Station, Paul and Jessica flee while Idaho holds off the enemy, but he is ultimately killed.[4] It is noted in Dune Messiah (1969) that a "grievous head wound" had caused Idaho's death,[8] and made clear in Children of Dune (1976) that Idaho had killed an unheard-of tally of nineteen Sardaukar before dying.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Idaho</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneMascDuncanIdaho</string></dict>

And his movements — he moved a hand or turned his head one way, then he spoke another way. It was difficult to follow." In her work In My Father's House (referenced via an epigraph in Dune), Shaddam's daughter Princess Irulan later writes of Fenring: "My father had only one real friend, I think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring ... one of the deadliest fighters in the Imperium." She goes on to describe him as "a dapper and ugly little man."</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasimir_Fenring</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneMascHasimirFenring</string></dict>

This region, though mysterious in nature, was known to be unattainable to females. Specifically, the spice melange allowed the Bene Gesserit to unlock genetic memory, but only on the female side. For reasons unknown, they could not see into the male side, and the very thought of trying was terrifying to them. Further, melange also exposed the Sisterhood (and others) to a very limited form of prescience - thoughts, feelings, images into the very near future, but no more.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Kwisatz_Haderach</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneMascKwisatz</string></dict>

            Teg is a military genius, having a very strong sense of honor, loyalty, and many of the characteristics of House Atreides, his ancestors. He is well known for doing the unexpected.

Paul is a prominent character in the first two novels in the series, Dune (1965) and Dune Messiah (1969), and returns in Children of Dune (1976). The character is brought back as two different gholas in the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson novels which conclude the original series, Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), and appears in the prequels Paul of Dune (2008) and The Winds of Dune (2009).
            A primary theme of Dune and its sequels is Frank Herbert's warning about society's tendencies to "give over every decision-making capacity" to a charismatic leader.[1] He said in 1979, "The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes."[2] Paul rises to leadership through military strategy and political maneuvering, but his superhuman powers and ability to fit himself into pre-existing religious infrastructure allow him to force himself upon mankind as their messiah. As "Muad'Dib," Paul becomes the central figure of a new religion, and reluctantly unleashes a bloody jihad in his name across the universe; Paul struggles with the potential idea of seizing divine control over his newly minted empire, only to finally escape from the burden of his destiny by placing it on his sister Alia and his offspring Leto II and Ghanima.
            Paul was portrayed by Kyle MacLachlan in David Lynch's 1984 film adaptation, and by Alec Newman in the 2000 Dune miniseries and its 2003 sequel.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Atreides</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneMascMuad'Dib</string></dict>

            In the service of the ruthless Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, De Vries is a Mentat — a human specially trained to perform mental functions rivaling computers, which are forbidden universe-wide. In addition, De Vries has been "twisted" into an amoral sadist by his Tleilaxu creators.[1]
            De Vries is so loyal to Harkonnen that he continues to serve the Baron with great enthusiasm even though his Mentat abilities and great intelligence confirm his suspicions that his master plans to eventually kill him.[1] As he says in Dune:
            But you see, Baron, I know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as I am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I'm yet of much use.[1]
            De Vries is described in the novel Dune (though not portrayed on screen) as being addicted to the drug melange, which has colored both the sclera and irises of his eyes a characteristic deep blue.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piter_De_Vries</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionDuneMascPiterDeVries</string></dict>
