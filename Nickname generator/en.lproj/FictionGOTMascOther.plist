        <key>Aggo </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.1.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aggo is a Dothraki warrior sworn to Khaleesi Daenerys Targaryen. He is one of her bloodriders.
            Aggo was a member of Khal Drogo's khalasar and a member of Daenerys' khas. When Drogo's khalasar fractures, he remains loyal to Daenerys. He pledges his fealty to her after the birth of the dragons. She names him as one of her bloodriders alongside Rakharo and Kovarro.[1]
            Daenerys leads what remains of her khalasar deep into the Red Waste. Facing starvation she sends Rakharo, Aggo, and Kovarro to scout in three different directions, using the last remaining horses. Aggo is sent southeast.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aggo is one of the three bodyguards of Daenerys Targaryen and is named both ko and bloodrider after she hatches her dragon eggs. He's an adept archer who saves Daenerys' life from Cohollo, one of Drogo's bloodriders.
            Following Khal Drogo's death, Aggo and the other two bloodriders Jhogo and Rakharo are among the few who remain with Daenerys. Before entering the funeral pyre, Daenerys gives Aggo the dragonbone bow that was her bride gift and names him her ko. Aggo accepts the bow with lowered eyes, saying "I cannot say these words. Only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko." However, once Daenerys comes out of the pyre alive and with the born dragons, Aggo is the second of the bloodriders to declare "Blood of my blood", and since then he is totally loyal to Daenerys.
            After Daenerys rides Drogon away from Meereen, Aggo and Rakharo go to look for her at the Dothraki sea, instead of Jorah and Daario who are held captive by the Yunkai at that point of the story.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aggo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAggo</string></dict>
        <key>Areo Hotah</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.2.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Areo Hotah was the captain of the Martell guard and the personal bodyguard of Prince Doran Martell, the ruler of Dorne.
            Areo Hotah is originally from Norvos, one of the northern Free Cities. He joined the Martell household at Sunspear along with Prince Doran's wife, a Norvoshi noblewoman. He has been a trusted servant of the Martells for many years, and is renowned for his skill with his halberd.Â Hotah's motto is "Serve, Protect, Obey".
            Areo Hotah is overlooking the Water Gardens with Doran when Ellaria Sand tries to approach the Prince. Hotah blocks her passage, and tells her that the Prince does not wish to be disturbed. In turn, she threatens him, yet Hotah does not move until Prince Doran tells him to let her pass. She berates Doran for doing nothing about his brother's murder, and tells him that she and Oberyn's daughters want Dorne to take up arms and avenge Oberyn. She also wants to harm Myrcella Baratheon in order to send Cersei Lannister a message. Doran strictly forbids her from harming Myrcella while he rules. Ellaria voices doubts that Doran will remain in power if he continues to do nothing, and then storms off. Hotah lets her pass, yet meaningfully indicates his axe to the Prince, but Doran shakes his head and returns his attention to the Water Gardens.[1]
            As Trystane and Myrcella take a walk through the Water Gardens, Areo and Doran watch over them. The prince tells his captain that they need to protect the two, as a betrothal between two Houses who hate each other will only lead to danger for both of them. He asks if Areo remembers how to use his longaxe as it has been a long time since he used it last. Areo assures him that he still remembers how.
            Areo leads the Prince's guard to break up the fight between the Sand Snakes and Jaime Lannister and his accomplice, Bronn, when they try to take Myrcella. Obara angrily claims that they fight for Dorne and asks who he fights for. Areo repeats his command that they drop their weapons. Surrounded and outnumbered, the Sand Snakes obey, though Jaime still hesitates. Areo moves quickly and places his the blade of his longaxe at Jaime's neck, telling Jaime that he would have enjoyed fighting him had Jaime had the use of his right hand. Jaime then drops his sword and the guards take them all into custody. Ellaria Sand is also arrested for her part in the attempted kidnapping.[2]
            Areo later escorts Myrcella to visit Jaime in his chambers, saying that Doran sent her to quiet Jaime's concerns about her safety. Areo takes his leave, and Myrcella proceeds to have a tense conversation with Jaime in which she says that her mother doesn't really care about what she wants, that Dorne is her home now, and she still intends to marry Trystane Martell.[3]
            On Doran's orders, Areo frees Bronn from custody and takes him before his lord. On Trystane Martell's request, Areo strikes Bronn across the face in retaliation for Bronn striking him earlier, in exchange for Bronn being shown mercy.[4]
            Areo is later present when Princess Myrcella departs from Dorne with Jaime and Bronn.[5]
            Areo escorts Prince Doran, along with Ellaria and Tyene Sand to the Water Gardens, assuming a guard posting upon arrival. He watches silently as the prince and paramour exchange compliments and talk of how Oberyn and Doran were well suited for their respective lives. Soon after, Maester Caleotte appears to deliver a message, bearing news of Myrcella's death by poison, which Doran immediately realizes was Ellaria's doing. Before Doran has a chance to react, Tyene Sand stabs and poisons Areo in the spine, killing him instantly in order to leave Doran vulnerable for Ellaria to stab and kill him. From Doran's personal guard, Areo is the only one who is killed in Ellaria's coup, possibly because of his unquestionable loyalty to Doran, while the remaining guards stand and watch Doran bleed to death.[6]
            A small justice is enacted for Areo when Tyene is poisoned by Cersei Lannister.[7]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Areo Hotah is described as a large, broad-shouldered man with white hair. He wields a large axe with a shaft six feet long. He is apparently Caucasian in the books - or at least, the line about his "white hair" inspired official artwork to depict him as Caucasian - while the TV series cast black actor DeObia Oparei in the role. This is not out of keeping for the Free Cities, whose populations are often diverse mixtures descended from Valyrian slaves brought in from far away lands. Westeros.org's review of the casting announcement pointed out that in some ways this could be seen as making up for the omission of Strong Belwas from the TV continuity, who is also a large, black, staunchly loyal guardsman, who entered into the service of Daenerys Targaryen (not that TV-Areo has been "combined" with Strong Belwas: Belwas is huge and strong but also very stout and fat, and is a eunuch).[8]
            As the youngest of six children, Areo was sold to priests of the local religion to be trained as a servant, which is a common practice in the Free Cities - similar to how Thoros, as an eighth son, was given over to the temple of the Lord of Light in Myr. The Bearded Priests of Norvos are a militant order, famed for training young boys into highly dependable guardsmen proficient in combat with an axe. Areo finished his training when he was sixteen years old, and as is customary, his chest was branded with his axe to signify the event.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Areo_Hotah</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAreoHotah</string></dict>
        <key>Argilac Durrandon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.3.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Argilac Durrandon, also known as Argilac the Arrogant, was the last of the Storm Kings, the rulers of the Stormlands since Durran Godsgrief, a legendary figure of the Age of Heroes and founder of Storm's End.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Argilac was the leader of House Durrandon, the rulers of the Stormlands for centuries. After his death, Orys Baratheon took the sigil and words of House Durrandon as those of House Baratheon.
            Argilac got his nickname for arrogantly refusing Aegon's offer of marrying Orys (a bastard) to his daughter, cutting off the hands of Aegon's envoy and sending them back to him. He was also arrogant in engaging the Targaryens in open battle rather than withstanding a siege in the infamously impregnable castle of Storm's End. However, Argilac was motivated in this by having heard of the death of Harren Hoare in similar circumstances at Harrenhal, who prepared for a siege in his immense castle only for the Targaryen dragons to fly right over the walls. If Argilac resisted a siege by Orys it would only be a matter of time until the Targaryens directed their dragons to the castle, so wishing to avoid this fate Argilac met Orys in pitched battle.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Argilac_Durrandon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascArgilacDurrandon</string></dict>
        <key>Arys Oakheart</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.4.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Arys Oakheart[1] is a knight and a member of the Kingsguard and defends King Joffrey Baratheon as he defended King Robert Baratheon before him. He is sent with Princess Myrcella Baratheon to Dorne.
            Ser Arys was among the guards who attacked Eddard Stark when he tried to de-throne King Joffrey.[2] He was also present when Ser Barristan Selmy was dismissed from the brotherhood [3]
            Ser Arys accompanies Princess Myrcella Baratheon as her sworn shield for her journey to Dorne.[4]
            Ser Arys returns to King's Landing after Myrcella's arrival in Dorne and escorts King Tommen in his attempt to enter the Great Sept of Baelor to speak to the High Sparrow about the arrest of Ser Loras Tyrell.[5]
            Ser Arys accompanies Tommen and guards him during his conversation with the High Sparrow.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Arys Oakheart is a member of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard, appointed after his predecessor - whose name hasn't been mentioned - perished during the Greyjoy Rebellion. He's a member of House Oakheart, a noble house from the Reach.
            He is regarded as one of the kinder Knights of the Kingsguard under King Joffrey, objecting at first to Joffrey's orders to beat Sansa Stark, then only hitting her as lightly as he dares. He is also of a much more pleasant demeanor, often engaging in pleasant conversation with the Stark girl.
            Arys remains in Dorne as Myrcella's sworn shield. During this time, Arianne Martell, Prince Doran's daughter and heiress, seduces him. She persuades him to take part in her plan to crown Myrcella to incite war with the Iron Throne in retaliation for the death of Oberyn Martell. The plan is foiled, as Arianne's party is intercepted by Areo Hotah. Ser Arys, bravely but foolishly, charges at the sorrounding soldiers and kills some of them, but is killed by Hotah. During the confusion moments, Myrcella is gravely injured and nearly killed by one of their escorts, Ser Gerold "Darkstar" Dayne.
            Cersei is pleased to hear about Ser Arys's death, for it has created a vacancy at the Kingsguard - which can be filled by her new champion, Ser Robert Strong.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Arys_Oakheart</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascArysOakheart</string></dict>
        <key>Arson Iceaxe</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.5.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Arson, also known as Arson Iceaxe, attempted to cut through the Wall with his axe.
            According to legend, Arson attempted to cut through the Wall with his axe. He had almost cut halfway through by the time the Night's Watch discovered him. Instead of stopping him, they trapped him inside by sealing the way behind him with ice, stone and snow. Some believe that if one presses their ear flat to the Wall, they will be able to hear him chipping away inside.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Arson Iceaxe was a legendary wildling raider who tried to cross the Wall by digging through its base. When he was midway under the ice, he was discovered by a patrol from the Nightfort. Instead of trying to stop the wildling, they decided to wall him in alive. The legend says that by pressing the ear against the Wall, one can still hear the sound of Arson's axe digging away at the ice. Since this time, the Night's Watch sends infrequent patrols along the base of the Wall on its northern face to look for traces of excavation.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Arson_Iceaxe</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascArsonIceaxe</string></dict>

            Allo is present during the speech Lord Commander Jeor Mormont gave to the "graduating" recruits. He is assigned to the Builders.[1]

        <key>Arryk Cargyll</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.7.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Arryk Cargyll was a renowned knight, and member of the Kingsguard who fought and died in the Dance of the Dragons, as well as the twin of SerÂ Erryk Cargyll.
            Ser Arryk was the twin brother of Ser Erryk Cargyll, who was also a member of the Kingsguard.
            Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk Cargyll are mentioned as being twin brothers who ended up on opposite sides of the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. The twin brothers supposedly met on the field of battle, and died at each others hand with tears on their cheeks.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Arryk Cargyll was also the twin brother of Ser Erryk, and both were knights in Viserys I's Kingsguard.
            When Aegon II Targaryen usurped the throne ahead of his sister Rhaenyra, and was crowned king by Lord Commander Criston Cole himself, it split the realm and the Kingsguard itself: three other Kingsguard sided with Aegon II and Ser Criston, but three others fled to join Rhaenyra's Queensgard. Ser Arryk sided with Aegon II, while Ser Erryk sided with Rhaenyra.
            Eventually, Ser Arryk was sent to infiltrate Rhaenyra's base of power at Dragonstone castle, pretending to be his twin brother, but he happened to run into Erryk in a hallway. In the ensuing duel, each brother died at the point of the other's sword. In some ways it was a microcosm of the entire Dance of the Dragons: a destructive civil war that set brother against brother, and for which there was no winner but mutual destruction.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Arryk_Cargyll</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascArrykCargyll</string></dict>
        <key>Aron Santagar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.8.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Aron Santagar was a member of House Santagar, a knightly house of Dorne.
            Ser Aron is present at a court session in the Red Keep in which Janos Slynt is created Lord Slynt and given the castle of Harrenhal and later Ser Barristan Selmy is dismissed from the Kingsguard. When Sansa Stark appears to ask for mercy for her father, she greets Ser Aron, though the knight turns away.[1]
            Ser Aron dies during the riots in King's Landing.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Aron Santagar is the Master-at-Arms of the Red Keep. He is Dornish, as revealed in the fourth novel, and is described by Ser Rodrik Cassel as a vain but honest man. In the first book, Ser Aron is secretly approached by Ser Rodrik to see if he might recognize the dagger used by the assassin sent to murder Bran Stark. He also participates in the Tourney of the Hand.
            Upon their arrival inÂ King's Landing,Â TyrionÂ sends Podrick to SerÂ Aron for training. Pod's training comes to an end when Ser Aron is killed.
            Ser Aron perishes in the Riot of King's Landing. In the episode several courtiers are shown to be attacked by the rioting mob; it is unclear if any of these were meant to be Ser Aron.
            While Ser Aron died in the second novel, as of the fifth novel not specific replacement for him as Master-of-Arms at the Red Keep has been mentioned.
            Tommen, who has befriended Loras Tyrell, tells his mother he wishes Loras to be the newÂ Master-of-Arms. Jaime thinks too that Loras is a good choice, but Cersei - who deeply loathes all the Tyrells - refuses to hear about it, and contemplates about appointing a Dornish for the office (because that would annoy the Tyrells).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aron_Santagar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAronSantagar</string></dict>
        <key>Andros</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.9.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Andros was a merchant lord and ambassador for House Whitehill.
            Andros is sent along with Morgryn by Lord Ludd Whitehill to King's Landing in order to negotiate a sell of ironwood with the Master of Coin Tyrion Lannister. After an hour of waiting in the Red Keep, the two ambassadors are introduced to Mira Forrester. Andros is very unhappy with this, claiming that House Forrester has no business selling ironwood to the crown, and demanding that any sale of ironwood go through House Whitehill. Morgryn tries to calm Andros down, but Tyrion ends his meeting with them in order to deal directly with Mira. After attempting to threaten Mira, Andros leaves the Red Keep angry.[1]
            Andros attends Tommen Baratheon's coronation festival. He converses with another man about how he pushed Morgryn out of the ironwood deal and is now Ludd Whitehill's exclusive contact in King's Landing. He later notices Mira Forrester conversing with Lyman Lannister, his new business partner, and berates him for speaking with the enemy. However, Mira convinces Lyman to reveal that Andros is hiring an army of sellswords for Ludd, large enough to march against Ironrath. Lyman then confronts Andros for revealing his addiction to milk of the poppy, and angrily ends their partnership. Figuring that Mira was the cause, Andros threatens the handmaiden before walking off, visibly red.[2]
            Cersei Lannister learns of Mira's confrontation with Andros at the coronation festival, and mentions it during her meeting with the handmaiden. She later offers to "take care" of Mira's problem with Andros if she can discover who Tyrion plans to call as witnesses during his trial, heavily implying that she will have the merchant lord killed.
            If Rodrik later lets the traitor live, he reveals that Mira's actions in King's Landing prevented Andros' attempt to gather an army for the Whitehills from succeeding.[3]
            Lord Morgryn tells Mira that Andros has been imprisoned in the Black Cells. He was later executed in front of Mira or Tom

        <key>Josera Snow</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.10.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Josera Snow is the bastard son of Lord Gregor ForresterÂ and the brother of Elsera Snow, both of whom live in the North Grove. He is a wargÂ that controls a snow bearÂ named Shadow.
            Josera and Elsera, as the bastard children of Gregor, were his hidden shame. Because of this, he sent them beyond the Wall to the North Grove to protect it.
            As they approach the North Grove, Gared, Cotter, and Sylvi are attacked by Josera's snow bear, Shadow. They manage to fend it off long enough to reach the grove, where his sister Elsera forces him to stop attacking the group. The three newcomers are held at knifepoint, until Gared reveals that he was sent by House Forrester. Josera disbelieves his claim, even after he presents proof, but Elsera urges her brother to trust the squire. The two give their names, and Gared then reveals that he came to the North Grove because of Gregor's last words to him. Josera is shocked to learn of Gregor's death, and angered that Gared doesn't know the identity of himself and his sister. Before they have time to talk further, the group learns of wights approaching the grove and move to defend it. Josera has Sylvi tied up, but Gared can convince him to free her. They then move to confront the threat.
            One of Elsera's soldiers then stops obeying her orders, and attacks her. Josera moves to kill it, but Elsera manages to get it under control. Josera tells Gared that she controls the soldiers through blood magic, and that her power over them is growing weaker. Now aware of Gregor's death and the peril House Forrester faces, Josera expresses a desire to abandon the North Grove and march south to help his family.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Josera_Snow</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJoseraSnow</string></dict>

        <key>Kraznys mo Nakloz</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.12.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kraznys mo Nakloz was a slave-trader in the city of Astapor, on the coast of Slaver's Bay, and one of the Good Masters, the ruling elite of the city. He was an immensely wealthy individual who grew rich from the training and trading of the Unsullied warrior-eunuchs.
            Kraznys mo Nakloz is one of the Good Masters, the ruling elite of the city of Astapor, composed of slave traders. As with many of his compatriots, Kraznys only speaks a Low Valyrian dialect and does not know the Common Tongue of Westeros. Thus when dealing with foreign customers, Kraznys relies on his slave Missandei to serve as his translator.[1]
            Kraznys, with Missandei at his side, meets with Daenerys Targaryen and shows her some of his Unsullied. These Unsullied had been standing for an entire day without being given food or water. Through Missandei, Kraznys explains the Unsullied are trained to fight from the age of five and that only one in four recruits survives the training. To demonstrate that the Unsullied do not fear pain or death, he slices off the nipple of one soldier in the presence of his prospective customers. He then adds that the Unsullied are also trained to show no mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training. Kraznys tells her that eight thousand soldiers are for sale and that she has one day until the next day to make a decision. Throughout the meeting, Kraznys insults Daenerys, believing that she doesn't understand Valyrian. Missandei translates Kraznys insult-laden sentences into more respectable phrases.[1]
            The following day, Daenerys meets with Kraznys and two other Good Masters, Greizhen mo Ullhor being one of the other two. Kraznys is initially dismissive of her offer to buy all eight thousand Unsullied and the boys in training, claiming that she can afford barely more than one hundred Unsullied. In response, Daenerys states that she has dragons. After some haggling, Kraznys reluctantly agrees to sell her all of his Unsullied in return for Drogon. In addition, Daenerys demands to have Missandei as a token. Eager to possess a dragon of his own, Kraznys agrees. He also agrees to let Daenerys have Missandei as a gift. [2]
            Kraznys and his fellow Good Masters are present at one of Astapor's plazas to consummate the transaction and see the dragon for themselves. All the Unsullied soldiers are also assembled. Daenerys and her entourage arrive with Drogon in a cage. Kraznys tells Daenerys that the Unsullied had not seen combat before and advises her to "blood them early" by having them attack some minor cities and towns before proceeding to Westeros. He offers to purchase any healthy slaves that she may capture and some of these would even be trained as Unsullied. Daenerys hands Drogon, who is wearing a long chain leash, to Kraznys, who gives her a scourge with a harpy-shaped hilt, signifying ownership of the Unsullied. This symbolic gesture concludes the transaction.[3]
            While Kraznys struggles to control Drogon, Daenerys addresses the Unsullied in Valyrian and tests them with battle commands. Kraznys then complains to Daenerys that the dragon is not obeying his commands. In response, Daenerys retorts in perfect Valyrian that "a dragon is not a slave". Kraznys is surprised that Daenerys speaks Valyrian, Daenerys declares that she is Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria: Valyrian is her mother-tongue, and thus she has understood every word he said to her.[3]
            Daenerys orders the Unsullied to kill all of the Good Masters in Astapor, along with all of their household soldiers and any man who holds a whip, to spare only the children and to liberate all slaves. As the Unsullied turn on the slave-drivers, Kraznys frantically shouts for someone to kill Daenerys but the Unsullied, no longer his, ignore him. Daenerys turns back to Krazyns and calmly speaks one word: "dracarys". Drogon then breathes fire onto Kraznys, completely engulfing the slaver in flames. Following the Sack of Astapor, Kraznys' charred remains are left unburied.[3]
            Kraznys was first mentioned in relationship to the news of the casting of Missandei,[4] and it was assumed he would appear. This was confirmed on 18 August 2012 when it was announced he would be played by Dan Hildebrand.[5].
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Kraznys is one of the "Good Masters", the heads of the noble and wealthy slave-trading families, of the city of Astapor, dwelling in an immense pyramid. He is described as having an oiled red and black beard and being so fat that Daenerys thinks he has bigger breasts than hers. He is disdainful for anyone not born of Ghiscari blood and considers his people and heritage to be superior to anyone else's, even that of Valyria, while dismissing the Westerosi as "sunset savages".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Kraznys_mo_Nakloz</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascKraznysmoNakloz</string></dict>

        <key>Malcolm Branfield</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.16.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Malcolm Branfield is the brother of Lady Elissa Forrester. He is a member of House Forrester's household, and last male of the Branfield line. After his nephew Ethan was killed by Ramsay Snow, Malcolm was sent to Essos to retrieve his nephew Asher and to look for an army to help fight against House Whitehill. He is now in service to Daenerys Targaryen after retrieving his nephew from Essos. After the death of his sister, Elissa, in the Battle of Ironrath. Malcolm is now the only surviving member of House Branfield.
            
            As a young man, Malcolm was the black sheep of the Branfield family. He liked to roam the countryside in the style of a hedge knight, refusing his fatherâs offers of marriage and lands. Malcolm fought bravely alongside his brothers when House Branfield fell; yet he and his sister were the only two survivors. Malcolm now lives with Lady Elissaâs new family at Ironrath, though he still tends to disappear for weeks at a stretch. Malcolm has fathered no children, thus he is the last of the Branfield line.[1]
            The episode opens to Malcolm and Asher waiting for Beskha to return from checking if the Lost Legion were still after them. Malcolm expresses his doubt that Beskha can be trusted and exclaims that she is costing them invaluable time - time they need in order to get back to Talia and Ryon. The group continues to travel along the ravine until their path is blocked by some rubble. Malcolm suggests searching for a cave, to which Beskha will agree with if her opinion is asked. When prompted, Malcolm will explain to Asher that the reason he is so distrustful and harsh towards Beskha is because she is "immaterial" compared to Asher; Asher is his main focus and only concern during the mission.
            Finding their way into Meereen, Malcolm helps Asher persuade an old friend, Croft, to help them bring back an army. If he was not helped, Malcolm will inquire Asher about his decision to help Beskha instead of him, saying that he could not have known they would both make it out alive. Malcolm will be disappointed and hurt, but will continue on his mission with him nonetheless. While Croft cannot help them as he swore loyalty to the Khaleesi, Malcolm and the others knowledge of where her missing dragon is helps them set up a meeting with the Queen herself. The episode ends with Malcolm, Asher, and Beskha entering Daenerys tent and coming face-to-face with her for the first time.[4]
            If Asher does not say this first, Malcolm will suggest that they fight alongside of her with the aid of Beskha's knowledge of the city. Beskha is angered by this, as she despises Meereen for unknown reasons. Despite the animosity between Malcolm and Beskha because of this outburst, Daenerys takes the trio up on their offer, promising that she will consider helping them if she is successful in her mission. Malcolm is told by Daenerys to stay behind as Asher and Beskha leave. Malcolm's final appearance of the episode is a shot of him watching Asher and Beskha leave from inside the tent as the flap closes.
            While he is not present for the attack on Meereen, his name is mentioned throughout the episode. It is Malcolm's suggestion of relying on Beskha for the mission that triggers her memories of being enslaved inside the city as a child. It is assumed that Malcolm is unaware of this as he was not around for this breakdown.[5]
            Before Asher, Beskha, and Malcolm can leave, Daenerys says she has other plans for Malcolm, much to the confusion of Asher's group. She wishes Malcolm to stay and serve her. He cites that he owes allegiance to his family, but Daenerys counters that they will be grateful for the alliance with her that he helped forge. He asks to discuss it with Asher, which she agrees, but pleads with him to give her his answer soon.
            Asher is shocked that Malcolm would consider staying in Essos. Malcolm counters that Daenerys is someone they would want on their side if she ever came to Westeros. Malcolm also notes that Asher made a good start with her and he could strengthen that bond. He argues that she takes the Iron Throne, she would be the only ally they need. While Asher and Beskha go off to acquire pit fighters, he goes to further discuss with the queen.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Malcolm_Branfield</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMalcolmBranfield</string></dict>
        <key>Luthor Tyrell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.17.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Luthor Tyrell was the father of Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden and the head of House Tyrell. He was survived by his widow Olenna Tyrell, known as the "Queen of Thorns".[1][2]
            In his youth, Luthor was expected to marry Viola Redwyne. The night before he was due to propose to her, however, Viola's sister Olenna "stumbled" upon his bedchamber after allegedly getting lost after her embroidery lesson. The next morning, Luthor did not propose to Viola; in fact, he never left his chamber, as he couldn't walk, and could only think of what Olenna had given him the night before.[3]
            Lord Luthor's widow, Lady Olenna, describes her late husband toÂ Sansa StarkÂ as "an oaf". Â She explains that her husband died when he rodeÂ over a cliff while hawking. He had been looking up and not paying attention to where his horse was going. She used the incident as a metaphor for the Tyrells' alliance with the Lannisters.[4]
            After Joffrey is poisoned and dies right in front of Margaery, she is left somewhat shaken. Days later, wearing mourning clothes, Olenna recalls to her that Luthor was an oaf she had to sit through boring banquets with and produce heirs with - but it was still horrifying after he died in his hunting accident, when they brought him back and she saw his lifeless corpse laid out on a table. Olenna seems uncharacteristically a little upset, though she tries to hide it, as she clearly didn't rejoice when Luthor died.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Luthor Tyrell's backstory remains the same, except that it was planned for him to marry Shaera Targaryen, a member of House Targaryen, who was cut out in the show to simplify the Targaryen-dynasty, and not another Redwyne.
            After a short conversation with Olenna, Tyrion Lannister wondered if Luthor deliberately rode off that cliff.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Luthor_Tyrell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLuthorTyrell</string></dict>
        <key>Mago</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.18.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mago was a rider in Khal Drogo's khalasar.
            Mago attends Drogo's wedding to the Westerosi exile Daenerys Targaryen. He watches as two warriors squabble over a dancer at the wedding.[1]
            Mago objects to Daenerys intervening and denying the Dothraki to take their share of the Lhazareen women as spoils of war. He refuses to recognize her authority as khaleesi, calling her a foreign whore, and also defies Drogo. The Khal fights him, disdainfully disarming himself and deliberately accepting an arakh wound to show contempt for Mago's combat skills before slitting his throat with his own weapon and then pulling his tongue out through the neck wound.[2]
            Shortly after Mago's death, the wound he gave Drogo begins to fester, eventually leading to Drogo's incapacitation and subsequent death.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mago is part of Khal Drogo's khalasar, serving under Ko Jhaqo. He complains to Drogo that Daenerys deprived him of his rape victim, a Lhazareen girl named Eroeh (who does not appear in the TV show) - but does not defy or fight with Drogo after the latterÂ orally denying him.Â Drogo is not injured by Mago, but during a battle against the khalasar of Khal Ogo.
            Following Drogo's death, Mago becomes a bloodrider for Jhaqo, one of the several Kos that proclaim themselves Khals, followed by a portion of Drogo's Khalasar. He seizes Eroeh, rapes her and gives her to his new Khal. Jhaqo gives her to his other six bloodriders, who gang-rape her, and finally cut her throat. When Daenerys hears about this, she swears furiously that she will pay both Mago and Jhaqo back for what they did to Eroeh. So far she has not had a chance to fulfill her oath.
            In the DVD commentary for the episode "The Pointy End", George R.R. Martin comments on the "butterfly effect" created when a character is killed off in the TV series, given that Mago continues to appear in the books.
            In an interview dated July 12, 2011, Martin confirmed that Mago would be a recurring character in the sixth book.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mago</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMago</string></dict>
        <key>Mandon Moore</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.19.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>SerÂ Mandon Moore was a member of the Kingsguard and defended King Joffrey Baratheon as he defended King Robert Baratheon before him.
            Ser Mandon Moore is a member of House Moore, a noble house from the Vale.
            Ser Mandon was among the Kingsguard that attacked Eddard Stark when he tried to de-throne King Joffrey.[1] He was also present when Ser Barristan Selmy was dismissed from the Kingsguard.[2]
            Ser Mandon stands guard during a dinner held by Queen Cersei and Tyrion Lannister during which CerseiÂ claims toÂ have imprisoned Tyrion's lover/whore. The Queen orders the knight to bring her before them. Ser Mandon and one of his sworn brothers then bring in Ros, whom Cersei mistook for Tyrion's lover (which was actually Shae).[3]
            Immediately prior to the Battle of the Blackwater, Ser Mandon informs Queen Cersei of a groom and two maids attempting to flee with a stolen horse and some gold cups. The Queen orders Ser Mandon to have Ilyn Payne put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.[4]
            During the battle, Ser Mandon and Ser Boros Blount remain at the side of King Joffrey as he oversees the city's defenses alongside Tyrion Lannister, the Hand of the King. When the forces of Stannis Baratheon reach the city and begin invading it, Joffrey departs for the safety of the Red Keep, at the urge of Queen Cersei, and orders Ser Mandon and Ser Boros to aid Tyrion.[4]
            Tyrion urges a host of men-at-arms to help him fight the invaders and orders Ser Mandon and Ser Boros to join him in leading the battle. Ser Mandon is also ordered to carry the royal banner. In the midst of battle, Ser Mandon attempts to murder Tyrion, right after Tyrion thought he was safe and took his own helmet off. Ser Mandon narrowly misses making a killing stroke, by mere inches â the stroke only succeeded in badly slashing Tyrion across the face. Mandon readies to kill Tyrion with a second swordstroke but is then killed byÂ Tyrion's squire, Podrick Payne, who drives a lance through the back of his head.[4]
            While pondering over their new forced marriages, Tyrion asks Cersei whether or not she employed Ser Mandon to kill him while on the Blackwater. She refuses to reply and Tyrion suspects King Joffrey to be the one who gave the order.[5]
            During their mission to locate Sansa Stark, Brienne asks Podrick if he did anything remotely related to combat while he squired for Tyrion. He proceeds to tell Brienne how he killed Ser Mandon to protect Tyrion during the Battle of the Blackwater.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mandon Moore is a member of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard. Jaime Lannister considers him the most dangerous after himself because his face gives nothing away.
            Very little is known about Ser Mandon. He came from the Vale and was brought to King's Landing by Lord Jon Arryn. Robert Baratheon made him a member of the Kingsguard, but neither Robert or even Jon loved him very much - possibly implying that Jon brought him from the Vale at Lysa Arryn's request. In turn, this would suggest that Lysa was influenced to make this request by Petyr Baelish, and therefore that Mandon may have actually been one of Littlefinger's agents, but there is no evidence to prove that.
            Ser Mandon was never close to his fellow members of the Kingsguard. Barristan Selmy said of him that he had no friends but his sword and no life but duty. Jaime Lannister regarded him as a dangerous man, but not a man others would follow.
            When Tyrion arrives in King's Landing to take his place as Hand of the King, accompanied by Bronn and Timett, Ser Mandon bars his way to the small council chamber and steadfastly refuses to let him through, stating that Cersei has ordered that no one be admitted. Tyrion mentions that Bronn slew Ser Vardis Egen, whom Ser Mandon knew, in single combat, which also has no effect. As Tyrion ponders whether to use force, Ser Mandon agrees to let him pass and Tyrion is relieved to have survived his first test as Hand unscathed. While he is confident that Bronn and Timett could have killed Ser Mandon if necessary, killing a member of the Kingsguard would have been an inauspicious start to his tenure. This confrontation was omitted from the TV series; Tyrion simply strolls into the chamber.
            In A Clash of Kings, Ser Mandon is not present when Cersei reveals Tyrion she has captured the whore she believes to be his lover. In the books, Ser Mandon is also killed by Podrick Payne, but Pod shoves him into Blackwater Bay as he attempts to assassinate Tyrion Lannister; Moore is dragged underwater by the weight of his armor and drowns.
            Tyrion believes that Ser Mandon tried to kill him at Cersei's orders, but cannot find any link or evidence. He attempts to obtain some information about Ser Mandon from Varys, but Varys reveals only what Tyrion already knows; Tyrion wonders if Varys knows rather more than he says, though. He does not make any more inquires afterwards.
            When Jaime assumes his duties as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, he notices that the White Book needs to updated about the death of Ser Mandon. This is the last reference to him in the novels.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mandon_Moore</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMandonMoore</string></dict>
        <key>Luwin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.20.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Luwin was the Maester of Winterfell and a loyal servant to House Stark. He acted as a surrogate parent to Bran Stark and Rickon Stark in the absence of their family.
            Luwin is a Maester, a learned man of science and medicine, and serves House Stark of Winterfell. House Stark are Lords Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Luwin is very loyal to the Starks and they value his wise counsel and experience. He delivered all five of Lady Catelyn's children. He serves as a tutor to the male children.[1]
            Luwin organizes the preparations for a royal visit with Catelyn Stark. Catelyn spots Bran climbing Winterfell's walls and scolds her son in front of Luwin. Luwin stands behind the Starks as King Robert arrives. The next night Luwin delivers a letter from Lysa Arryn to Catelyn and Eddard Stark. He discusses its content with them and counsels that given Lysa's claims that the Lannisters killed Jon Arryn it is important that Eddard take up Robert's offer to make him Hand of the King. Bran is injured in what seems to have been a climbing accident.[2]
            Luwin tends to Bran's injuries and predicts that he will survive. Eddard goes to King's Landing to serve as hand and takes many of his retainers with him. Luwin goes to Catelyn to discuss finances and appointing replacements. Catelyn is distraught over Bran's condition and refuses to participate. Robb Stark agrees to work with Luwin instead. An assassin attempts to kill Bran but is foiled by Bran's direwolf Summer. Luwin meets with Catelyn, Robb, Theon Greyjoy, and Rodrik Cassel in the Gods Wood of Winterfell to discuss the circumstances of Bran's injury. Catelyn reveals that she found a blond hair inside the tower where he was found. Luwin cautions restraint and Catelyn plans to go south personally to deliver the news to Eddard. Bran awakens after she leaves[3] but is paralyzed from the waist down.[4]
            Luwin meets with Tyrion Lannister in the main hall of Winterfell alongside Robb. They offer a cool reception until Tyrion provides plans for a saddle that would allow Bran to ride.[5] Luwin tutors Bran on the regions and families in the Seven Kingdoms and notes that amongst House Greyjoy's noted skills is a tendency towards failed rebellions. Bran is upset at the continued absence of his parents and sullenly tries to provoke Luwin.[6]
            Luwin warns off Theon Greyjoy from Osha, a wildling prisoner captured near the castle. He then questions Osha himself. She claims that the White Walkers are on the move. He dismisses this as a fable, but Osha tells him that the Walkers were not wiped out thousands of years ago, but have merely been asleep. She claims that they are not asleep any more.[7]
            Eddard is arrested for treason after the death of Robert. A letter from Sansa reaches Winterfell, pleading with a disbelieving Robb to bend the knee to Joffrey Baratheon. Maester Luwin correctly identifies the letter as the work of Queen Cersei. Robb refuses to consider the request and sends out ravens, summoning Eddard's lords bannermen to assemble their armies at Winterfell.[8] Robb marches south leaving Luwin to care for Bran. Eddard is executed for treason on King Joffrey's orders.[9] Luwin tells Bran and Rickon the news of Eddard's death.[10]
            As Maester at Winterfell, he becomes ever more of a father-figure to Bran and Rickon with their father dead and their mother away. He provides council to Bran as he acts as Lord of Winterfell.[11] Bran questions Luwin about his strange dreams and Luwin reveals to him the valyrian steel link in his Maester chain, the sign that he studied the "higher mysteries" - magic - and asserts that if magic ever existed it has left their world long ago.[12]
            Theon Greyjoy, who was last seen riding off with Robb, later returns to Winterfell with a crew of fellow ironborn. They lure the garrison of Winterfell away by feinting at Torrhen's Square[13] and then seize the poorly defended castle.[14] Luwin is able to send word to King Robb Stark before being captured. Theon assembles Luwin and the rest of Winterfell's inhabitant in the courtyard where he has Bran publicly surrender the castle to him. He then turns to Luwin and orders him to send ravens to his father and sister, informing them of his victory. Upon noticing Luwin's icy stare, Theon asks Luwin if he remembers his oath to serve the Lord of Winterfell. Luwin grudgingly replies he does, and Theon reminds him that he is now the Lord of Winterfell and repeats his order. Luwin walks off to do as he is told but then Ser Rodrik Cassel, Winterfell's castellan and master-at-arms, is forcefully brought forward to Theon by Lorren and another ironborn. When Theon sentences Ser Rodrik to death after the latter openly spits in his face, Luwin tries to convince Theon not to make a hasty decision and that Ser Rodrik is worth more to him alive than dead. Theon briefly considers Luwin's advice but ultimately dismisses him, threatening to have him executed as well if he doesn't back down. Theon then proceeds to execute Ser Rodrik to the horror of Bran, Luwin, and the rest of Winterfell's inhabitants.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Luwin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLuwin</string></dict>

Rodrik became head of House Forrester and Lord of Ironrath after the death of his father.
            When Rodrik was young he often played Monsters and maidens with Namond and Meghan, friends from his childhood and he still remembers growing up around lumberers who were cutting down ironwood trees. As he got older Rodrik was later betrothed to Elaena Glenmore, whose father is lord of House Glenmore and Rillwater Crossing, and often played hide and seek with her in the ironwood grove where she would always hide behind the same tree so Rodrik would find her. Rodrik was also trained from a young age to take on the burden of leadership. Heâs a man built for the position, a formidable presence both on and off the battlefieldâbut when Robb Stark called his banners to war, Rodrik was asked by his father to stay and protect their home, Ironrath. Rodrik refused, riding out into battle with his father and leading the Forrester army into battle with such force that he is now feared among the Lannister soldiers.[1]
            Along with the rest of Robb Stark's army, Rodrik and his house attends Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey's wedding at the Twins. Once "The Rains of Castamere" song begins, an unexpected massacre, the Red Wedding, begins at the hands of the Freys, slaughtering the remaining northern army camped outside the Twins. As Rodrik valiantly fights off Frey soldiers, his father's squire - Gared Tuttle - attempts to run to his aid. Before he can reach him, Rodrik is stabbed in the back of the leg followed by having a horse fall on him supposedly killing him and leavingÂ House Forrester leaderless in the process.[2]
            Rodrik awakens to find himself being towed on a corpse cart along with several other bodies, including his father.
            The cart then arrive at Ironrath to which no one notices his movement, until he forces himself out of the cart as it leaves and is then noticed by Ser Royland, who orders to fetch the Maester as he passes out.
            Rodrik awakens to find himself in a mid-surgery, when Maester Ortengryn notices that Rodrik is awake he gives him Milk of the Poppy, the player can decide to drink the milk or not. right after that he sees his mother before passing out again, he then wakes up in his room, Talia is beside him, practicing her singing, she tells him that their brother Ethan is dead and their other brother Ryon is captured, to which he is gravely upset.
            Rodrik with the help of Talia slowly makes his way to the Great Hall to discuss the Whitehill soldiers residing within their walls. Lady Forrester announces that Rodrik's betrothed Lady Elaena Glenmore has been invited to see him.
            A while later, Elaena Glenmore arrives and discusses with Rodrik about the future between their two houses, whether or not they still intend to marry depends on how well Rodrik handles the conversation. Their meeting is interrupted by Lord Whitehill who overrules Rodrik about taking all the Ironwood forests, and defying House Bolton in the process.
            Rodrik is last seen attending the funeral of his father and brother Ethan, with his mother, his sister Talia, Ser Royland, Duncan Tuttle, Maester Ortengryn, his brother Ryon or Gwyn Whitehill (player-determined) and the little army Ironrath has, he gives a farewell speech to those present before listening to Talia's now finished song for the fallen two.[3]
            Rodrik wakes up after dreaming of the Red Wedding and hears soldiers banging on to their shields. Gryff Whitehill introduces himself and says that they will stay in the Great Hall of House Forrester. Rodrik can choose to stop them or let them pass.
            After, they meet as a council to discuss a plan to either exile Gryff or save Ryon. Whichever they choose does not matter due to something that happens later. In private, Duncan speaks with Rodrik to plan a meeting with Gwyn Whitehill. Rodrik meets with Gwyn Whitehill privately. She tells them about that her father knows about their plans due to there being a traitor in their council. Rodrik leaves once Whitehill men approach the area.
            At the great hall, the next day - Rodrik and his mother are in the Great Hall after it was ransacked. Rodrik can choose to reveal about his knowledge of their being a traitor in the Council. Four men come in and re-enact Ethan's death. Rodrik can choose to strike the soldier with a cup or restrain himself. Later on, Gryff grabs Talia and says that she attacked a man. Gryff throws Talia into the mud while Rodrik can attack Gryff. Rodrik is knocked down and is given the choice to stay down or get up. He gets the choice three times after Rodrik consistently kept getting punched by Gryff. Rodrik can end up standing up to Gryff valiantly, and earning respect from his house but angering Gryff, or stay down and have Gryff's guard lowered. Gryff warns that "This isn't over" and walks away. In a tower, Talia and Rodrik are speaking about what Rodrik did with Gryff. Talia says she will do anything to protect her family.

            Royland Degore joined Lord Forresterâs army after his family was murdered by Ironborn during Balon Greyjoyâs rebellion. Degore had a natural grasp of military tactics and strategy. As the story goes, Degore led a nighttime raid on Sea Dragon Point, where he cut the moorings of a dozen Greyjoy longships and burned the drifting ships to ash - along with all the Ironborn on board. Degore was given charge of a battalion and came to play a crucial role in the Siege of Pyke that ended the war. In the months that followed, King Robert awarded Royland a knighthood and Lord Forrester asked him to serve as Ironrathâs Master-at-Arms. Ser Royland still holds the position and is known for his military expertiseâ¦ as well as his legendary temper.[1][2]
            Royland is entering the great hall, arguing with Duncan Tuttle, about what to do with Gared, who had killed one Bolton and determinately one Whitehill for murdering his family. He affirms that now is the time that House Forrester needs to demonstrate its strength and reminds Duncan that the murders happened on their land, on their people, on Duncan's own family. Duncan, despite what happened to his family, disagrees, believing it's not the time to provoke the Whitehills, especially with Ramsay Snow coming to Ironrath to see them to bend the knee. Royland curses Ramsay Snow.
            Duncan turns his attention to his nephew, telling him of the retribution Ramsay will want for Gared's justice. Royland angrily states that House Forrester should be demand retribution and it happened on Forrester land. When Duncan states they need to be smart, Royland accuses him of having the house do nothing. Duncan replies that they should use their heads while they're still attached to their shoulders. Royland than asks Gared to talk some sense into his uncle.
            Duncan turns to the fire, admitting it's for Lord Ethan to decide. Royland scoffs at this, knowing Ethan to be a boy who can barely hold a sword and knows nothing of how to lead men. Duncan tells Gared that the Boltons will accuse him of murder, which Royland responds that Gared has done nothing wrong. When the threat of annihilation by Ramsay is brought up, Royland states he like to see them try.
            When Duncan declares that Gared cannot stay, much to Royland's shock. Duncan suggests that there is one place House Bolton couldn't reach Gared, Royland announces in surpise that Duncan intends to send Gared to the Wall, even though Royland believes Gared has done nothing wrong. When it is decided, Royland sadly looks at Gared and Duncan before agreeing and quietly leaving the hall.
            While Ethan, Talia and Ryon are outside playing, Ryon reveals that Ser Royland said Ethan couldn't fight well, and called him a milksop. The master-at-arms calls out to them informing Ethan that Lord Whitehill has come to Ironrath unsuspected and that he is demanding justice for the men Gared killed, and that he wants a audience with the lord in the great hall immediately. Before the rival lord enters, Royland reminds Ethan to not give the Whitehill any satisfaction, as they were clearly in the wrong, and even though the Whitehills have five times as many men and the backing of House Bolton, only cowards and dead men roll over.
            During the meeting, Ser Royland is present at Ethan's right side, and reminds Lord Whitehill that Roose Bolton is the Warden of the North, and he and Ludd glare at each other. If you stand up to Lord Whitehill as Ethan, Royland will tell Lady Forrester that he was wrong about Ethan and praise that he stood up to him as a true lord.
            Right before Ethan is leaves to ask for advice for who should be the new Sentinel, Royland comes with Erik, a Forrester man-at-arms who was caught stealing weapons, when he was supposed to be guarding him. He is rough with Erik, knocking him down several times, and wants Ethan to choose his punishment. While Erik rants on how he hasn't been paid, and that the house is doomed, Degore hits him, temporarily silencing him. While discussing which punishment to mete, Royland reminds him that Lord Gregor took a three of a thief's fingers, and that the men can't do whatever they please. After that, he is outside training his men in combat.
            While asking people who should be Sentinel, Royland is training his men. When asked about the house's defenses, the ones he is training aren't, but they will, and Ethan has to project power. He also states that he can hold the reins and wield a sword, and Duncan set Gared to the Wall. Ethan's uncle Malcolm Branfield because Royland is a warrior and gives discipline and has the respect of his men, while Talia Forrester believes he is unpredictable and likely to make matters worse.
            If you choose Royland as your sentinel, he will praise Ethan's decision. During the meeting, he believes if they put everyone who can hold a spear or crossbow on the wall, that should intimate Ramsay, and proposes that they make Ramsay wait outside Ironrath until Ethan let's him in.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Royland_Degore</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRoylandDegore</string></dict>
        <key>Mace Tyrell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.25.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Mace Tyrell was the Lord of Highgarden and head of House Tyrell. He was the father of Loras and Margaery Tyrell, and the son of Olenna Tyrell. He initially supported Renly Baratheon's claim to the Iron Throne in the War of the Five Kings, but after Renly's death he successfully negotiated an alliance with House Lannister to support King Joffrey's claim to the throne, on the condition that his daughter Margaery would marry Joffrey, making her the new queen and giving House Tyrell the prestige of entering into the royal bloodline. He was appointed both Master of Ships and Master of Coin on King Tommen's small council.
            He, along with his children, died during the Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor orchestrated by Cersei Lannister.
            Mace Tyrell is the Lord of Highgarden and head of House Tyrell, one of the Great Houses of Westeros. He is the Lord Paramount of the Reach and Warden of the South. The Tyrells are one of the richest and most powerful families in Westeros, second only to the Lannisters - for while the mountains of the Westerlands possess rich gold mines, the fields of the Reach are the most fertile in Westeros, capable of supporting armies almost twice the size of any other kingdom.
            Mace is not considered a great strategist or general himself - his own mother Olenna openly describes him as an oaf, though not out of spite. On the other hand, he has shown good judgment in delegating such tasks to trusted, skilled subordinates, such as the famous general Randyll Tarly, who often commands Mace's forces in battle.
            Mace might not be the most intelligent man, but he is an amiable fellow well-liked by most of his bannermen, as well a loving husband and father. Mace has one son, Loras, and a daughter, Margaery, arguably the most eligible woman in the Seven Kingdoms. Mace hopes to make a good match for her to increase the already considerable power and influence of his family.[1][2][3] Mace is particularly eager for Margaery to secure a royal marriage for their family because unlike some of the other Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms such as the Starks or Lannisters, the Tyrells never ruled as kings in their own right, but were granted control of the Reach as a reward for submitting to Aegon the Conqueror during the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years ago. Thus entering into the royal bloodline would increase House Tyrell's prestige and secure their rule over their fractious vassals in the Reach.[4]
            During Robert's Rebellion, Mace and House Tyrell stayed loyal to House Targaryen. The Tyrells owed their rule over Highgarden and the Reach to the Targaryen kings, who after the Targaryen Conquest three centuries before had awarded rule of the Reach to the Tyrells ahead of other families from the region which actually had better claims (such as House Florent). The Tyrell armies were able to inflict the only defeat that Robert Baratheon suffered during the entire war at the Battle of Ashford. Afterwards, Mace's massive army moved east to lay siege to the mighty castle-seat of the Baratheons, Storm's End. The Siege of Storm's End lasted the better part of a year, while Mace and his commanders feasted in sight of the starving garrison led by Robert's younger brother Stannis. Ultimately Stannis's determined defense held, and the siege only succeeded in pinning down Mace's army and preventing it from assisting the Targaryens in the climactic battles occurring further north. After the Sack of King's Landing, Eddard Stark rode south with the main rebel army to relieve the siege. With the capital city in rebel hands, and both Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and his father Mad King Aerys dead, Mace saw that the war was clearly lost and gave no battle to Lord Eddard. Instead he peacefully dipped his banners and submitted to Robert's rule, and in return was treated leniently, pardoned, and allowed to continue ruling the Reach as his family had before the war. However, ever since there was never any great love between Mace Tyrell and Stannis Baratheon.[5][6]
            Ser Loras tells Renly that his father would support Renly's claim to the Iron Throne. Renly rejects the notion, pointing out he is fourth in line to the throne, but Loras explains that he could fight for Renly and his father would bankroll their armies. Renly seems more intrigued by the notion[7] and later accepts the plan, though he fails to win the support of Lord Eddard Stark.[8] Along with Loras, Renly flees the city of King's Landing and heads south towards the Tyrell homelands.[9] It is later reported that Renly has been crowned king, with the full support of Lord Mace Tyrell and his forces.[10]
            Davos Seaworth mentions to Stannis Baratheon that Lord Mace is amongst the many lords that have declared for Renly Baratheon.[11]
            After Renly's death, the Tyrells enter into a new alliance with King Joffrey and House Lannister, instead of siding with Renly's brother Stannis, who is correctly suspected of having something to do with Renly's death.[12]
            Lord Mace is mentioned by his mother, Lady Olenna Tyrell, in conversation with Sansa Stark. She describes him as "a ponderous oaf" who rushed into a treasonous alliance with Renly and a dangerous one with the Lannisters just to see his daughter become queen.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mace_Tyrell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMaceTyrell</string></dict>

            Ronnel was the son of Jasper Arryn, the Head of House Arryn and the Lord of the Eyrie. He had two older siblings: Jon and Alys.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ronnel's family was unchanged.

        <key>Torrhen Karstark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.28.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Torrhen is a son of Lord Rickard Karstark, the Lord of Karhold. He has an older brotherÂ Harrion Karstark, who dies fighting in the War of the Five Kings.[1]
            The army led by Robb Stark against the forces of House Lannister is camped in the Westerlands. Torrhen Karstark is assigned to guard the prison cell of Ser Jaime Lannister and Ser Alton Lannister. Jaime Lannister has been held since his capture in the Battle of the Whispering Wood, while Alton Lannister has just returned from King's Landing with the crown's peace terms. As the other cells are full, Alton Lannister is put in the cell with his distant cousin. Their cell is guarded by Torrhen Karstark.
            Ser Jaime kills his cousin to create a distraction. When Torrhen Karstark enters the cell to check on the two, he sees both prisoners bloody with Jaime collapsed against the post he is chained to and Alton Lannister convulsing on the ground. As he leans over the body, Jaime is able to approach Torrhen from behind and strangle him with his shackles. After killing Torrhen, Jaime takes the keys off his belt and frees himself.[2]
            However, Jaime does not get very far (due to being fatigued from his imprisonment), and he is soon recaptured. Lord Rickard demands the head of the Kingslayer in revenge for the loss of his son. Catelyn is only barely able to get him to agree to wait for King Robb to return to decide the issue, but the Karstark forces grow restless as the night progresses. Fearing that the Karstarks will kill their valuable political hostage before dawn even arrives, Catelyn frees Jaime to trade him for the return of her daughters (as soon as Jaime reaches King's Landing). The anger of Lord Rickard and his need of a father's revenge sows dissension in Robb's army.[3]
            Lord Rickard attempts to justify his killing of Willem and Martyn Lannister as vengeance for the deaths of Harrion and Torrhen although Robb Stark does not accept his rationale and executes him for murder.[4]
            Later, an imprisoned Theon Greyjoy is at the mercy of an unknown boy (Ramsay Snow) who threatens to flay Theon's pinky if he cannot guess their current location, the boy's identity, and why he is torturing Theon. At first, the boy rather convincingly gives Theon the impression that he guessed right about them being in Karhold and that the boy is Torrhen's younger brother, angry over his death at the hands of the Kingslayer. But then the boy quickly crushes Theon's relief by revealing all of that was a lie and flays Theon's pinky anyway.[5]
            Although Torrhen is never again mentioned by name, his death is alluded to when Jaime argues with his sister-lover Cersei that he murdered people (alluding to Alton Lannister as well) to get back to her but she coldly replies, "You took too long."[6]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Torrhen Karstark is the third son of Lord Rickard, and also joins his father and brothers, Harrion, the eldest, and Eddard, the second, as part of the Northern forces in the War of the Five Kings. He is named after Torrhen Stark, the King in the North at the time of the War of Conquest.
            However, he is killed by Jaime during the Battle of the Whispering Wood. He serves alongside his brother Eddard as part of Robb Stark's personal bodyguard. When Jaime realizes that his army is lost during the Battle of the Whispering Wood, he makes a final push to single-handedly carve his way through the Northern army in an attempt to kill Robb Stark in single combat. Jaime manages to reach Robb's personal bodyguard and kill several of them, among them Torrhen and Eddard Karstark,Â before he is knocked unconscious.
            The TV series's depiction of an escape attempt by Jaime, during which he kills Torrhen Karstark, is a very loose adaptation of events in the books. Originally, Jaime was kept in relatively comfortable imprisonment, but then killed two guards and seriously injured a third during a failed escape attempt, after which he was chained up in the dungeon. Torrhen Karstark, however, was not one of these guards.
            In the TV version, Jaime kills Torrhen because he was guarding his cell, which causes Lord Rickard Karstark to become enraged and demand revenge, to the point that Catelyn releases Jaime (in promise of her daughters' safe return from King's Landing) because she fears he won't live out the night. In the books, Jaime killed Rickard's sons Torrhen and Eddard Karstark at the Battle of the Whispering Wood (Eddard Karstark's death is apparently unchanged in the TV version). While Lord Karstark was certainly upset in the books, he wasn't going to disobey Robb's direct command as his liege-lord that Jaime must remain unharmed (at least because he thought they'd execute him eventually). Catelyn's decision to exchange Jaime as a prisoner isn't rushed by pressure from within the Stark camp, but is rather due to her grief at hearing the (false) report that Bran and Rickon have been killed by Theon at Winterfell. Believing (somewhat justifiably) that even holding Jaime as prisoner is no guarantee that the crazed Joffrey won't have her daughters killed on a whim, Catelyn decides that keeping her remaining children safe is what matters most, so she releases Jaime, sending him under escort by Brienne to King's Landing. Rickard Karstark only truly becomes enraged after Catelyn releases Jaime, because he never thought they'd release the killer of his sons, as well as because it is a very poor exchange to trade a prominent Lannister warrior for two girls. The TV series may have moved Torrhen's death around to make it closer to Jaime's release, instead of just mentioning that Jaime killed Torrhen at the end of Season 1 and expecting the audience to remember this over a season later.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Torrhen_Karstark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTorrhenKarstark</string></dict>
        <key>Walder Frey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.29.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Walder Frey was the Lord of the Crossing, Lord of Riverrun, Lord Paramount of the Trident, and the head of House Frey, the Great House of the Riverlands, and a former vassal house to House Tully, the previous Great House which he betrayed at the Red Wedding. He was eventually murdered by Arya Stark in retaliation for the Red Wedding, where he had also betrayed House Stark.
            Walder Frey is the Lord of the Crossing and the head of House Frey, a vassal family of House Tully of the Riverlands. His house is noted for its overwhelming fertility and he has over one hundred descendants. He rules The Twins and its surrounding lands, controlling the strategically important crossing of the Green Fork. Over the years, this great stone bridge and the castles that control it have made House Frey a fortune in crossing fees. Lord Walder been married seven times and is almost ninety years old when the series begins.[2][3]
            He is referred to by his liege lord, Hoster Tully, as the "Late Lord Frey" after delaying his arrival to assist Robert's Rebellion until the outcome had already been determined.[4]
            Catelyn Stark meets a knight with a group of men at arms of House Frey at the Crossroads Inn and asks after Lord Walder's health. The knight replies that Lord Walder is well and is planning to celebrate his 90th birthday by taking a new wife. Tyrion Lannister laughs derisively at the news, making enemies of this group.[5]
            WhenÂ Robb Stark's army arrives at the Twins on its march south, Robb needs to cross the river to gain a tactical advantage over the Lannister forces. As a Tully bannerman, Walder Frey had been called up, but he had delayed going until he saw which side had the advantage. Now that Riverrun is besieged by the Lannisters, Frey wonders why he should risk their fury. Catelyn tells Robb that Walder Frey is slippery and not to be trusted, despite his allegiance to her father. Fearing that Walder would attempt to imprison Robb and sell him to the Lannisters, Catelyn volunteers to negotiate with him.[4]
            Upon entering the Twins, Catelyn finds Walder and his vast brood of sons, grandsons and bastards. Although two of his sons, Stevron and Ryger, respectfully remind their father to remember his courtesies to Catelyn, her being the daughter of their liege lord, Walder agrees to Catelyn's request to dismiss them - including his new fifteen-year-old wife, Joyeuse Erenford - while they negotiate. An alliance is formed; in return for permission to cross and the service of Walder's troops, Robb will marry one of Walder's daughters or granddaughters, whichever he likes. Additionally Arya, when recovered, will marry Walder's son Waldron. Robb must also take another son, Olyvar Frey, as a squire. Robb consents to the match, even after his mother indicates that Walder's daughters are not particularly attractive.[4]
            In response to Robb's plea for men to help him capture Casterly Rock, Lord Walder sends his sons Lothar and Black Walder to Riverrun to discuss the terms of a new alliance with him. Lord Walder demands Harrenhal, as well as the marriage between Edmure Tully and his daughter Roslin.[6]
            When the King in the North and his entourage arrive, Lord Walder offers them his hospitality, but cannot keep himself from mocking Robb over his broken oath, insulting Queen Talisa and leering over her. Later, he oversees the wedding of Edmure and Roslin, and the following feast. Once the newlyweds retire for the bedding, he has the halls sealed and gives the cue for his men to slaughter the Starks. He watches in rapture and takes sips from his cup as Talisa and Robb's bannermenÂ are killed. In a desperate bid to save her son, Catelyn Stark takes Lady Joyeuse hostage and begs Walder to spare his life, swearing they will take no vengeance. However, Walder hypocritically faults Catelyn for allowing her son to break the oath she swore to him the last time they spoke right there in his castle, even though he had then openly expressed his indifference towards the oath he swore to her father and had now just broken his promised protection of guest right. When Catelyn threatens to cut his wife's throat if he does not comply, Walder shrugs and coldly retorts that he will find another. Robb is then killed by Roose Bolton, who had sealed an alliance with Walder by marrying his granddaughter Walda, Lady Joyeuse is killed by Catelyn, and finally Catelyn is killed by Black Walder.[7]
            For his part in the Red Wedding, Lord Walder is granted Riverrun and protection from vengeful Northerners by Tywin Lannister. The next morning, he and Roose Bolton gloat over their victory, though Bolton appears concerned when it is discovered that Robb's great-uncle, Brynden Tully, escaped the massacre, while Frey is undisturbed. Frey voices his contempt for Robb, referring to him as a "stupid boy" and mockingly drinking a toast to him, while Bolton claims that it was precisely Robb's political inexperience that led him to betray him.[8]
            Lord Walder and the rest of House Frey are now the focus of distaste and hatred by the North and the Riverlands for their part in the Red Wedding, especially since the Riverlands have fallen into disarray and lawlessness since they were granted to the Freys by the Lannisters. None of House Tully's vassals accept Lord Walder as their new liege lord. A farmer avows that Lord Walder himself committed sacrilege by sharing bread and salt with the Starks and Tullys before slaughtering them, and that he will "burn in the seventh Hell" for it.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Walder_Frey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWalderFrey</string></dict>

        <key>Harrag</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.31.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Harrag is an Ironborn raider. He is a loyalist to Yara Greyjoy and opponent of Euron Greyjoy when the latter takes the Salt Throne, and a captain in Yara's fleet.
            Harrag's ship is one of the few to survive the assault on the Targaryen Fleet by Euron Greyjoy's Iron Fleet. Harrag and his crew find Theon Greyjoy, Yara's younger brother, in the sea while en route to Dragonstone and holster him up onto their ship. Harrag asks Theon if his sister is dead, to which he replies that Euron has her. Theon claims to have attempted to rescue Yara, but Harrag doubts it, replying that he wouldn't be alive if he had tried.[1]
            Harrag's ship travels back to Dragonstone, and he accompanies Theon's shore party to the island, where they findÂ Jon SnowÂ and a group of Daenerys' advisors. Theon reports on the attack on his fleet and capture of his sister, though his explanation leaves Harrag looking unsatisfied.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R.R. Martin, the only character named Harrag during the events of the narrative is Harrag Sharp, also known as Harrag Sheepstealer, an ironborn raider from House Sharp that took part in the capture of Winterfell by Theon Greyjoy and was later killed by Bolton men during the sack of the castle.
            "Harrag" is a somewhat common ironborn name, dating back at least to Harrag Hoare, a High King of the Iron Islands chosen at kingsmoot who reigned during the reign of King Theon Stark. He conquered Stony Shore and Bear Island, but only temporarily, before Theon Stark killed his son Ravos and expelled the ironborn from his shores.

        <key>Harren Hoare</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.32.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Harren Hoare, better known as Harren the Black and Black Harren, was an ironborn King who ruled over the Iron Islands and the Riverlands from his castle, Harrenhal.
            Harren the Black was an ironborn King who ruled over the Iron Islands and the Riverlands from his castle, Harrenhal. Harrenhal was the biggest castle in the entire history of the Seven Kingdoms and was built to be invulnerable to any attack by land.[1]
            However, when Aegon Targaryen invaded the Seven Kingdoms, King Harren's vassals from the Riverlands, led by Edmyn Tully, revolted against him, while Aegon the Conqueror unleashed his dragon, Balerion the Black Dread against the massive stronghold.[2] The King of the Iron Isles and the Riverlands and his sons perished as dragonflame consumed Harrenhal, leaving behind blackened and melted ruins.[3] With his armies destroyed, he was replaced with House Greyjoy.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Harren the Black was the last King of the Iron Islands and the Riverlands, grandson of Harwyn Hardhand, a King of the Iron Islands who took the Trident from Arrec, the Storm King (grandfather of Argilac the Arrogant). Harren's father extended their domains further east by conquering even more territory from the Kingdom of the Stormlands, advancing east from the Gods Eye to the Narrow Sea and south to the Blackwater Rush (more or less the area of the later Crownlands).
            Harren the Black was a vain, bloody tyrant hated by his vassals. His cruelty became legendary across Westeros. Harren had a very long reign: he had been king for forty years by the time of the War of Conquest. Argilac Durrandon was a strong king and managed to stem the tide of ironborn expansion, starting when he became king 20-30 years before the War of Conquest. Even so, Harren focused on strengthening his hold on the large territories that House Hoare already held, pouring massive resources into finishing Harrenhal (breaking the backs of thousands of enthralled Rivermen).
            Harren's growing strength and expansionist mindset indirectly led to the War of Conquest, or at least its immediate cause. After so many years Argilac was starting to grow old, and with only one daughter as an heir, he feared that Harren would sense weakness and mount another major invasion against the Stormlands. Argilac therefore proposed a marriage-alliance to Aegon Targaryen, whose dragons could stop Harren. Aegon declined the offer, however, pointing that he already had two wives - and that the vast lands that Argilac promised as dowry (from Gods Eye to the Blackwater) were in fact still held by Harren (and Aegon would only gain them if they succeeded). Aegon did give a counter-offer, that Argilac's daughter could marry his best friend (and rumored bastard brother) Orys Baratheon. Argilac was incensed at giving his daughter's hand in marriage to a bastard, so he cut off the hands of Aegon's envoy and mailed them back to Dragonstone in a box, saying they were the only hands he would ever receive from him. Aegon responded by calling his bannermen, and announcing that he intended to conquer not merely the Stormlands or the ironborn, but all of the Seven Kingdoms.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Harren_Hoare</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHarrenHoare</string></dict>

            Black Walder and Lothar Frey are sent to Riverrun by Lord Walder FreyÂ to negotiate with Robb Stark the terms for the Freys' re-entry into the Northern army. Black Walder bluntly demands that Harrenhal and all its attended lands to be inherited by House Frey for Robb Stark's "betrayal" in breaking his oath. Black Walder further demands that Edmure Tully be engaged to one of Lord Walder Freys's daughters, with the pair to be married within the fortnight due to the fact that Lord Walder had become wary of long engagements after his recent experience with Robb Stark. Before taking their leave, the pair demanded a response to their terms before they departed for The Twins the following morning.Â [1]
            During the aftermath of the Red Wedding, Catelyn Stark murders Walder Frey's wife by cutting her throat in grief of Robb's death after Roose Bolton stabs him through the heart with a dagger. Catelyn lets out a wail of tears and remains silent for a moment, before Black Walder steps behind her and cuts her throat and walks away as the blood spews out of her. [2]
            Black Walder and Lothar inform their father of the capture of Riverrun by Ser Brynden Tully. When Lord Walder berates them for allowing the Blackfish to escape in the first place, Black Walder begins to protest but his father cuts him off and demands they take back Riverrun. They argue that, since House Mallister and House Blackwood are supporting Brynden, and Riverrun is built to withstand sieges, retaking the castle would be impossible. Walder tells his bastard to take Riverrun by showing Brynden the knife he used to cut Catelyn's throat, and by using the captive Edmure as a bartering piece.[3]
            Black Walder and Lothar siege Riverrun as commanded, but do a poor job of it. They do not fortify their boundaries, allow the Lannister army to enter unnoticed, and do not even dig trenches. To try and force Brynden to surrender, Walder stands on a scaffold with Edmure and threatens to hang him. When this fails, he threatens to cut his throat as he did to Catelyn. Brynden calls his bluff, knowing that Edmure is too valuable to kill, and the siege continues. Ser Jaime Lannister arrives to take over from the Freys, but is immediately challenged by Walder. Jaime contemptfully calls Walder a fool for making threats he wasn't prepared to carry out and orders him to be silent. When Rivers keeps talking,Â Jaime hits him, and Walder begrudgingly follows his and Bronn'sÂ orders, although he is clearly unhappy.[4]
            Black Walder is later seen at The Twins, where the Lannisters and the Freys celebrate their successful siege of Riverrun. He is later killed by Arya Stark, who minces his flesh and bakes him into a pie together with his brother, Lothar. She then servesÂ the pie to their father, who eats at least one helping before Arya brings another and reveals what she had done, commenting that they were not easy to carve, especially Black Walder. Arya then reveals her identity to Lord Walder and slits his throat as Black Walder once did to her mother.[5]
            Lothar and Black Walder's remaining male family members are poisoned by Arya, who hosts a banquet using the face of their father.[6]
            When asked byÂ Hot PieÂ if she has made any pies recently, Arya repsonds with "a few", referring to the deaths of Lothar and Black Walder.[7]
            "Black Walder Rivers" in the TV series is a composite of two different Frey characters from the A Song of Ice and Fire novels: "Black" Walder Frey, Lord Walder's great-grandson and grandson of Stevron Frey, and Ser Walder Rivers, Lord Walder's eldest and most prominent bastard son, known as "Bastard Walder" for obvious reasons. The character who appeared in the TV series was named as "Black Walder" in Season 3, though the HBO Viewer's Guide referred to him as a bastard son, not a trueborn great-grandson. The updated Season 4 Viewer's Guide website clarified this by identifying him as "Black Walder Rivers".
            Black Walder's father, Ryman, is the eldest son of Ser Stevron Frey, who is himself the eldest son, and heir, of Lord Walder Frey. Thus Ryman's three sons - Edwyn, Black Walder, and Petyr - are the presumptive future heirs of House Frey (which includes over a hundred direct descendants of Lord Walder). At the beginning of the first novel, Black Walder is fourth in line to succeed Lord Walder, behind his grandfather Stevron, his father Ryman, and his older brother Edwyn. While Edwyn is ahead of Black Walder in the line of succession, he is not a fierce warrior like Black Walder is, and the two of them are constantly jockeying for power and favor within the family. As a result, Black Walder is one of the more prominent members of House Frey.
            Black Walder is a stern and wiry man with a black beard, who inspires terror in those around him. Black Walder is known to be resolute and easy to anger, being feared by many among his own family. He is rumored to have maintained numerous affairs with several women, including cousins and the wives of his close relations, even his full brothers' wives. In particular, it is strongly rumored that Black Walder had an affair with Lord Walder's seventh wife, Annara Farring, and that he is the true father of all six of her children (including Shirei Frey, allegedly Lord Walder's youngest daughter).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Walder_Rivers</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWalderRivers</string></dict>

            Rodrik was the oldest son of Balon Greyjoy and Alannys Harlaw. Balon is the head of House Greyjoy, the Lord Reaper of Pyke and the Lord of the Iron Islands. After his father crowned himself King of the Iron Islands and rebelled against the Iron Throne,Â Rodrik was killed fighting for his father in Seagard. Balon blamed Eddard Stark for his son's death.[1][2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Rodrik led a raid on the coastal castle Seagard during the Greyjoy Rebellion. He was killed by Lord Jason Mallister beneath the walls of Seagard.
            In "A Clash of Kings" and "A Dance with Dragons" it is revealed that Rodrik and Maron used to bully Theon. Even after so many years, Theon still remembers the beating and cruel japes he suffered from them.

After the death of his king in the Field of Fire, Harlen surrendered Highgarden to Aegon the Conqueror. Afterward, Aegon elevated Harlen to Lord Paramount of the Reach and Warden of the South and House Tyrell to the status of a Great House.[1][2]
            According toÂ Olenna Tyrell, Harlen was like most Tyrell men and grew up banging steel too loudly for thought to penetrate, like his descendants Luthor, Mace, and Loras.Â She also implies that it was Harlen's wife who came up with the idea to surrender to Aegon and convinced Harlen to go along with it.[3]

        <key>Shagga</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.36.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shagga is the leader of the Stone Crows and a fierce and independent warrior. He formed an alliance with Tyrion Lannister.
            Shagga, son of Dolf, is the leader of the Stone Crows, one of the hill tribes who live in the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon on the western border of the Vale of Arryn. He is a notable warrior who holds fealty to no lord.
            Shagga leads the party of tribesmen which finds Tyrion Lannister and Bronn traveling out of the Vale into the Riverlands. Shagga intends to rob the travellers and take Tyrion captive as a fool. Tyrion offers an alliance between the hill tribes and House Lannister on the basis that they share mutual enemies, House Arryn and House Stark, promising gold and weapons. Shagga agrees to the alliance and escorts Tyrion to the Lannister army camped in the Riverlands. The force is led by Tyrion's father, Lord Tywin Lannister. They are joined by Timett of the Burned Men and Chella of the Black Ears along the way. There are also clansmen from the Moon Brothers and Painted Dogs in their group. Tywin accepts the alliance and Shagga's insistence that they fight alongside Tyrion on the battlefield.[1]
            Tyrion reports to his father and his uncle that while at camp, a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage, at which the Moon Brother was set upon by three Stone Crows who opened his throat. Bronn managed to restrain Shagga from cutting off the dead man's genitals - "which was fortunate" - but Ulf of the Moon Brothers demanded blood money from the Stone Crows, which Shagga and Gunthor refused to pay. Tywin criticized Tyrion for the lack of discipline in these new allies he had brought to their side.[2]
            Shagga demands two axes from the Lannister stores to Kevan Lannister's chagrin. He and his men actually fight well at the Battle of the Green Fork and win a convincing victory over their foes. Tyrion fails to join them after he is accidentally knocked unconscious by his own men in the rush to the fight. Shagga and his troops join in the post-battle looting of the fallen bodies.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Shagga, son of Dolf, is a member of the Stone Crows, one of the mountain clans. He is a strong, large man who prefers to wield two weapons in combat. His favored taunt is to threaten to remove someone's manhood and feed it to "the goats" -even when there are no goats in the vicinity. He is not the most intelligent man, but is extremely dangerous in battle.
            When Tyrion and Bronn are on their way leaving theÂ ValeÂ for theÂ Lannister camp, Bronn captures a goat for food, and then they are met by the Stone Crows clan includingÂ Gunthor son of GurnÂ and Shagga, who claim the goat to be theirs - as Shagga claims, "our mountain, our goat." And then Tyrion persuades them into joining him as depicted in the TV series.
            During the Battle of the Blackwater, Tyrion recognized that the hill tribes, while ferocious, are inexperienced at siege-warfare, so he sent them south across the river to the Kingswood to harass the scouts of Stannis Baratheon's army as they approached the city. They performed quite well, destroying Stannis's scouts and screening forces to such an extent that he had no warning of the approach ofÂ TywinÂ LannisterâsÂ massive reinforcements approaching the city.
            After the battle Tywin pays off the hill tribes and most return home to the Mountains of the Moon in the Vale. Shagga and the Stone Crows, however, decide to stay in the Kingswood, feeling that there are better opportunities for them there.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Shagga</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascShagga</string></dict>

Tyrion and Bronn debate how to correctly pronounce his name, but VarysÂ offhandedly reveals the proper form: "sh(uh)-VY-al-thun".[1]
            Archmaester Ebrose hands his book All History of the House of Lannister to Samwell Tarly, claiming that it might be useful when writing A Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert I.[2]

        <key>Jaqen H'ghar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.38.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"Jaqen H'ghar" is a mysterious man - introducing himself as a Lorathi criminal - who was arrested and put in the dungeons of King's Landing, before being recruited by Yoren to join the Night's Watch. He is in Yoren's party as the latter smuggles Arya Stark out of King's Landing. He travels with them to the lands south of Harrenhal, where they are captured by Lannister forces.
            In reality, "Jaqen H'ghar" is just an assumed identity of one of the Faceless Men of Braavos, a feared order of mysterious assassins with the ability to change their appearance at will. After the Jaqen persona is of no more use to him, the Faceless Man shapeshifts into a new appearance and tells Arya he will train her to be a Faceless Man if she goes with him. Eventually, Arya travels to Braavos to look for Jaqen and finds him, and he trains her. Her training is complete upon killing the Waif and he fully deems her to be "no one".
            Jaqen is surprisingly calm in the face of danger, yet courteous. Hailing from Lorath he uses identity-less speech patterns in which he refers to people using the third person indefinite, e.g., saying "a man thanks a girl" when he is directly addressing Arya and expressing his own thanks.
            Jaqen is a criminal from the Free Cities, arrested by the City Watch and thrown into the dungeons of the Red Keep in King's Landing. When looking for fresh recruits for the Night's Watch, Yoren was given permission by Lord Eddard Stark, Hand of the King to go through the dungeons and take any criminals who would swear to take the black. He chose H'ghar as a potential candidate, as well as two other murderers Biter and Rorge from the black cells, where the worst criminals are kept.
            Jaqen H'ghar is in the party led by Yoren that leaves King's Landing for the Wall, along with Hot Pie, Lommy Greenhands,Â Gendry, and Arya Stark who is being smuggled out to be returned to Winterfell. Because Yoren is traveling so far with so few men, the worst three are kept in a locked barred cell on the back of a wagon.[1]
            Jaqen calls over "Arry" (who is actually Arya Stark). He asks her to fill a tankard with water and tells her that he has not drunk for a day and a night, always referring to himself as âa manâ and her as âa boyâ. Rorge, one of the other prisoners, rattles the cage and threatens Arya. Jaqen asks Arya for forgiveness and tells her that he has not chosen his companions. He confirms her identity as Arry and introduces himself, saying that he comes from Lorath. Rorge demands beer and insults Arya. She says that he should have asked nicely, drops all but one of her sticks and uses it to hit his hand. He recoils and then tries to grab her through the cage. Biter moves up behind Rorge and hisses as Rorge threatens Arya again. Jaqen smiles and tells Arya that she has more courage than sense as she backs away.[2]
            The group is resting in a barn when they are roused to arms by Yoren and told they are being attacked. As they rush outside one man trips and drops his torch, setting a fire near the prisoner wagon. They are met by Ser Amory Lorch and a force of men loyal to House Lannister. Lorch points out the Gold Cloaks with him and says that they have come for Gendry, a royal bastard. Lorch orders Yoren and the recruits to drop their weapons. Yoren remains defiant and Lorch orders him shot.[3]
            Seeing their leader killed, Gendry and many of the other recruits join the fight. Arya is distracted by Jaqen calling for help as the flames lick the bars of his cage. She hands him an axe before rushing to join the fray. Gendry is overwhelmed and knocked down. As Arya runs round a corner she is knocked over and taken prisoner along with the other survivors. Jaqen does not fight against the Lannister men, though he's surprised that Arya helped him.[3]
            The prisoners are taken to Harrenhal, one being picked each day by Ser Gregor Clegane to be tortured and killed under the supervision of a man called the Tickler. Lord Tywin Lannister arrives and ends the pointless brutality, choosing Arya as his cupbearer.[4] After being told to fetch water by Tywin Lannister, Arya meets Jaqen again; however, he is dressed in a Lannister uniform. She accuses him of being "one of them now", but he counters her, questioning for whom she is fetching water.
            Jaqen says he always knew she was a girl, but she was entitled to her secret. He then informs her of the debt he, Rorge, and Biter owe her. Because she saved three lives, she has taken three lives from the Red God. He says that they must be given back and that she is to name three people who will be killed to repay the debt. Arya names the torturer known as The Tickler. The Tickler is found dead in the courtyard, under the windows of a raised walkway. Arya goes to the body and looks up to see Jaqen staring down. He touches his cheek with one finger, indicating that the first death has been repaid.[5]
            Jaqen is approached by a panicked Arya, who desperately requests her second death: Ser Amory Lorch. He had become suspicious of her intent while ferreting Lannister documents. Jaqen bristles at her insistence on urgency. Arya explains the situation and he reluctantly obliges, assassinating Ser Amory with a dart dipped in wolfsbane to the neck seconds before he reaches Tywin Lannister.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jaqen_H%27ghar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJaqenH'ghar</string></dict>
        <key>Euron Greyjoy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.39.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Euron Greyjoy is the brother of Balon Greyjoy, the Lord Reaper of Pyke and later King of the Iron Islands, and Aeron Greyjoy, a Drowned Man. He is also the uncle to Balon's children, Rodrik, Maron, Yara, and Theon Greyjoy. After murdering his brother Balon, Euron takes control of the Salt Throne with the support of many Ironborn and seeks to hunt down Yara and Theon, who oppose Euron and have allied with Daenerys Targaryen.
            Euron is captain of the longship Silence, the flagship of the Iron Fleet, and wields a two-handed battleaxe in combat.[1]
            Euron's personal sigil is the standard Greyjoy heraldry of a kraken on black, but the kraken is silver instead of gold with a third red eye inscribed onto its head.
            Euron is named "Commander of the Lannister Fleet" - although he primarily uses the Iron Fleet as his main ships - after he defeats the allies of Daenerys in Blackwater Bay and delivers Ellaria and Tyene Sand, as a gift to Cersei.
            Euron Greyjoy is the younger brother of Balon Greyjoy, head of House Greyjoy, Lord Reaper of Pyke and Lord of the Iron Islands.[2]
            At the outset of the Greyjoy Rebellion when Balon first declared himself King of the Iron Islands, Euron orchestrated the daring Raid on Lannisport which burned Tywin Lannister's entire fleet at anchor. This gave the Ironborn command of the western seas and coasts of Westeros for a time.[3]
            Following the failure of the Greyjoy Rebellion, Euron went into exile, and has spent the last years as a pirate, reaving from Oldtown to Qarth and beyond, fighting Summer Islanders and the Ibbenese. He once lost his senses during a storm while sailing on the Jade Sea, and his crew was forced to tie him to the mast to prevent him from jumping overboard. When he was let down after the storm, he had all their tongues ripped out. Euron later glibly remarked of the incident that "I needed silence."[4]
            Tyrion Lannister tells Theon Greyjoy about his memories of witnessing the Raid on Lannisport which Tyrion says was caused by Theon's uncles.[5]
            Euron returns to the Iron Islands following the War of the Five Kings, arriving during a violent storm. He confronts Balon on a rope bridge between two of Pyke's towers, as it is buffeted by the wind and rain. Balon says he assumed Euron would be dead by now, rotting under some foreign sea. Euron sarcastically replies with the traditional Ironborn words, "what is dead may never die", and chides Balon when he doesn't repeat the phrase. Balon accuses him of mocking the Drowned God, which Euron retorts by boasting that he is the Drowned God: for from Oldtown to Qarth, whenever men see his sails they pray. The strong wind batters the bridge, making Balon have to hold onto the support ropes, but with eerie calmness Euron stands perfectly still with his hands together in front of him, unafraid. Smirking, Euron notes that his brother is old, and says it is time for him to move aside and let another rule.
            Balon draws closer, and says he heard that Euron lost his mind during a storm on the Jade Sea, and the crew had to tie him to the mast to stop him from jumping overboard. Euron smiles and matter-of-factually acknowledges, "They did." Balon goes on to mention that Euron "rewarded" his crew for saving him by cutting out their tongues, to which Euron replies, "I needed silence."
            Balon then accuses him by asking what kind of an ironborn loses his senses during a storm, to which Euron firmly says "I am the storm - the first storm, and the last" - and Balon is in his way. Realizing that Euron has come to kill him, Balon attacks him with a knife, slashing his left cheek, but Euron easily overpowers his elder brother, and throws him off the bridge to his death.[6]
            Following his nephew Theon's endorsement of his niece Yara, Euron arrives at the kingsmoot, announcing his name and his decision to claim the Salt Throne. At first, he greets Theon and Yara cordially, but then he begins to mock Theon for his failures and castration, which draws some laughs from the other ironborn. Euron reveals that he returned only a few days ago, leading Yara to realize that he murdered Balon. She accuses him of the murder, and he freely admits it in front of the other ironborn captains, claiming that Balon only ever led the ironborn into two wars they could not hope to win, and apologizes to the captains for not returning to kill him sooner, a sentiment which they nod and murmur at. Theon says that Yara should be queen because while Euron was "gallivanting" around the Known World, she was leading the ironborn and planning to return the Iron Islands to their former glory, by building the largest fleet the world has ever seen. Mocking Theon's vocabulary, Euron counters that in his travels, he has seen more of the world than the rest of the captains combined, and that he knows that Daenerys Targaryen, who owns three large dragons, hates the lords of Westeros as much as the ironborn, and has neither a husband nor ships. He intends to sail to Slaver's Bay, bring her back to Westeros as his wife, and conquer the Seven Kingdoms with their combined forces. The captains all declare for him when he announces that he paid the iron price for his crown.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Euron_Greyjoy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascEuronGreyjoy</string></dict>

            Ser Emmon is a knight of House Cuy, an ancient noble family of the Reach.
            King Renly Baratheon's camp is a hive of activity as his troops prepare for the coming battle with the forces of King Stannis Baratheon in darkness. The camp is beset by strong winds. Catelyn Stark meets with King Renly in his command tent. Ser Emmon and his sworn brother Ser Robar Royce are outside while Brienne of Tarth stands watch inside the tent. Hearing Brienne scream the guards rush into the tent with swords in hand. They see Brienne kneeling over Renlyâs corpse and assume that she is responsible. The two knights threaten her life. Catelyn tries to intervene but they push her aside. Brienne fights both of them off, killing them.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Emmon Cuy is a member of the Rainbow Guard as "Emmon the Yellow" and hails from House Cuy of Sunflower Hall, a noble house from the Reach. Unlike in the episode, he, Robar Royce, and two guards enter Renly's tent just after his King's assassination. Cuy blames Brienne for the death and attacks her. One of the guards tries to burn her using a flaming torch, but her cloak is too soaked with blood to burn. Brienne cuts the guard's hand, fights Cuy and the remaining guard, and apparently kills the latter. Catelyn Stark convinces Robar that Brienne is innocent and he fights off the men-at-arms that follow Cuy, while Catelyn uses an iron brazier to knock Emmon Cuy unconscious, then she and Brienne escape. Ser Emmon and Ser Robar are later killed by Lord Commander Ser Loras Tyrell in a fit of rage, because of their failure to protect King Renly and their allowing Brienne to escape. As he lay dying, Ser Emmon swears it was Brienne that killed Renly, and thus the rumors of this follow her.
            When Loras was convinced of Brienne's innocence, he was filled with deep remorse for killing Cuy and Royce.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Emmon_Cuy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascEmmonCuy</string></dict>
        <key>Anguy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.43.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Anguy is a skilled archer hailing from the Stormlands and a member of the Brotherhood Without Banners.
            Anguy is among the company of Thoros of Myr when they come across Arya Stark, Gendry and Hot Pie. He coerces an unwilling Hot Pie into following them to a nearby inn by making an impressive trick-shot. Later on, he presents a captured Sandor Clegane to his companions and is met with a roar of approval, and is present when Sandor reveals Arya's identity.[1]
            After bringing his captive before Beric Dondarrion, he voices his disgust over the atrocities committed by the Lannister forces at the Mummer's Ford.[2]. Later he is present during the trial by combat which the Hound kills Lord Beric and is freed from his accusations.[3]
            Anguy teaches Arya how to shoot a bow properly, when confronted by Melisandre, who has come to claim Gendry for the Lord of Light. He does nothing to stop her, earning himself the wrath of Arya.[4]
            When Arya runs away from the Brotherhood, Anguy is sent to bring her back. He is unsuccessful when she is captured by the Hound instead and taken away.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Anguy is a superb archer from the Dornish Marches, the mountainous southern region of the Stormlands which borders Dorne. He won the archery competition during the Tourney of the Hand and was approached by Alyn, a guardsman on orders fromÂ Eddard StarkÂ to offer him a place on the Stark household guard, but Anguy drunkenly declined. Anguy is part of the Iron Throne host assembled by Eddard Stark to execute Ser Gregor Clegane and becomes one of the founders of the Brotherhood Without Banners after the Battle at the Mummer's Ford.
            Many characters who later formed the Brotherhood were introduced at the Tourney of the Hand in the first novel. This tourney did occur in Season 1 of the TV series, but the characters were not introduced, because they would not really make a significant appearance until Season 3 - they are given cameos in the first novel but only reappear as "the Brotherhood" in the third novel (though as in Season 2 of the TV series, in the second novel characters do mention that something called "the Brotherhood" is harassing Lannister supply lines).
            At the Tourney of the Hand, Anguy won the archery contest and Thoros of Myr won the melee contest. This is why they arrived in King's Landing, and were available when Ned Stark ordered Beric Dondarrion to lead out a group of able knights to bring Gregor Clegane to justice - the soldiers who formed the original core of the Brotherhood Without Banners. Thus the connection might be lost on the TV audience that one of the reasons the Brotherhood is such a disproportionately capable fighting force is because so many of its initial members were elite fighters who came to the capital city to participate in the Tourney of the Hand. For example it might a bit contrived in the TV series that, as if by pure chance, the Brotherood's lead archer Anguy just happens to be preternaturally skilled with a bow. The books actually do explain that he is a professional archer so skilled that he actively competes in tournaments, and indeed recently won first place at a royal-level archery tournament. Moreover, he doesn't just happen to be wandering in the Riverlands, but the rational reason was given that he was in the capital for a major tournament, before being sent out with Dondarrion.
            Following the Red Wedding, the Brotherhood has fallen low, its members are no different to regular outlaws. As a result, Anguy and many others have abandoned the Brotherhood.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Anguy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAnguy</string></dict>

        <key>Erryk Cargyll</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.47.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Erryk Cargyll was a renowned knight, and member of the Kingsguard who fought and died in the Dance of the Dragons, as well as the twin of Ser Arryk Cargyll.
            Ser Erryk was the twin brother of Ser Arryk Cargyll, who was also a member of the Kingsguard.
            Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk Cargyll are mentioned as being twin brothers who ended up on opposite sides of the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. The twin brothers supposedly met on the field of battle, and died at each others hand with tears on their cheeks.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Erryk Cargyll was also the twin brother of Ser Arryk, and both were knights of the Kingsguard.
            When Aegon II Targaryen usurped the throne ahead of his sister Rhaenyra, and was crowned king by Lord Commander Criston Cole himself, it split the realm and the Kingsguard itself: three other Kingsguard sided with Aegon II and Ser Criston, but three others fled to join Rhaenyra's Queensguard. Ser Arryk sided with Aegon II, while Ser Erryk sided with Rhaenyra.
            Eventually, Ser Arryk was sent to infiltrate Rhaenyra's base of power at Dragonstone castle, pretending to be his twin brother, but he happened to run into Erryk in a hallway. In the ensuing duel, each brother died at the point of the other's sword. In some ways it was a microcosm of the entire Dance of the Dragons: a destructive civil war that set brother against brother, and for which there was no winner but mutual destruction.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Erryk_Cargyll</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascErrykCargyll</string></dict>
        <key>Aeron Greyjoy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.48.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aeron Greyjoy, commonly referred to as Aeron Damphair, is a Drowned Man in service to the Drowned God, the deity worshiped by the Ironborn of the Iron Islands off the western coast of Westeros. He is the brother of Balon Greyjoy, the Lord Reaper of Pyke, and Euron Greyjoy, captain of the longship Silence, as well as the uncle of Balon's children, Yara and Theon Greyjoy.
            Aeron Greyjoy is the brother of Euron and Balon Greyjoy, the late head of House Greyjoy and the former Lord Reaper of Pyke. He is also the uncle of Yara and Theon Greyjoy. He is a Drowned Man in service to the Drowned God.[1]
            Aeron oversees the funeral of Balon Greyjoy after his assassination. When his niece Yara swears on the Salt Throne that she will avenge her father's murder, Aeron reminds her that the King of the Iron Islands must be chosen in the kingsmoot.[2]
            Aeron hosts the kingsmoot a few days later, but does not participate. After the ironborn choose Euron Greyjoy to be their new king, Aeron takes him into the sea to be drowned, reciting a prayer as he does so, to consecrate his faith to the Drowned God. Euron is taken ashore and revived, and Aeron places a driftwood crown on his head. He goes with Euron and the ironborn captains to seek out Theon and Yara, and is the first to point out that they have fled in the best ships on the Iron Islands.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aeron is known as Damphair and is a priest of the Drowned God. He is tall and thin with fierce black eyes and a beak of a nose. He garbs himself in roughspun robes dyed in the green, grey, and blue of the Drowned God. He never cuts his hair, which falls to his waist and he weaves seaweed into it.
            Of all his brothers, Aeron was especially close to Urrigon. One day, they played the "finger dance" (a common and quite dangerous game among the ironborn). The axe Aeron threw cut half of Urrigon's hand. Rather than heal Urrigon by the old way with fire and seawater, the maester who treated him tried to reattach the severed fingers, the wound became infected and Urri died as a result. Even though many years passed, Aeron still mourns Urrigon and blames himself for his death. He also does not trust maesters.
            When Aeron was young, Euron used to enter the bed chamber which he shared with Urrigon, and sexually molest one of them, at his choice. As a result,Â even after many years, Aeron sometimes has nightmares about a door with screeching iron hinges, which he associates with Euron.
            In his youth, Aeron was an unruly ribald drunk who often came at odds with his brother Balon. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, he nearly drowned when his ship was sunk by Stannis Baratheon. He washed ashore and was imprisoned at Lannisport. After being released (it is not mentioned how and when), he had changed significantly due to his near-death experience, and became very pious and devoted to the worship of the Drowned God.
            Aeron's devotion to the Drowned God became greatly respected, and in time he rose to command strong influence among the ironborn. Officially, the Drowned Men priests have no single leader or ruling hierarchy, but Aeron is universally considered to be their de facto leader.
            In the novel A Clash of Kings, when Theon returns to the PykeÂ from the North, it is Aeron who greets him first and almost immediately baptizes him at his arrival.
            Aeron makes his first appearance in the Season 6 episode "Home", which roughly corresponds with the Ironborn storyline in "A Feast for Crows". While Aeron's character is faithful to his portrayal in the novel, it does not mention that he presided over his brother Balon's funeral. He also does not meet his niece Asha at Balon's funeral since Asha first travels to meet her uncle Rodrik Harlaw at the Ten Towers in Harlaw island. Aeron only briefly meets with Asha during the Kingsmoot itself at Old Wyk. Like the novel, Aeron also appears to be hostile to Yara's aspirations to succeed her father as ruler of the Iron Islands, though he does not seem hostile towards Euron's claim.
            In A Feast of Crows, Aeron is given point-of-view chapters. Since Euron's return to the Iron Islands, Aeron is staunchly opposed to his brother seizing the Seastone Chair in the wake of Balon's death. He regards Euron as an ungodly man who has abandoned the Drowned God, and favors Victarion as Balon's rightful successor. Aeron does not care (like nearly all the ironborn) whether Theon is dead or alive. While Aeron in the TV series does not contest Euron's victory and even crowns him with the driftwood crown, the book Aeron is furious at Euron's election and plans to overthrow him.
            Aeron believes that Euron's sorcerers sent a spell among the ironborn, that made them vote for him. He tries to persuade Victarion to overthrow Euron, but Victarion refuses, since the habit of obedience is rooted deep in him. Aeron is not willing to give up: he says that he will go to the simple folk and turn them against Euron. He disappears the next day, his fate is unknown.
            In A Dance of Dragons, Aeron's Drowned Men claim that he is somewhere on the Iron Islands, preaching against the Crow's Eye and his rule in hope to raise the ironborn against him, and will soon come forth to call down the wrath of the Drowned God on Euron and his minions. Erik Ironmaker, whom Euron assigns to rule the Iron Islands in his absence, captures some of the Drowned Men and interrogates them about Aeron's whereabouts, but to no avail. Tristifer Botley believes Aeron is dead and the search for him is a ruse, to make the ironborn believe Aeron escaped, because Euron is afraid to be seen as a kinslayer. Asha claims (correctly) that Euron is capable of kinslaying.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aeron_Greyjoy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAeronGreyjoy</string></dict>
        <key>Aemon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.49.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Maester Aemon was the maester at Castle Black and one of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's closest advisers in the Night's Watch.
            He was born Aemon Targaryen and was the last known Targaryen in Westeros. He was the great-uncle of Daenerys Targaryen, and unknown to him, was the great-great uncle of Jon Snow. Aemon's origins have long been forgotten by most, as he remained dedicated to his vows as a Maester and a brother of the Night's Watch for many decades.
            Aemon was born into the royal House Targaryen, the second son of King Maekar I and Queen Dyanna. Originally known as Prince Aemon Targaryen, he was not his father's eldest son, so he eventually joined the order of Maesters. Aemon gave up all rights to inheritance when he took his vows, which also included relinquishing his surname "Targaryen".
            Aemon's older brother, Aerion, later died, however, and despite being a sworn maesterÂ there were those who felt that the crown should pass to him. Aemon refused the throne, however, and it passed to his younger brother, who became King Aegon V. Aemon then joined the Night's Watch to further remove himself from the political intrigues of the royal court and from those who wished to set him up as a rival against his brother.
            Many years later, Aegon V died in the Tragedy at Summerhall and the crown passed to his son, Aemon's nephew Aerys II, who later became known as "The Mad King". Aerys'sÂ growing insanity ultimately led to the outbreak of Robert's Rebellion, which saw House Targaryen deposed and practically exterminated. Upon hearing about the brutal deaths of his family in King's Landing during the rebellion, Aemon bore great sadness which never left him.[2]
            Around one hundred years old, Aemon is thought to be one of the oldest living men in Westeros, though he has retained all of his wits and his mind is still very sharp. He has served as the maester at Castle Black for many decades.[3]
            Aemon has long since gone blind due to old age. It is not clear when he went blind (he was not born blind), though he has stated that he was already old and blind during Robert's Rebellion.[2] As a man of learning, he laments not being able to read anymore, even though Castle Black ironically has an ancient and well-stocked library consisting of thousands of books.[4] Because one of a maester's basic duties is to handle messages sent to and from a castle by messenger-ravens, Aemon has to rely on the assistance of others to physically read the letters for him.[5]
            After Tyrion Lannister has arrived at Castle Black, Maester Aemon asks him to urge the Queen to send more men to the Night's Watch: there is a severe lack of men to defend the Wall. They discuss the coming winter, and Aemon assures Tyrion that the next winter will be long and terrible. Lord Commander Mormont is worried about rumors of White Walkers abroad north of the Wall. He sends Benjen Stark ranging to investigate.[6]
            When Jon Snow and the other new recruits are done with their first training, Maester Aemon gives the new stewards their assignments. Jon is to become Jeor Mormont's steward, which is a great disappointment to Jon: he had hoped to become a ranger. Samwell Tarly is assigned as Aemon's steward, to help physically read letters delivered by messenger-ravens to the blind old man. Aemon chides Jon that he swore a vow to serve the Watch in any capacity, then departs. Sam then reminds Jon that being a steward for the Lord Commander might mean that Jon is being groomed for a high command position in the Watch.[7] The bodies of two of the rangers who accompanied Benjen are found near the Godswood. The Lord Commander plans to have Aemon examine them, but they return as wights and have to be burned before he does so.[5]
            When Jon hears about his "father" Eddard Stark's imprisonment, he is torn between his loyalty to the Night's Watch and his love for his family. Maester Aemon intercepts Jon as he is preparing to desert the Watch. Aemon says he is aware of Jon's struggle and reveals his Targaryen heritage to him, recounting the deaths of his nephew Aerys II, Aerys's son Rhaegar, and Rhaegar's two young children; neither Aemon nor Jon are aware that Rhaegar and his children were Jon's true father and half-siblings.[8] He sat and waited on the Wall while he heard about his family being butchered during Robert's Rebellion and the few survivors fleeing into exile, and did nothing because having joined the Watch, his duty was with his brothers there and no longer with his House. Aemon explains that this was a difficult decision, yet he had to make it and that one must live with the consequences of one's choices for the rest of one's life.[2] Maester Aemon remains at Castle Black during the Lord Commander's great ranging.[9]
            Maester Aemon is still at Castle Black when Samwell Tarly returns with Gilly after escaping from Craster's Keep. Aemon at first advises Sam that he swore an oath when joining the Night's Watch, believing that Sam fathered Gilly's son.
            Samwell corrects him that he is not the father, but that the girl is one of Craster's daughter-wives, which engenders sympathy in Aemon. Because it is too dangerous beyond the Wall, Aemon relents and offers shelter to Gilly in Castle Black for the time being. Gilly thanks him and calls him "my lord", but Aemon insists that he gave up being a lord many years ago (when he joined the Order of Maesters and left House Targaryen). With the matter settled, Aemon commands Samwell to make sure all of the messenger-ravens are well-fed, and tells him to take a quill and parchment: he dictates to Samwell a request for help which will be sent to all the major lords throughout the Seven Kingdoms, imploring them for aid against the threat of the White Walkers.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aemon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAemon</string></dict>

        <key>The Tickler</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.52.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The Tickler was a soldier serving under Ser Gregor Clegane who specialized in interrogation and torture techniques.
            After Arya Stark, Gendry and Hot Pie are imprisoned at castle Harrenhal, which has been taken over by the Lannister army, they hear the Tickler interrogating a prisoner. The following day, another villager is selected by Gregor Clegane. The Tickler has the prisoner strapped and a bucket with a rat inside put over his chest. He interrogates the prisoner about hidden gold, jewels and the whereabouts of "The Brotherhood" and which villagers are helping them. When the prisoner denies knowledge, the Tickler has Weasel heat the bucket with fire to make the rat claw its way through the prisoner's chest. After a short time, the prisoner denounces a butcher named Gaines and his son, but the Tickler continues with the torture, killing the prisoner.[1]
            The next day, it is Gendry who is chosen and the Tickler goes through the same process again, but Gendry is saved when Tywin Lannister arrives and decides it's stupid to kill able-bodied workers.
            Jaqen H'ghar wants to repay Arya for saving his life, when he was trapped in the burning wagon. He offers Arya Stark three deaths as balance for his life and the lives of Rorge and Biter. She robbed theÂ Many-Faced GodÂ of three deaths and must name three to replace them. The torturer is the first man she names (she doesn't know his real name, just that they call him the Tickler). Arya is talking to Gendry when they hear a scream. They run out to see the Tickler dead on the ground, his neck broken. Above him on the walkway, Arya sees Jaqen H'gher. He places one finger up next to his cheek.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Tickler is an associate of Ser Gregor Clegane and serves in his band of man-at-arms alongside Polliver, Chiswyck, Raff "the Sweetling", Dunsen and others. His face is so ordinary and his garb so plain that Arya might have thought him one of the villagers before she had seen him at his work. His real name is not revealed.
            The torturing takes place during stops on the forced march to Harrenhal, not at Harrenhal itself. Sometimes Chiswyck assists the Tickler with the torturing, sometimes others of the Mountain's men. Every day the Tickler picks people at random from the captives (but not Gendry). He always asks them the same questions:
            None of the tortured captives survived the Tickler's interrogation. The strongest lasted past evenfall. Their bodies were hung beyond the fires for the wolves. The answers they gave were contradictory: that Beric had ten starvelings with him, or else a hundred mounted knights; that he had ridden west, or north, or south; that he had crossed the lake in a boat; that he was strong as an aurochs, or weak from the bloody flux, etc. - but the Tickler did not seem to care. The Tickler's great cruelty was that he knew that nearly all of the people he tortured were being honest when they said they had no more gold, and that they knew nothing about the Brotherhood, but he tortured them to death anyway simply because he could.
            Tywin Lannister does not come to Harrenhal while the Tickler is there (he is one of Gregor Clegane's men and Tywin Lannister doesn't come until later). Unlike his television counterpart, he is not killed by Jaqen H'ghar. The Tickler leaves Harrenhal and his story continues in the books.
            Arya and the Hound encounter the Tickler, accompanied by Polliver and a Sarsfield squire, at the Inn at the Crossroads. During the ensuing brawl Arya kills the Tickler by stabbing him repeatedly in the back. With every stab, Arya sarcastically screams the questions the Tickler used to ask his victims.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Tickler</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTheTickler</string></dict>

        <key>Eddison Tollett</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.54.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Eddison Tollett is a brother of the Night's Watch and close friends withÂ Jon Snow, Samwell Tarly, Grenn, and Pypar. He took command of the Wall during the Battle of Castle Black when Jon went down to reinforce the southern gate, and accompanied Jon to Hardhome. After Jon Snow was resurrected by Melisandre, Jon sees to the execution of the men responsible for his own murder at the Mutiny at Castle Black. After the traitors had been executed, Jon hands his cloak to Edd. As Jon's final command, he unofficially names Edd the actingÂ Lord Commander of the Night's Watch before departing Castle Black and leaving the Night's Watch behind.
            Edd, also called Dolorous Edd, is a member of the Night's Watch. Edd swore his oath when he was fifteen. His nickname is due to his sarcastic and pessimistic sense of humor.
            Edd joins the Great Ranging beyond the Wall led by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. As the Night's Watch arrives to Craster's Keep in the Haunted Forest, Edd watches Samwell Tarly and Grenn bickering. Edd approaches Jon Snow, who observes the fortified homestead, and deadpans that he was born in a similar place but that he has now fallen on hard times. Sam, and later Grenn, join the pair and note the women working around the hall. Edd warns not to speak to them. Grenn wonders if Craster, the master of the hall, doesn't like people speaking to his daughters. Edd answers that they are also his wives because Craster marries his daughters and breeds more daughters with them. Sam and Grenn state their disgust and Edd counters that while all the other wildlings in the area have disappeared, Craster is still present, so he must be doing something right.[1]
            Sam, Edd, and Grenn are peeling potatoes outside Craster's Keep. Edd says that if the gods wanted people to have dignity they would not have made them fart when they died. Grenn is incredulous, and Edd tells him the story of his mother's death. He claims that he held her hand as she passed and that she farted long and hard, then making a farting noise to underscore his assertion. Sam notices Gilly, and observes that it is greedy for Craster to have so many wives. Edd deadpans that they were having a serious discussion. Grenn and Sam and continue their conversation, with Grenn telling Sam of his relationship with a girl named Violet. Edd interrupts again and sends Sam for more vegetables.[2]
            Having left Craster's Keep and the Haunted Forest, the Ranging approaches the Fist of the First Men to meet with Qhorin Halfhand. Edd hears Sam commenting on the beauty of the place and that Gilly would love it there. Edd comments to Grenn that there is nothing more sickening than a man in love.[3]
            The Watch reach the summit of the Fist and set up camp. Edd begs Sam to shut up as he comments on the history of the ancient place. After Sam wonders what the First Men were like, Edd answers they must have been stupid, as smart people wouldn't find themselves in places like the Fist. Jon suggests that their distant ancestors were afraid and came to the Fist to escape something but doesn't believe that it worked.[3]
            A horn sounds, causing all men to stop their activities. Jon watches a column of men approaching before saying that a single blast is for rangers returning while two blasts are for wildlings. Edd notes the moment after one blast, standing and waiting, wondering if a second blast will come and repeats that one blast is for friends and two for foes. Sam adds that three blasts are used to signal White Walkers. Jon, Grenn, and Edd turns to look at him and he explains that it has been a thousand years since it was done. Grenn asks how Sam knows if so much time has passed. Edd and Grenn interrupt and, sarcastically, finish Sam's answer before he can say he read it in a book. Grenn walks away while Edd stops when Jon announces it's the Halfhand approaching. Edd says that they will live another day, punctuating his monotone with a sarcastic "hurrah".[3]
            Edd is close to Jon as Qhorin confirms to Lord Commander Mormont that Mance Rayder has gathered a massive host and reports lookouts in the Skirling Pass. He takes a small party of scouts ahead to surprise the lookouts; Jon is among them.[3]
            Some time later, Edd, Grenn, and Sam talk while digging latrines and discuss the possibility that Jon, the Halfhand, and the others rangers might be dead. Grenn discovers a stone tablet marked with runes of the First Men. Edd keeps digging and tells him to leave it alone but he lifts it anyway. Beneath it is a cache of weapons, mostly spearheads, as well a horn, all wrapped in a Night's Watch cloak. Sam identifies them as being made of dragonglass.[4]
            Nearby the base of the Fist, Edd gathers frozen feces to burn for fire alongside Grenn and Sam. He's annoyed when Sam begins to talk about Gilly and snarks that Sam finds her interesting just because she spoke to him. Sam counters that what he finds interesting about Edd is absolutely nothing. Their banter is interrupted by a horn blast. Sam wonders if the Halfhand has returned and a second horn blast is heard. Grenn draws his sword and Edd tells them to return to the Fist so as not to fight the wildlings alone. A third blast sounds, prompting Edd to scream at his sworn brothers to run. Grenn and Edd quickly make it back to the Fist, seemingly not noticing they have left Sam behind. A massive horde of wights, led by White Walkers, approach the Fist.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Eddison_Tollett</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascEddisonTollett</string></dict>
        <key>Edmyn Tully</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.55.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Edmyn Tully was the Lord of Riverrun and a vassal of King Harren the Black, though he rebelled against him when Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros.
            After the elimination of Harren and his entire line at the Burning of Harrenhal, Aegon rewarded Edmyn by elevating the Tullys to rule over the Riverlands (under the Targaryens), even though they had never ruled the Riverlands as kings - indeed, the Riverlands had been occupied by powerful neighboring kingdoms for centuries, and before that were rarely politically unified. Aegon made Edmyn Tully the first Lord Paramount of the Trident, a title his family would hold up until the Red Wedding.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Edmyn Tully's backstory is the same.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Edmyn_Tully</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascEdmynTully</string></dict>
        <key>Edmure Tully</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.56.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Edmure Tully is the son and heir of the late Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun. He is the younger brother of Catelyn and Lysa, nephew of Brynden Tully, and maternal uncle of Robb Stark, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Bran Stark, Rickon Stark, and Robin Arryn. He fights for his nephew, King Robb Stark, during the War of the Five Kings.
            Edmure's mother Minisa Tully died in childbirth during his early childhood. He has two elder sisters Catelyn and Lysa. He was also raised with his father's ward, Petyr Baelish. It was Edmure who first nicknamed him "Littlefinger."
            CatelynÂ is the widow of the late Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Lord Paramount of the North, and Lysa is the widow of Jon Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie and Lord Paramount of the Vale.[2]
            Tyrion is accused of the attempted murder ofÂ Bran StarkÂ andÂ taken prisonerÂ byÂ Catelyn Stark. Tywin Lannister launches an invasion on the Riverlands as a response. Jaime smashes the river lords at the battle of the Golden Tooth and lays siege to Riverrun. Edmure is not specifically mentioned, but he presumably takes part in the defense of his region.
            Edmure is first mentioned in a conversation between Robb Stark and Rickard Karstark. Rickard states that the march to Hoster's funeral is a distraction, but Robb tells him that Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. Rickard remains unconvinced and doesn't think he has enough men to make a difference in the war effort.[3]
            Edmure presides over the funeral of his father, per the custom of House Tully, in which the departed is placed on a funeral boat and set on flames with a flaming arrow. Edmure fails at hitting the boat three times in a row, causing his annoyed uncle to push him away and complete the deed himself.
            After the funeral, Ser Brynden chides his nephew for attacking Stone Mill. Edmure proudly asserts that his "blunder" sent Gregor Clegane scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. He says that they will not win this war if Robb is the only one winning any battles, and that there is enough glory to go around. Robb responds angrily and tells him it is not about glory, before reminding him that his instructions were to wait for the Mountain to come to him. Robb informs him of his plan; he wanted to draw the Mountain to the west, into their country, where he could surround and kill him. Edmure tells Robb they took hostages, including Martyn and Willem Lannister. More than two hundred men were lost in the battle, less than what the Lannisters lost, but Robb furiously tells him that they need their men more than Tywin needs his. Edmure apologizes for his mistakes, but subtly tells Robb that it would not have happened had he known of his plan from the beginning.[4]
            After Lord Rickard murders Willem and Martyn Lannister, Edmure insists that if word of this leaves Riverrun, Tywin Lannister will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews. Therefore, he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys, and simply keep silent about their deaths until the war is over. Robb, however, refuses to be a liar: he says he cannot fight a war in the name of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks. Catelyn says they should keep Lord Rickard hostage, and Edmure agrees, adding that Robb should tell the other Karstarks that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal. Robb ignores their pleas, and he has Lord Karstark brought out to the courtyard of Riverrun to be executed during a driving rainstorm. Edmure then witnesses the execution.[5]
            When emissaries from House Frey arrive at Riverrun to negotiate Walder Frey's terms of reconciliation with Robb Stark, Edmure is pressured by Robb, Brynden and Catelyn to take Robb's place in his previously arranged marriage to Roslin Frey. Edmure initially refuses, stating that the laws of gods and men are very clear; no man can compel another man to marry. His uncle Brynden threatens him and tells him that the laws of his fists are about to compel his teeth. Robb tells him that if he refuses, his alliance with the Freys is dead. Edmure wants to pick one of his daughters for himself, the same courtesy that was given to Robb. He thinks that if he refuses, Walder will come back and offer him a daughter of his own choosing. Catelyn scolds him, angrily asking him if he is willing to risk their freedom and lives for a chance at a prettier wife. Robb reminds him that he wanted to make amends for his military blunder at the Stone Mill, but Edmure had something less permanent in mind. Robb eventually manages to convince him and Edmure reluctantly agrees.[6]
            InÂ the Riverlands, en route toÂ The Twins, Robb's army is forced to make camp, their progress delayed by heavy rain. Catelyn warns them that the pricklyÂ Lord FreyÂ will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him, but EdmureÂ points out that Frey is getting the wedding he wanted; his sister counters that he is gettingÂ aÂ wedding, but not the one he wanted, glaring at her son and his wife as she says so, pointing out that Frey wanted one of his daughters wed to a king. Robb retorts that Edmure is the best matchÂ House FreyÂ has been offered in its history.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Edmure_Tully</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascEdmureTully</string></dict>

        <key>Ebrose</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.58.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ebrose is an Archmaester of the Citadel, one of the governing members of the Order of Maesters.
            At some point early in his life, Ebrose committed himself to the life of a maester, and would have studied at the Citadel in order to forge his chain of service. Eventually he rose through the ranks, ultimately achieving the position of Archmaester, making him one of the most senior members of the order.
            Despite Ebrose explicitly forbidding him form treating Ser Jorah, Sam does so anyways and is able to cure him.[2] When Ebrose arrives in the morning to see to Jorah, he finds him completely healed. Despite being told by Jorah that no one tended to him, Ebrose realizes immediately what Sam has done and calls him into his office. There, he congratulates Sam on saving Jorah's life with a procedure few Maesters have ever mastered. He then immediately orders Sam, who had expected a reward, to copy some old scrolls and tells him that his reward is not being banished from the Citadel for ignoring orders.[3]
            Later, Ebrose and the other Maesters discuss Bran Stark's letter warning that the army of the dead and the White Walkers are marching south towards Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. He and the other Maesters are skeptical of this report and dismiss Samwell Tarly's efforts to vouch for Bran. Ebrose himself opines that the letter could be disinformation spread by the self-proclaimed Queen Daenerys Targaryen. They agree to investigate these claims further and to send a letter to Winterfell inquiring into Bran's claims. When Samwell leaves the room, the other Archmaesters discuss the death of his father and brother, however, Ebrose announces that he had not had the heart to tell Sam of their fate.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ebrose is an Archmaester of the Citadel. Each Archmaester bears a ring, rod, and mask forged of a certain metal to designate expertise in a particular field of study. Ebrose's ring, rod, and mask are silver, signifying his mastery of the healing arts. The Citadel is structured somewhat like a university, by which analogy Ebrose is essentially the head professor of medicine. Some fields of study are more respected than others: study of the "higher mysteries" (Magic) is thought of as lowly and trivial, but the archmaester of medicine is very highly respected, as it is one of the core duties of maesters.
            As an Archmaester, Ebrose sits on the Conclave - the ruling body of the Order of Maesters, and is responsible for electing the Grandmaester to the king's Small Council.
            Acolytes training to become maesters must study under Ebrose in order to earn a link of silver for their chains. He is regarded as a patient and kindly tutor, but is known to become exasperated when dealing with the persistent failures of an unpromising student. One such pupil, named Pate, once remarked that Ebrose's "weary sighs" were just as hurtful as the outright insults of Archmaester Vaellyn.
            Qyburn conducted human experimentation, unethically vivisecting living men to further his medical research: it is explicitly said that one of the things driving him was a desire to surpass even Archmaester Ebrose as a healer. When the maesters (including Ebrose) found out what he was doing, they expelled Qyburn from their order.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ebrose</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascEbrose</string></dict>
        <key>Hugh</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.59.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hugh, called Ser Hugh of the Vale, was a freshly made knight. He was killed by a splintered lance while jousting with Ser Gregor Clegane.
            Hugh served as Lord Jon Arryn's squire for four years before Jon Arryn's death. After Arryn's death, Hugh was knighted for his loyal service by King Robert Baratheon. When Lady Lysa Arryn returned to the Eyrie with her son, Ser Hugh elected to remain in King's Landing in the King's service.
            Lord Eddard Stark sends Jory Cassel to quiz Ser Hugh about Jon Arryn's death. Ser Hugh refuses to talk to Jory since he isn't a knight. Ser Hugh takes part in the tournament to celebrate Eddard's arrival and is killed by a splintered lance during a joust with Ser Gregor Clegane.[1]
            Lord Commander Barristan Selmy stands the knight's vigil for Ser Hugh overnight. Eddard ponders how Hugh could afford arms and armor so soon after being knighted, leading him to suspect that Hugh was involved in Jon Arryn's death. Varys later agrees that this is the most likely explanation, and that the Lannisters ordered him killed to prevent him talking (Ser Gregor is in the Lannister's service).[2]
            * Only appears as a corpse.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Hugh is a reasonably effective warrior but is newly-proud and slightly drunk on his achievement of becoming a knight.
            Lord Stark met Ser Barristan at a cart transporting Ser Hugh's remains after the Silent Sisters had dressed him. Ser Barristan explains that he did stand vigil alone, but Ser Hugh apparently has a mother in the Vale and the remains are being sent to her. Ser Hugh's armor is new since he had it made especially for the tournament and has not been completely paid for, but Lord Stark will deal with the armorer himself and insists to the Silent Sister accompanying the cart that Ser Hugh's mother receive his armor since he knows it will mean something to her.
            When Grand Maester Pycelle is being accused by Tyrion Lannister of fatally poisoning Jon Arryn, Pycelle denies it while accusing Ser Hugh of doing it and that VarysÂ and Queen Cersei will concur with Pycelle about Ser Hugh's guilt.
            Upon being knighted, Ser Hugh's sigil is a blue field bordered in crescent moons.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Hugh</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHugh</string></dict>
        <key>Hugor of the Hill</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.60.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hugor of the Hill was the legendary first king of the Andals.
            According to legend, in ancient times the Seven gods walked the earth among men, and they blessed Hugor of the Hill, king of the Andals. The Father pulled down seven stars from the heavens and set them upon the brow of Hugor to make a glowing crown. The Maiden then brought him a girl as supple as willow, with eyes like deep pools, whom Hugor declared he would take as his bride. The Mother made her fertile, and the Crone foretold that she would give him forty-four mighty sons. The Warrior gave strength to their arms, and the Smith made a suit of iron plates for both of them.[1] The gods crowned him as King of the Andals, and promised him that his people would one day rule great kingdoms in a foreign continent.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Hugor's story is the same. It is unclear exactly when he is supposed to have lived, though apparently it was some time before the Andal Invasion began (the histories don't mention him in Westeros itself). Due to his legendary status it is unknown if a single king named "Hugor" ever truly existed (much less if he actually met gods), just as among the First Men it is unclear if figures such as Durran Godsgrief ever truly lived and warred against gods of the sea and sky.
            While Tyrion Lannister is travelling away from Westeros, one of the assumed names he uses is Hugor Hill - "Hill" being the bastard surname used in the Westerlands. Tyrion uses this name when he is traveling east from Pentos through Andalos - thinking to himself on how the legendary Hugor allegedly lived there, and pondering how his own Andal ancestors once walked the same lands he is now crossing through.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Hugor_of_the_Hill</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHugoroftheHill</string></dict>
        <key>Howland Reed</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.61.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Howland Reed is the head of House Reed, the Lord of Greywater Watch, and the father of Meera and Jojen Reed. At the end of Robert's Rebellion, he accompanied Eddard Stark to the Tower of Joy in the Red Mountains of Dorne in an attempt to rescue Lyanna Stark. He and Eddard were the only survivors of the showdown between the Northmen and the remaining Kingsguard loyal to House Targaryen.
            Howland Reed is the Lord of Greywater Watch and the father of Meera and Jojen Reed. The head of House Reed, he is a loyal vassal of House Stark, ruling over the bog-filled lands of the Neck and the crannogmen.
            Reed first met his liege lords at the great tourney at Harrenhal when he was a young man. While taking in the magnificence of the tourney, three squires, all larger than him as crannogmen are known to be shorter and smaller than most men in Westeros, started to beat and curse him as a "frog eater", until Lyanna Stark came to his defense; there he eventually met up with the rest of members of House Stark present: Brandon, Eddard, and Benjen. Later in the tourney, the Knight of the Laughing Tree defended Reed's honour by jousting and defeating the knights of the squires mentioned, and the only prize the mysterious knight asked for was that the defeated knights teach their squires honour. Reed would later tell his tourney experiences to his two children.[1]
            According to Bran Stark in a conversation with Jojen Reed, Howland saved Ned Stark's life during Robert's Rebellion. Howland apparently never told his children anything about his part in the rebellion.[2]
            While traveling in the Gift, Bran and Jojen talk about Howland Reed and his relation to Ned Stark. Jojen remembers that when he told his father about his visions of what had happened to Ned Stark, it was the first time he saw his father cry.[3]
            Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven watch the fight at the Tower of Joy between Ned Stark, Howland Reed, and four other Stark bannermen against two members of Aerys II Targaryen's Kingsguard; Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, and Lord Commander Gerold Hightower. Howland Reed is the first to charge in, receiving a slash across the chest by Dayne. The other Stark bannermen are killed along with Ser Gerold, leaving Ned Stark and Dayne to face each other. The two warriors briefly duel. However, Dayne's superior fighting skills get the best of Ned and he is disarmed. Just as Dayne is about to strike Ned down, Howland - whom Dayne had assumed was mortally wounded earlier in the fight - rushes him from behind and stabs him through the back of the neck. Ned quickly ends Dayne's suffering with a slash to the neck, nearly lopping his head off. Howland is badly injured but survives, rushing to check the bodies of the fallen, while Ned continues on into the tower.[4][5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Howland Reed is a member and the ruler of the crannogmen, the inhabitants of the Neck. Disparagingly called "frog-eaters" because their lands are in the swamps of the Neck, the Reeds and the crannogmen keep to themselves and rarely travel beyond their borders. However, Howland Reed was an exception to this, becoming a noted friend and ally of Lord Eddard Stark, fighting at his side during Robert's Rebellion. He remains one of House Stark's staunchest supporters but, so far, hasn't played a role in the War of the Five Kings.
            In the third novel, Robb Stark sends Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover to the Neck, to inform Howland Reed about his plan to retake Moat Cailin from the ironborn; Robb is certain that Howland will not let him down. Robb is killed, however, before the plan can be realized. It is unknown whether Maege and Galbart reach their destination.
            One point of note mentioned in the books is the fact that Howland Reed was with Ned when he finally rescued Lyanna Stark. Howland was one of only two survivors of that mission; the other was Ned himself. With the death of Ned Stark, Reed is the only survivor of that battle left.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Howland_Reed</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHowlandReed</string></dict>
        <key>Hoster Tully</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.62.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Hoster Tully was the Lord of Riverrun, the Lord Paramount of the Trident and the head of House Tully, one of the Great Houses of Westeros. He was the father of Edmure, Catelyn and Lysa and the older brother of Brynden. He ruled over the Riverlands from the castle of Riverrun. During the War of the Five Kings, he declared for House Stark and his grandson Robb Stark, the King in the North.
            Hoster was the head of House Tully and the Lord Paramount of the Riverlands. The Riverlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Tully is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Tully rules the region from their seat at Riverrun and Hoster also holds the title Lord of Riverrun.[1]
            Hoster married Lady Minisa of House Whent. They have three children, two daughters Catelyn and Lysa and a son, Edmure. Only three of their six children survived. Minisa died shortly after bearing their last child, which died with her. Hoster brokered a marriage alliance with House Stark, the ruling house of the North betrothing his eldest daughter Catelyn to their heir Brandon Stark.[1]
            Hoster fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings where Lord Baelish befriended him and later agreed to foster his son Petyr at Riverrun.[2] When he returned from the war, he arranged a marriage for his brother Brynden to Bethany Redwyne, but Brynden refused causing Hoster to nickname him "The Blackfish" and a falling out between the brothers that lasted the rest of Hoster's life.[3][4]
            The Mad King Aerys II Targaryen had Brandon Stark and his father brutally executed, triggering a rebellion against him. Hoster joined House Stark, House Baratheon and House Arryn in opposing the Mad King. Catelyn married Brandon's brother Eddard Stark and Hoster arranged for Lysa to marry Lord Jon Arryn to solidify the alliance. They won the war and installed Robert Baratheon as the King on the Iron Throne. The army of Lord Walder Frey, Hoster's bannerman, arrived after the Battle of the Trident had already been won by the rebels, causing Hoster to nickname him "the Late Lord Frey" to Lord Walder's great irritation.[5][6]
            In recent years Hoster had become old and frail, losing a great deal of weight.[1] By the beginning of the War of the Five Kings, Hoster had been bedridden for a considerable amount of time from a prolonged illness, and only semi-coherent. His son and heir Edmure took over the day-to-day rule of Riverrun, and Hoster's other duties as overlord of the Riverlands.
            Lord Hoster finally passed away shortly after the Battle of the Blackwater. Hoster's brother Brynden, son Edmure, daughter Catelyn, and grandson Robb Stark are present for his funeral at Riverrun. As per Tully funeral tradition, his body is set adrift on the Red Fork of the Trident River in a funeral boat, and then set on fire by a flaming arrow - so that his ashes will return to the river which sustains their lands. Brynden tells Catelyn that he and Hoster managed to make peace before his death. Hoster told Brynden to stop calling himself "The Blackfish" as it is an old joke and it wasn't very funny to begin with. Following Hoster's death, his son Edmure inherits his titles and lands, and officially becomes the new head of House Tully.[4]
            While traveling through the Riverlands, Arya Stark tells a farmer that Sandor Clegane is her father and knight in service of Hoster Tully. The farmer curses Lord Walder Frey for the Red Wedding and comments that the Freys are terrible lords compared to Hoster Tully.[7]
            Fearing for the life of his son, Edmure, who has been a prisoner of the Freys since the Red Wedding, reluctantly agrees to help his captors retake Riverrun from his uncle Brynden. He approaches the gate and identifies himself, invokes his father's name.[8]
            On the DVD commentary for the episode "Walk of Punishment", David Benioff and D.B. Weiss reveal that Hoster is played by the show'sÂ line producer Christopher Newman.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Hoster is an old, spent man close to the end of his life. In his prime he was a canny politician and effective military commander, and was a vital supporter of Robert Baratheon's uprising against the Targaryen dynasty. He was married to Lady Minisa Whent, of the great castle of Harrenhal, who passed away some years before the events of the series begin.
            In A Game of Thrones, Catelyn visits her father after Robb Stark breaks the siege in the Battle of the Camps. At that point, Hoster is still lucid. In the next books, his health deteriorates rapidly. Most of the time he loses contact with reality, does not recognize his children, and mumbles incoherently.
            At one of those occasions, Catelyn hears her father mumbles: "Tansy... forgive me... the blood... oh, please... Tansy... dead. You'll have others... Sweet babes, and trueborn. Be a good wife and the gods will bless you... sons... trueborn sons". At first Catelyn thinks that her father might have wronged some village maiden named Tansy, but after thinking it over, recalling Lysa's tearful reaction when Catelyn let her hold baby Robb, she realizes the terrible secret that haunts her father on his deathbed: Lysa got pregnant some time before her marriage to Jon Arryn, and their father forced her to undergo an abortion by drinking Moon tea (one of its ingredients is the herb called Tansy). Near his death, Hoster feels deep regret for what he did to his daughter. Catelyn writes to her sister about it, telling her that their father's thoughts are all of the wrong he did Lysa, and that he needs her forgiveness, begging her at least to write him a few words of love so he may die in peace. Catelyn feels the letter is too little and too late for her father is likely to die before Lysa answers, but sends it anyway. Lysa does not respond.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Hoster_Tully</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHosterTully</string></dict>

            Hizdahr belongs to the ancient aristocratic House of Loraq, who have been one of the ruling families of slavemasters in Meereen for many generations.
            Hizdahr zo Loraq is fluent in the Common Tongue of Westeros, which is not unusual for merchants in Essos, as they take part in long-distance trade.[2]
            His father is crucified in the aftermath of the siege, a matter which he later confronts her about personally. Hizdahr pleads to be allowed to bury him at the Temple of the Graces, to which she agrees, after learning that he had opposed the crucifixion of the slave children as an ill-conceived warning against Daenerys.[4]
            Some weeks later, Daenerys tells Jorah Mormont to send Hizdahr to Yunkai as her ambassador. Hizdahr is to offer the Wise Masters a choice: they can "live in her new world" and accept the abolition of slavery, or "die in their old one" at the hands of the Second Sons sent under the command of Daario Naharis.[5]
            Hizdahr later becomes a member of Daenerys's small council, representing the former Great Masters. After White Rat's killer is caught, he and Mossador butt heads over what to do with him. Hizdahr disagrees with Mossador's insistence that the Sons of the Harpy are funded by the Great Masters. Mossador ultimately kills the murderer without Daenerys's consent, and Hizdahr witnesses his execution, voicing his opinion that Daenerys should have killed Mossador inside the pyramid with few witnesses instead of publicly executing him.[7]
            On the day that usually marks the traditional opening of the fighting season Hizdahr again entreats Daenerys to reopen the fighting pits, noted that while it is not a perfect solution, it will at least be enough to bring the Meereenese and Yunkish Masters to the table.[8]
            Following the skirmish that claimed the life of Ser Barristan Selmy, Hizdahr visits Daenerys to offer his condolences. He and Daario offer advice on how to deal with the Sons of the Harpy, but Daenerys coolly informs them that she will take the heads of Meereen's great houses into custody. When Hizdahr points out that this description applies to him, the Unsullied grab him immediately. Hizdahr and the other heads of house are brought into the catacombs. As the Unsullied drive them forward, Daenerys explains that she has no idea which of them are guilty and which are innocent (including Hizdahr). When Rhaegal appears and roasts one of the Great Masters alive, Hizdahr is the only one of the remaining Masters to remain standing, offering as his defense a halfhearted "valar morghulis". Daenerys, having reminded the Great Masters of what she (and her dragons) can do, allows them to leave with their lives, but keeps them under arrest. Later, she visits Hizdahr in his cell. His composure now gone, he prostrates himself before her and begs for mercy, his public calm replaced with terror. Daenerys is pleased that he's now being honest again, and informs him that in the interests of peace she will reopen the Fighting Pits (to free men only). She will also show her respect for Meereen by marrying a member of one of its great families â and fortuitously, she already has one of them on their knees before her.[9]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Hizdahr zo Loraq is also a scion of the House of Loraq. He is described as tall and slender, with flawless amber skin. In keeping with the elaborate hairdos the Meereenese favor, his red-black Ghiscari hair is styled into a pair of harpy's wings, until he has it shaved in an attempt to please Daenerys. He has never been married, and has two bastard children.
            Hizdahr is actually the fourteenth member of the House of Loraq to bear that name. He is descended from a long line of famous Meereenese nobles, including the original "Hizdahr zo Loraq", who was also known as "Hizdahr the Handsome". The current Hizdahr is formally addressed as "Hizdahr, Fourteenth of That Noble Name".
            The novels do not reveal if Hizdhar's father was among the people who were crucified at Daenerys's command as retribution for the crucifixion of the slave children. Hizdahr is also less personally involved with Daenerys in the books. He petitions the reopening of the fighting pits primarily because he owns them, and he is recommended as a husband by the Green Grace, rather than Daenerys choosing him herself. He is also rather meek and ineffectual, whereas the TV version is quite bold and is a skilled negotiator.
            In the novels, Hizdahr, while a constant presence at court during petition sessions, is not a member of Daenerys's council. The novel character closer to this role is Reznak mo Reznak, a seneschal who is the figure closest to Meereenese traditions among Dany's court.
            After Daenerys conquers Meereen, she has the fighting pits closed. As a result, the value of pit shares had plummeted. Hizdahr zo Loraq has purchases much of the shares, and became the owner of most of the fighting pits. He repeatedly requests Daenerys to reopen the pits. Daenerys initially refuses, but he persuades her to by introducing her the seven most formidable pit fighters, who assure Daenerys they are not forced to participate the fighting.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Hizdahr_zo_Loraq</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHizdahrzoLoraq</string></dict>
        <key>Hodor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.64.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hodor, originally named Wylis,[1] was a simpleminded servant of House Stark at Winterfell working in the stables.
            Hodor is on the road to Castle Black, along with Bran, Rickon, Osha and the direwolves, Summer and Shaggydog. Bran continues to dream about chasing the Three-Eyed Raven. In his dreams, he also encounters a strange boy, who he later meets while awake. The boy turns out to be Jojen Reed, accompanied by his sister, Meera. Jojen possesses the rare gift of seeing the past and present through his dreams, and is able to speak with Bran through their dreams. Jojen tells Bran that he is a warg, someone who can control the minds of animals.[13]
            After seeking shelter in a derelict windmill during a rainstorm, the group notice a band of wildlings chasing down an old man. The sounds of thunder terrify Hodor, who shouts out in panic. Fearing discovery, Jojen tells Bran to silence Hodor, who keeps panicking. Bran unintentionally uses his warg powers to render Hodor unconscious. With the wildlings still outside, Jojen convinces Bran to warg through Summer and Shaggydog outside, who then maul to some of the wildlings to death. While in control of Summer and Shaggydog, Bran saw Jon Snow outside fighting the wildlings. He tells Osha to take Rickon with her to the holdfast of Jon Umber, a loyal bannerman of the Starks. Bran bids a tearful Rickon farewell, who leaves with Osha and Shaggydog, while Bran continues northward with Hodor, Summer and the Reed siblings.[14] Later, the group arrives at the Wall and stay overnight in an abandoned castle. During the night, Samwell Tarly, with Gilly and her child, meet Bran and the Reeds in the castle. Samwell, noticing the gigantic Hodor and Summer, realizes who Bran is and offers to take them to Castle Black. They refuse and Jojen tells Sam that they are going beyond the Wall, as no force in the realm of Westeros could withstand the threat posed by the White Walkers. Sam reluctantly gives them the obsidian blades as well as obsidian arrowheads found north of the Wall, which he earlier used to slay a White Walker. True to his gentle nature, Hodor initially does not want to take the blade offered to him, only taking it when directly told to do so. That night, Bran, the Reeds, Hodor and Summer finally pass beyond the Wall.[15]
            HodorÂ is captured by the mutineers alongside his companions when they scout Craster's Keep and attempt to free Summer and Ghost. While Bran, Jojen, and Meera are taken inside the keep, Hodor is chained up outside and abused by the mutineers. RastÂ stabs Hodor in the leg with a spear and chastises him for not fighting back, stating that if he was as big as Hodor, he would be "king of the fucking world".[16]Locke âattempts to kidnap Bran during the Raid on Craster's Keep, Bran wargs into Hodor and ambushes Locke. Using his immense strength, the Bran-controlled Hodor lifts Locke off the ground and snaps his neck. Hodor is visibly disturbed when he regains control of his body. He later escapes with the rest of his companions. As the group continues to travel north, they finally arrive to the Heart treeÂ from Bran's visions. The sun is low on the horizon as they approaching the tree, and the group is soon ambushed by skeletalÂ wights. Bran wargs into Hodor again to fend them off, but there are too many of them. As they are about to be overwhelmed, one of the Children of the Forest saves the group with her magic fire balls. Hodor carries Bran into the cave beneath the Heart tree where the wights cannot reach them, and brings him near the Three-Eyed Raven.[17]
            Hodor remains with Bran in the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven as the young Stark explores his abilities. Bran has a vision of Hodor in his youth, named Wylis, as an articulate and well-liked stablehand. He helps Lyanna Stark from her horse while watching Ned Stark spar with Benjen Stark. Lyanna suggests that Benjen find a new sparring partner with Hodor after Ned leaves for the Eyrie, and gives Hodor fencing tips. Hodor and Benjen almost have a match when Old Nan comes outside and discourages Hodor from learning to fight, since he is a stableboy, though Ned remarks that with his size, Hodor would make a formidable fighter. Bran later attempts to use Hodor's original name and get him to speak, but gets only "Hodor" in response. Hodor later carries Bran outside the cave to speak with Meera, then brings him back in when it becomes clear Meera doesn't want to talk.[18]
            When the White Walkers and thousands of wights attack the cave as a result of Bran's reckless warging, Hodor holds the back exit of the cave to allow Bran and Meera time to escape. Bran inadvertently wargs into Wylis, linking the minds of the present-day Hodor and the young stableboy from the past. This mental trauma causes Wylis to suffer a seizure, during which he hears Meera shouting the phrase "Hold the door!" through Bran and begins repeating it, eventually slurring the sentence together until it becomes "Hodor". Through Bran's warging, young Wylis experiences his own future death, damaging his mind.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Hodor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHodor</string></dict>

            On their way back to the Wall from the mutiny at Craster's Keep,Â Sam mentionsÂ to GillyÂ that Hobb makes a very tasty venison stew with onions.[1]
            While staying at Castle Black,Â Gilly plucks geese and takes them to Hobb in the kitchens.[2]
            Acting Commander Thorne warns Jon Snow that Hobb will serve his direwolf Ghost for supper if the creature isn't locked up.[3]
            During the Battle of Castle Black, a small wildling party comes from the south and breaches the walls of the keep, and some of them break into the kitchen.Â Hobb calmly walks up to the wildlings, still wearing his apron, and lands his hog-splitter into the chest of one of them.[4]

        <key>Harwyn Hoare</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.67.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Harwyn Hoare was a King of the Isles and the Rivers.
            Harwyn was born to King Qhorwyn Hoare, although he had never sailed his father's fleet, nor had he ever fought with his swords. He was unruly and useless to his father, and was sent east to vanish. He raided with pirates and fought with mercenaries in Essos.[1]
            When Qhorwyn died, Harwyn returned to the Iron Islands for the Kingsmoot as a candidate. His elder brother Harlan, although under suspicious circumstances, soon fell off his horse and died, and Harwyn was elected without objection. He sailed his father's fleet to Westeros and conquered an area ten times the size of the Iron Islands in the Riverlands. The weak riverlords had not expected a commander skilled at both sea and land warfare, but Harwyn had learned more of war than most of his fellow Ironborn from his time in Essos.[1]
            In his youth Harwyn raided theÂ StepstonesÂ and visitedÂ Free CitiesÂ such asÂ Volantis,Â Tyrosh,Â Braavos, andÂ Lys. He was a captive in theÂ Basilisk IslesÂ for two years, served as aÂ sellswordÂ in theÂ Disputed Lands, and joined theÂ Second Sons, with whom he fought in several battles.
            Harwyn succeeded his ailing father, KingÂ Qhorwyn the Cunning, although Harwyn had only been third in line to theÂ Seastone Chair. His eldest brother had already died ofÂ greyscaleÂ two years prior, but the middle brother, PrinceÂ Harlan, died after falling from a horse. Though it was said to be an accident, the death was considered suspicious especially when King Qhorwyn passed six days later, allowing Harwyn to claim the throne asÂ King of the Iron Islands.
            Harwyn planned the invasion of theÂ Riverlands, which were weakly held by theÂ Storm KingÂ Arrec Durrandon. TheÂ ironborn landed one hundred longships south ofÂ SeagardÂ and then carried the ships to theÂ Blue Fork.Â Samwell Rivers' small host was shattered by Harwyn's charge at theÂ Tumblestone. Harwyn then defeated the army of LadyÂ Agnes Blackwood, who was betrayed by LordÂ Lothar Bracken. Harwyn was impressed with Agnes and offered her to become hisÂ salt wife, but the king killed her when she refused.
            The Storm King Arrec then met Harwyn in aÂ battle at Fairmarket. Aided by many river lords, including Lothar Bracken,Â Theo Charlton, and LordsÂ Goodbrook,Â Paege, andÂ Vypren, the Hoares crushed theÂ stormlandersÂ and Arrec's rule over the Riverlands collapsed. The rivermen had hoped to regain their independence and celebrated at first, but Harwyn retained control for himself. Lord Bracken had desired to beÂ river king; he rose in rebellion six months later, which resulted in him starving to death in a crow cage.
            Harwyn spent most of his reign ruling and suppressing rebellions in the riverlands rather than theÂ Iron Islands. Harwyn died in bed with a salt wife at the age of 64, and he was succeeded asÂ King of the Isles and the RiversÂ by his son,Â Halleck Hoare.Â Harwyn was the grandfather ofÂ Harren Hoare.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Harwyn_Hoare</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHarwynHoare</string></dict>
        <key>Harys</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.68.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Harys is a man-at-arms sworn to House Whitehill, and a member of Gryff Whitehill's garrison of Ironrath.
            Harys arrives with Gryff at Ironrath late at night, and sets a cart on fire before introducing his commander. He and the and the other Whitehill soldiers then leave to quarter in the Forresters' Great Hall.
            Harys later watches as several members of the Whitehill garrison act out Ethan Forrester's death at the hands of Ramsay Snow, much to the dismay of his mother and brother. This prompts Rodrik to angrily threaten or strike one of the soldiers, but Harys ends the confrontation before it escalates further, saying that Gryff will deal with the Forrester lord.
            When Gryff brings out Talia Forrester to be punished for biting one of his men, he eventually punches Rodrik, knocking him onto the ground. Royland Degore is outraged by this, and threatens to attack the Whitehill soldiers. Should Rodrik allow him to do so, the master-at-arms incapacitates two of the men before Harys knocks him down and disarms him. He then keeps Royland under guard for the rest of the confrontation.
            Harys participates in the beating of Maester Ortengryn, alongside Gryff. Upon the arrival of Arthur Glenmore and his Elite Guard, Harys is greatly angered. He is taken prisoner along with the other Whitehill soldiers.
            Harys is freed by the traitor shortly before his identity is discovered by Rodrik, along with the rest of the Whitehill garrison.
            Harys later participates in the ambush of Asher Forrester'sÂ hired forces as they arrive in Westeros. As The Beast attempts to raise the gate that trapped Asher and Rodrik with the Whitehill soldiers, Harys hurdles a spear at him, killing the pit fighter. When Asher or Rodrik remain behind, Harys stabs them in the side and bashes one of their eyes in, shortly before they die of their wounds.
            Harys appears at the gates of Ironrath holding Ryon if Rodrik is the one who died in the previous episode. He appears at the siege is Asher is the one who died but has no significant role or lines. He appears at the battle at Ironrath on horseback blocking Asher/Rodrik from killing Ludd or Gryff. He engages in a long and bloody fight with Rodrik/Asher, nearly pushing Asher/Rodrik face into nearby fire before being stabbed in the back by Elissa Forrester who he proceeds to run through with his sword. If Elissa died drinking poison than it will be either Bowen, Erik, or an unnamed solider who stabs him and is than promptly killed. He manages to impale Rodrik/Asher with a his great sword and begins to sadistically twist the blade. This offers Rodrik/Asher the opportunity to hack at his neck with a hand axe twice, and then finally kill him by impaling him through the mouth with the Forrester family great sword.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Harys</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHarys</string></dict>

            After meeting the force led by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont at the Fist of the First Men, Qhorin selects Stonesnake, Harker, and Borba for a scouting party to ambush a group of wildling lookouts. They are joined by Jon Snow.[1] They locate and surprise the lookouts, killing all but one of them. Jon is left to execute the wildling survivor.[2] Jon does not return and they return for him. They pick up his tracks but are ambushed by wildlings. Harker, Stonesnake and Borba are killed while Qhorin is captured. Jon had spared the captive and she leads him into a similar ambush. Qhorin seizes the opportunity to insert Jon as an infiltrator in the wildling ranks by berating him for the deaths of the others publicly.[3]

        <key>Harrion Karstark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.71.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Harrion Karstark was the eldest son of Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold and head of House Karstark. He fought alongside his father for King Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings and was killed at the beginning of the war. It is heavily implied that Harrion was killed by Ser Jaime Lannister; Theon Greyjoy reminds Robb that the Kingslayer cut down ten of their men before his capture.[1][2]
            When Catelyn Stark frees Jaime Lannister out of fear that Rickard Karstark will surely kill him in retaliation for murdering his younger son Torrhen Karstark, she tries to justify her actions on the grounds that the Lannisters have her daughters. Rickard angrily reminds Catelyn that he has now lost two sons as Harrion was killed fighting by Robb's side in battle.[3]
            While conversing with Roose Bolton over the slaughter of Northern prisoners at Harrenhal, Rickard again laments the loss of his sons while their killer roams free, implying that it was Jaime who killed Harrion as well as Torrhen. Roose assures Rickard that the debt will be paid.[2]
            Later, Lord Rickard breaks into the dungeon at Riverrun and kills Willem and Martyn Lannister as vengeance for the deaths of Harrion and Torrhen. However, Robb Stark does not accept his rationale, and executes him for murder.[4]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Harrion Karstark is the eldest son of Lord Rickard and joins his father and brothers in the War of the Five Kings.
            Harrion takes part in the Battle of the Green Fork and taken as a hostage whileÂ it is his brother Eddard who is killed by Jaime Lannister during the Battle of the Whispering Wood. Eddard serves alongside his brother Torrhen as part of Robb Stark's personal bodyguard. When Jaime realizes that his army is lost during the Battle of the Whispering Wood, he makes a final push to single-handedly carve his way through the Northern army in an attempt to kill Robb Stark in single combat. Jaime manages to reach Robb's personal bodyguard and kill several of them, including Eddard and Torrhen, beforeÂ being knocked unconscious.
            Harrion is kept hostage at Harrenhal until the northern prisoners are released by Arya Stark and Jaqen H'ghar and the Brave Companions turn on Ser Amory Lorch to deliver the castle to Lord Roose Bolton. Later Roose sends him, Robett Glover and Helman Tallhart to take Duskendale. They are defeated by the Lannisters. Harrion is taken captive again and his current whereabouts are unknown.
            Following his father's execution by Robb Stark, Harrion becomes Lord of Karhold. It is unknown whether Harrion is aware of that and if he is still alive.
            Harrion's great-uncle Arnolf, who secretly collaborates with the Boltons, tries to get him killed so that he can take over Karhold: he announces in public that he supports Stannis (intending to stab him in the back while fighting the Boltons), hoping that the Lannisters will execute Harrion as a punishment, then his sister Alys will become the heiress of Karhold. Arnolf plans to force Alys to marry his son Cregan and after she gives birth to his son - they will gain ownership legally of Karhold. Alys, however, finds out about Arnolf's twofold treachery, escapes to Castle Black and informs Jon what her great-uncle is up to. She has no idea what became of her brother as a result of Arnolf's fake announcement.
            Harrion's fate has been left unclear in the novels so far, but his death in the television series implies he will die in a later novel.
            Eddard Karstark was apparently switched with his brother Harrion Karstark (or at least, the names were switched) so TV viewers who haven't read the books would not be confused that more than one character named "Eddard" exists, even though George R.R. Martin made it a point in the books to re-use certain names for minor characters, i.e. to emphasize that "Robert Baratheon" isn't the only person named "Robert" in the entire continent of Westeros. In the television series, Torrhen and Harrion are revealed to have a younger brother, but named "Harald" instead of "Eddard".
            In the TV series, Ramsay Snow briefly masquerades as Harrion during one of the mind games that he plays on Theon. This isn't mentioned in the books, as virtually all of Theon's torture takes place off-page, and is only alluded to.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Harrion_Karstark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHarrionKarstark</string></dict>

            Haggo is a Dothraki bloodrider in the service of Khal Drogo. He is one of Drogo's closest allies and a stalwart warrior who favors the Arakh. Unlike Cohollo and Qotho, Haggo wears a leather vest as protection.
            Haggo, alongside Qotho and Cohollo, accompanies Khal Drogo to view his bride, Daenerys Targaryen.[1]
            Haggo is present at the feast in which a drunken Viserys threatens Daenerys and her unborn child. He doesn't take part when Drogo orders Qotho and Cohollo to restrain him while Drogo pours molten gold over his head, killing him.[2]
            Following the raid of a Lhazareen village in Lhazar, MagoÂ defies Drogo. Haggo, along with his fellow bloodriders, steps forward to defendÂ Drogo's honor, only for the Khal to take matters in his own hands.[3]
            Drogo's wound festers and he becomes seriously ill. He falls from his horse in front of the Khalasar, a sign of great weakness. While Daenerys and then Cohollo kneel to the sides of the khal to check on him, Haggo remains mounted alongside Qotho.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Haggo is another of Drogo's bloodriders. During the wedding of Daenerys and Drogo, Haggo gives them a large leather whip with a silver handle. When the three bloodriders attempt to stop the Mirri Maz Duur's blood magic ritual to heal Drogo, Haggo is killed by Rakharo and Jhogo.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Haggo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHaggo</string></dict>

        <key>Hallyne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.75.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hallyne, sometimes called Hallyne the Pyromancer, is the head of the Alchemists' Guild in King's Landing.
            Hallyne is the head of the Alchemists' Guild in King's Landing, in charge of the city's stocks of wildfire and concerned with other fire-related matters.
            During the reign of Aerys II Targaryen, in which the Guild returned to prominence, Hallyne was an acolyte of the Guild. Later, as Robert's Rebellion raged on, Hallyne heard rumors that Aerys had commissioned the Guild's Wisdoms, led by Rossart, to create a great weapon to employ against Robert Baratheon. However, the city was sacked before the weapon could be unleashed and many of the Wisdoms assassinated.[2]
            Queen Regent Cersei Lannister commissions the Alchemist's Guild to produce wildfire for the defense of the city. Hallyne receives Tyrion Lannister at the Guildhall of the Alchemists after he discovers Cersei's plans. Tyrion recalls an old sailorâs proverb âPiss on wildfire and your cock burns off.â Bronn grins and Wisdom Hallyne says that he has never conducted that particular experiment. Hallyne adds that it could be true because "the substance", as pyromancers call wildfire, burns so hot that it can melt wood, stone, steel, and even flesh, which melts "like tallow", according to the aged pyromancer. Hallyne claims that wildfire was the key to the power of House Targaryen after their dragons died out. However, Bronn mocks him and says that he has seen many insane old men pushing carts filled with jars of âpig shitâ around war camps making claims about their substances properties. Hallyne wags a finger at Bronn and assures him that their order does not deal in pig shit. Hallyne tells Tyrion that the substance is fire given form and that they have been perfecting it since the reign of King Maegor Targaryen. Bronn asks what the purpose of wildfire is and Hallyne says that it can be used in catapults.[3]
            Tyrion asks how much they have and Hallyne leads them deeper to the Guildhall's vaults, while Bronn continues to question and mock the usefulness of wildfire while facing a siege. Hallyne, angered, warns that Bronn would not have dared to insult the order of pyromancers while Aerys II Targaryen lived but the sellsword isn't swayed. Hallyne shows them a massive cellar with rows of shelves filled with pots of wildfire. Hallyne says that they have been working tirelessly since receiving Cerseiâs orders and have amassed 7,800 pots. Bronn repeats his fears about it being a bad idea and Tyrion concurs. He says that Hallyne will be making wildfire for him from now on.[3]
            Hallyne arrives on the ramparts of King's Landing close to the Mud Gate during the Battle of the Blackwater. He hands Tyrion the torch to signal springing the wildfire trap; Tyrion has flooded the Blackwater Bay with the substance and is waiting for Stannis' fleet to close on it before triggering an explosion. Hallyne is ecstatic at the destruction wrought on Stannis Baratheon's fleet by the wildfire. The ploy is a success and the Lannisters are able to hold out until reinforcements arrive, winning them the battle.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Hallyne is a self-important man frustrated with the Guild's fall in power and influence since the reign of the Mad King. Hallyne is said to be a "third generation alchemist", i.e. his father and his grandfather were also alchemists.
            Hallyne is rewarded with the title of "lord" after the Battle of the Blackwater, as a reward for providing all of the wildfire which was used decisively in defense of the city. The title is only nominal, however, as he gains no lands or income.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Hallyne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHallyne</string></dict>

        <key>Fennesz</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.77.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Fennesz was a slave in the service of Master Mighdal, one of the Great Masters of Meereen, and charged with educating the children of the household. In his own opinion, he was well treated by his master and loved by the children he taught. He speaks several languages, including Valyrian and the Common Tongue, and knows the history of House Targaryen.[1]
            Some time after her army took Meereen and freed all the slaves, Daenerys Targaryen receives Fennesz at court. He tells her how, in his view, his life became much harder since she "freed" him; he was well-treated and even well-respected in the household, but now he is living on the streets, as the living conditions in the barracks established for the homeless freedmen are terrible. Daenerys is surprised, but eventually allows Fennesz -- and others -- to enter into a contract of employment with his former owner, lasting no more than one year. The old man thanks her and leaves.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no such character. The TV character is a condensation to represent what is happening to many slaves in Meereen:
            When Xaro Xhoan Daxos (who is still alive in the books) visits Daenerys, he scoffs at her attempts to abolish slavery in Meereen and declares that the condition of the ex-slaves she freed is now much worse than before, being forced to perform manual chores that do not fit their skills. As an example, he tells about a friend of his that used to be a rich merchant who dealt with rare spices and choice wines, and now he digs ditches. He begged Xaro to buy him as a slave and take him to Qarth. The role of Fennesz is roughly the same as the ex-slaves that Xaro talked about.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Fennesz</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascFennesz</string></dict>
        <key>Finn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.78.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Finn is a recruit at the Night's Watch. He joined the Night's Watch the same day as Gared Tuttle.
            Finn originates from the area around Raventree Hall, controlled by House Blackwood in the Riverlands. House Blackwood is one of the few major houses outside of the North that continues to worship the Old Gods of the Forest, and Finn does so.[1]
            Finn had an affair with a woman who was married to a lord's son. After the lordling found out about the affair between Finn and his wife, he attempted to murder Finn with a dagger. But Finn easily overpowered the lordling and killed him with his own dagger. He kept the dagger as a trophy. To avoid the death sentence of a common man murdering a nobleman, he went to the Wall.
            At the Wall he began bullying his fellow brothers-in-training. He is trained under Frostfinger, but talks when he addresses the recruits, bragging about his sexual exploits and his murder of a lordling to Gared Tuttle and Cotter. He then takes part in training. He proves himself to be a competent sword-fighter, but lacks restraint and wins through brute strength. He refuses to pick up a crossbow, considering it a coward's weapon, and laughs when Cotter accidentally shoots himself in the toe. He helps lift barrels, and does so with great ease, hefting it over his shoulder, but knocks into Gared in an attempt to make him drop the barrel he's carrying. As he's boasting that he doesn't need to fire a crossbow because he can hit the target with his dagger, he realizes it's missing. He soon works out Cotter has pick-pocketed it and a fight breaks out. Frostfinger breaks up the fight and takes Finn away for punishment, when Finn refuses, Frostfinger smacks him across the face for his insolence and leads him away.[2]
            Finn is made a ranger and goes to the weirwood tree to say his vows with Cotter and Gared, on the way Gared has the option to patch things up with Finn if he stood up for Cotter where he admits the only reason he got so mad at Gared was because he was the closest thing he had to a friend. When they return to Castle Black, Finn stands with Cotter, waiting for Gared to finish talking to his uncle, Duncan. As they stand around Finn and Cotter discuss whether pissing off the Wall could kill a man standing below. Finn and Cotter ask Gared what his uncle came to Castle Black for, Gared lies and Finn comments that he's lying to his brothers already. When Jon Snow decides to go to Craster's Keep to kill their treacherousÂ brothers, both Finn and Cotter agree to go. Cotter reveals he stole Gared's map of the North Grove, Finn laughs at Gared for believing in a rumour told to children and leaves.
            Finn is on duty on the Wall when Gared approaches him next, Finn talks about how he doesn't trust Cotter. Finn waits for his relief, complaining to Frostfinger that they're late.Â Frostfinger is unmoved. Finn leaves and Gared is attacked by Britt, he returns to witness Gared standing over Britt's Body and flees.[3]
            After Gared is arrested by Frostfinger, Finn (falsely) testifies that he witnessed the fight stating either that Gared acted in self defense or murdered Britt in cold blood depending how Gared treated Finn in previous episodes. After Cotter frees Gared from his prison cell in Castle Black, the two may encounter Finn and he will request to join you in deserting the Nights Watch if he testified in Gared's favor earlier.
            Upon going North, they are encountered by a group of female wildlings to which Finn warns Gared not to go near them when Cotter is pinned down by them. After the fight, Finn and Gared carry a wounded Cotter through the Northern Forest, to an abandoned wilding camp, where they encounter Sylvi, Cotter's sister.[4]
            If brought along, the group rest up in the Northern Forest, Finn stands guard keeping watch, he can be interacted with after Gared's talk with Cotter stating that he wanted to come but it isn't how he'd think it'd turn out. He then tends to the fire with Cotter but then a cry for help comes from Finn, the group are encountered by wights.
            During the fight with the wights, Finn moves Gared out of the way after he unsuccessfully tries to kill a wight and tells him that anything can be killed. He battles a wight but is impaled in his upper abdomen by one of the wight's spear, he is told to stay with them while Gared fights off the rest of the remaining wights.
            After the last wight is killed, Cotter asks where Finn is to which Gared will run to where he had left Finn only to find that he has died from his injury.[5]
            Finn is not present in this episode at all if he wasn't brought in episode 4.
            If Finn was killed in the previous episode then his body is among the wights that attack the inhabitants of the North Grove during which Gared kills the cursed body by setting it on fire.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Finn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascFinn</string></dict>

            He and the other Khals meet at the Temple of the dosh khaleen, with their Bloodriders, in order to decided upon if Daenerys Targaryen should enter the Dosh khaleen, after she did not immediately join after Drogo's death. When she enters, she is incompetent towards them, and shows that she has no desire to join the Dosh khaleen. After many sexual insults, she says that she is the only fit to lead the Dothraki. Forzho and the other Khals find the idea preposterous and they assume that she is mad, and they would never follow her. Daenerys says, however, that they will not serve, but die. She then tips over fiery pillars inside the temple, burning all the khals and bloodriders inside, including Forzho.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, no Dothraki Khal named "Forzho" has been mentioned in the storyline as of the fifth novel, A Dance with Dragons.

        <key>Waymar Royce</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.81.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Waymar Royce was a sworn brother of the Night's Watch who was killed by White Walkers.
            Ser Waymar Royce was a knight of House Royce, an ancient and proud noble family of the Vale of Arryn, and the youngest son of Lord Yohn Royce, Lord of Runestone and the head of the family. He joined the Night's Watch and was placed amongst the Rangers due to his noble birth and skill at arms.
            Ser Waymar commands a ranging beyond the Wall, accompanied by Gared and Will, to investigate sightings of wildlings close by. Instead, they find wights and a White Walker. Royce, along with Gared, was brutally killed. Will flees and is eventually executed by Ned Stark for desertion.[1]
            Sansa Stark mentions to Lord Yohn Royce that she had previously met him at Winterfell when Yohn was escorting his son Waymar to the Wall to join the Night's Watch.[2]
            In the unaired pilot episode he was played by Jamie Campbell Bower, but was recast with Rob Ostlere whenÂ the opening sceneÂ was re-shot.
            He is the first character in the series to be killed.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Royce of Runestone is distantly related to House Stark. As is the third and youngest son of "Bronze" Yohn Royce, and therefore having little chance of inheriting lands or wealth, he joined the Night's Watch. Waymar was fast-tracked to being an officer because of his noble blood. Eighteen-year-old Waymar is a skilled warrior, trained by his castle's master-at-arms, but is untested in battle. He is arrogant and has a tendency to underrate the experience of other men due to their lower birth, even though they have been serving on the Wall for longer than he has, but he is not completely stupid. For example, he realized that if the Wall was "weeping" recently (partially melting), it could not be cold enough for eight wildlings with warm clothes, shelter, and material for a fire to simply freeze to death.
            The young Sansa (who was less than 11 years old at the time) developed a massive romantic crush on the handsome young man in the brief time he and his father stayed at Winterfell before he departed to the Wall.
            Despite his youthful arrogance and untested nature, when the White Walkers appear he bravely attempts to fight one in single combat. However, his sword shatters after only a few clashes with the White Walker's ice blade due to its extreme cold. One of the metal shards pierced his left eye, and he was defeated and killed. Will had been hiding in a nearby tree and witnessed the clash. After waiting for some time he hoped the White Walkers had left and climbed down: after examining Waymar's corpse, he went to retrieve his shattered sword-hilt so he could take it back to Castle Black as evidence of what happened. When Will turned to rise again, Waymar stood over him - now revived as a wight, his remaining right eye glowing blue. The wight-Waymar then wrapped its hands around Will's throat and strangled him to death. The TV version changed this around so that Will, not Gared, is the survivor of Waymar's party who escapes but only to be later beheaded by Ned Stark for desertion: Waymar is never shown being revived as a wight, and instead Gared is simply beheaded by another White Walker.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Waymar_Royce</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWaymarRoyce</string></dict>

In the Year of the False Spring, he hosted an extravagant tournament at Harrenhal that brought many from across the realm.
            Lord Whent was the head of House Whent and the Lord of Harrenhal.
            Petyr Baelish discusses with Sansa Stark the great tourney that Lord Whent held at Harrenhal, at which Prince Rhaegar Targaryen shocked the realm by naming Lyanna Stark the Queen of Love and Beauty instead of his own wife Princess Elia Martell.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lord Whent's first is never given and comes from the companion book The World of Ice and Fire.
            Old Lord Whent hosted a great tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC, the Year of the False Spring. The tourney was held to honor his maiden daughter, who held the title of Queen of Love and Beauty when the tourney began. Her crown was defended by her four brothers and her uncle, Ser Oswell Whent of the Kingsguard. Prince Rhaegar Targaryen won the tourney and named Lyanna Stark the Queen of Love and Beauty rather than his wife Princess Elia Martell, to the shock of all of Westeros.
            Ser Jorah Mormont states that he defended a Lord Whent at a tourney at Lannisport in 289 AC, though is unclear if this was Lord Walter or a descendant of his.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Walter_Whent</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWalterWhent</string></dict>

        <key>Three-Eyed Raven</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.85.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The Three-Eyed Raven  was the last Greenseer, a human living among the last of the Children of the Forest beyond the Wall. Under the guise of a three-eyed raven, he appears in Bran Stark's vision-dreams, following his fall and injury, prompting his quest beyond the WallÂ and guiding him to theÂ caveÂ in which his real human body resides.Â There, Bran is trained in the magic of Greensight by the Three-Eyed Raven.
            After his fall from the tower and awakening from the subsequent coma, the raven appears to Bran Stark multiple times in his dreams. In them, it appears as Bran is about to fire an arrow and causes him to stop before he shoots. Then, the raven lands on the head of a direwolf statue, cries once and then flies deep into the Stark family crypt.[1][2] After having the dream again, he becomes convinced the raven is guiding him to the crypts in order to somehow find his father there, even though he is supposed to be alive and well at King's Landing. Anxious to find out, he asks Osha to take him down to the crypts. There, they are surprised by Rickon, who admits to having had the same dreams. Outside, Osha is still trying to tell Bran that it could be a coincidence when a saddened Maester LuwinÂ appears, holding a letter announcing Eddard's death.[3]
            Bran asks Osha about the significance of the Three-Eyed Raven but she does not divulge anything.[4]
            When Bran touches a weirwood in the haunted forests beyond The Wall, he sees flashes of the Three-Eyed Raven from his dreams at Winterfell, flying through the crypts. Among his other vision is a single giant weirwood on a hill, with a voice that whispers, "Look for me... beneath the tree... North!".[7]
            The Three-Eyed Raven monitors Bran as he experiences a vision of Winterfell during the childhood of Lyanna and Ned Stark that reveals Hodor's true name, Wylis. He tells Bran that it is time to go, but when Bran expresses a desire to remain in the happy memories, the Three-Eyed Raven pulls him out of the vision. He warns Bran to resist the urge to only view those happy times, and reminds him that as powerful as Greensight is, the past is still the past, and cannot be changed.[9]
            The Three-Eyed Raven is with Bran when Bran is viewing the events that occurred at the Tower of Joy at the end of Robert's Rebellion. He identifies young Ned's second-in-command as Howland Reed, Meera's father, and also confirms that Ser Arthur Dayne is a better swordsman than Ned is, explaining to a confused Bran that there is a difference between history and what actually happened.
            Bran calls out to his future father in desperation â to his shock, Ned seems to hear him, but dismisses it and continues into the Tower. The Three-Eyed Raven pulls Bran out of the vision, and reprimands him again for trying to interact with the past. The Three-Eyed Raven says he's waited a thousand years for Bran, as the weirwood roots have grown into him. He assures Bran that he [Bran] is not destined to share his fate, but warns that he must learn before he leaves. When Bran demands to know what it is he needs to learn, the Three-Eyed Raven declares, "everything".[10]
            Eventually, he and Leaf decide that Bran is ready to learn the truth about the White Walkers. The Three-Eyed Raven accompanies Bran into a vision of the distant past, thousands of years ago, during the war between the Children and the First Men, in which they witness a group of Children led by Leaf approach a captured man, and magically insert a shard of Dragonglass into his heart, which transforms him into the first of the White Walkers. Awakening, Bran realizes that the White Walkers were created by the Children to use as weapons against his ancestors.[11]
            Later, whilst the Three-Eyed Raven and Bran's companions are resting, Bran interacts with one of the weirwood roots, triggering a vision in which he witnesses a large army of Wights, idly standing in the frozen wastes of the Land of Always Winter. Wading into their midst, Bran stares incredulously at the creatures, ultimately finding himself standing before the Night King himself, and three of his Lieutenants. Unlike the Wights, however, the Walkers take note of their guest. The Night King meets Bran's gaze, and materializes beside him, grabbing hold of his arm. Awakening in terror, the Three-Eyed Raven reveals to him that the Night King has marked him; he knows where he is, and will come for him. The mark likewise neutralizes the magic wards around the cave which bar the Walkers and their minions from entering. The Three-Eyed Raven tells him that he and his companions must leave.
            While Meera and Hodor pack their belongings and the children prepare the cave's defenses, the Three-Eyed Raven takes Bran into the past one final time, again to his father's childhood at Winterfell, this time witnessing the young Eddard departing for The Vale, as the castle's citizens look on, including Wylis and Old Nan. Soon, the Night King and his three Lieutenants arrive with an army of Wights to launch their attack on the cave. Though Leaf and the Children attempt to hold them off, their attempts are in vain, as the Walkers and their Wights breach the cave. Still within the vision, the Three-Eyed Raven remains motionless in the roots as the defenders are slaughtered, and Bran, Meera, Hodor, and Leaf make their escape through the back of the cave.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Three-eyed_raven</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascThreeEyedRaven</string></dict>

            Will is a ranger of the Night's Watch. He was not of noble birth, but was posthumously described by Benjen Stark as a reliable soldier, a "true ranger".
            A patrol consisting of Will, Gared and Ser Waymar Royce set out into the Haunted Forest beyond the Wall. Will is later found hundreds of miles south of the Wall near Winterfell, apparently having gone renegade. He is apprehended and brought before Lord Eddard Stark for justice. Will claims that his companions have been brutally killed by the White Walkers and he fled in terror. Eddard does not believe the story and executes Will as a deserter, beheading him with his Valyrian steel greatsword, Ice.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Will is famed for his skills as a tracker and a hunter, a result of his previous career as a poacher. Nobody can move more silent through the forrest than Will. After being caught killing a Mallister buck by Lord Jason Mallister's woodsmen, he chose to take the black over losing a hand. He has been at the Wall for four years when the events of the books begin.

            Prince Trystane is a member of House Martell, the ruling house of Dorne. He is the only son of Prince Doran Martell, Lord of Sunspear and Prince of Dorne. Like his father Doran, Trystane lacks (for the most part) the hotheadedness typical of Dornishmen, as evidenced by his showing mercy to Bronn for attacking him.
            Trystane is proposed as a potential marriage candidate for Princess Myrcella Baratheon by her uncle, Hand of the King Tyrion Lannister.[1] The alliance with the Prince of Dorne is accepted and Myrcella is sent to Dorne as a ward of House Martell.[2]
            Trystane is briefly seen walking and flirting with his betrothed Myrcella Baratheon in the Water Gardens during the argument between Ellaria Sand and Prince Doran Martell.[3]
            When Jaime Lannister and Bronn enter the Water Gardens, Trystane is again taking a walk with Myrcella, with Trystane suggesting they should ask Doran to have them married the next day. Myrcella asks if he only wants to marry her because they are both from Great Houses, but Trystane cuts her off with a passionate kiss. Doran, observing the happy couple, muses to Areo Hotah that they don't realize how much danger they are in and that they must be protected.
            While kissing Myrcella, Trystane encounters Bronn and Jaime in the Gardens. Although he introduces himself courteously enough, he is clearly suspicious, having heard no news of Jaime's visit to Dorne; his suspicions are aroused further when he sees bloodstains on the stolen robes Jaime and Bronn are wearing. Although Bronn cautions him not to do something stupid, Trystane reaches for his sword, forcing Bronn to knock him out, to Myrcella's distress. Jaime then attempts to take Myrcella out of the palace, but he and Bronn are then attacked by Trystane's cousins, the Sand Snakes. The skirmish ends when all five of the intruders are arrested by Areo Hotah and his guards.
            Doran invites Trystane, Myrcella, Ellaria and Jaime to drinking and eat with him. There, he promises Jaime that he does not want a war with the Lannisters and that he will send Myrcella back to King's Landing. However, Trystane and Myrcella's betrothal is to stand, which means Trystane will accompany his betrothed to the capital. He will also take up Oberyn's vacant seat on the Small Council, to further cement the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne. Jaime accepts these terms.
            Jaime then brings up the matter of Bronn, who is still imprisoned as a result of his aggression on the prince. Doran defers to Trystane to decide, as he must learn how to punish lawbreakers if he must one day rule. Trystane agrees to let Bronn go on one condition: he will receive the same thing that he inflicted upon him. This meets with his father's approval and Bronn is brought before them and Areo elbows him hard across the face. Trystane later accompanies Jaime, Myrcella and Bronn to the harbor of Sunspear, where he remains silent, as the others say farewell to Prince Doran and Ellaria. However, Trystane's life is put in danger when Ellaria and the Sand Snakes secretly poison Myrcella.Â [4]
            To ensure Trystane's safety and avoid a conflict with Dorne, Jaime leaves him on board the ship once they reach King's Landing. As Trystane paints the eye stones for Myrcella's funeral, he is approached by Obara and Nymeria, having stowed away on the ship and sent to kill him by Ellaria, who has herself murdered Doran back in Dorne. Trystane attempts to reason with his cousins that they are family, but they merely laugh it off. He is given a choice to fight Obara or Nymeria. Though he draws his sword and prepares to fight Nymeria, as she is armed with only a whip, he is stabbed through the back of the head by Obara and killed instantly, much to Nymeria's chagrin.[5]
            A small justice is enacted for Trystane when Obara and Nymeria are slain by Euron Greyjoy.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Prince Trystane is the youngest son of Prince Doran Martell, the ruler of Dorne, and third in the Martell line of succession. He is the younger brother of Arianne and Quentyn Martell. He has olive skin and straight black hair. He is two years older than Myrcella Baratheon, making him about 12 years old when they are betrothed.
            In the novels, Trystane and Myrcella get along well, but never declare their love nor kiss.
            Trystane does not participate, and perhaps has no idea of his sister Arianne's plan to crown Myrcella. The plan is foiled as Areo Hotah intercepts Arianne's party. During the commotion, one of Arianne's escorts, Ser Gerold "Darkstar" Dayne, slashes at Myrcella. Unlike in the show, Myrcella survives but is terribly disfigured. It is unknown how Trystane reacted when he heard about that.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Trystane_Martell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTrystaneMartell</string></dict>

            Wallen is a former member of the Night's Watch, who abandoned the Wall to live amongst the wildlings.
            Stiv, Osha and Wallen flee south of the Wall, apparently in fear of the return of the White Walkers. In the woods near Winterfell they stumble across Bran Stark and decide to steal his horse. Realizing his importance, they ponder taking him prisoner and returning him to Mance Rayder, the king-beyond-the-wall, for a reward, but decide against it. Robb Stark intervenes and kills Wallen and disables Osha. Stiv is killed by Theon Greyjoy.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Wallen is a member of a band of wildlings who manage to evade the Watch to seek succor in the lands to the south. He is an associate of Osha and Stiv.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Wallen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWallen</string></dict>
        <key>Willem Darry</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.89.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Willem Darry âwasÂ a knight of House Darry who remained loyal to House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion.
            Following the Sack of King's Landing and the birth of Daenerys Targaryen, Ser Willem smuggled Viserys and Daenerys across the Narrow Sea to the Free Cities before Stannis Baratheon arrived to seize Dragonstone.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Willem Darry was the master-at-arms at the Red Keep and the brother of Ser Jonothor Darry of the Kingsguard. He was a grey bear of a man who was half-blind. He had a gruff, kind voice and big wrinkled hands, soft as old leather.
            After the Mad King's death in the Sack of King's Landing and Queen Rhaella's death during labor, the garrison of Dragonstone considered selling Viserys and the infant Daenerys to the new king. However, before they could come to a decision, Ser Willem and four loyal men smuggled Viserys and Daenerys from the island and fled to safety in Braavos. However, Ser Willem was old and some years later he became sick and died, leaving Viserys and Daenerys to fend for themselves.
            In "A Feast for Crows" and "A Dance with Dragons," it is revealed SerÂ WillemÂ and Doran Martell signed a secret pact of alliance between Dorne and House Targaryen in Braavos. The alliance was to be sealed by a marriage between ViserysÂ and PrincessÂ Arianne Martell. Ser Willem never told Viserys (nor Daenerys) about the pact. Viserys died unaware, and Daenerys only learns of it many years later when Quentyn Martell arrives at her court in Meereen to propose a marriage between the two of them, given that Viserys is dead.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Willem_Darry</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWillemDarry</string></dict>
        <key>Waldron Frey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.90.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Waldron Frey was one of the many sons of Walder Frey and was formerly betrothed to Arya Stark, who later murdered his father and then, possibly, Waldron himself.[1]
            When Catelyn Stark negotiates with Walder Frey to gain permission for her son Robb Stark and his army to pass the Twins, Walder demands that Arya Stark will marry his son Waldron. Catelyn and Robb accept his terms.[2]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Arya is betrothed to Elmar Frey. The character has been renamed for the television series. Elmar is the twenty-second son of Lord Walder Frey and the fourth born to Lord Walder's seventh wife, Annara Farring. Elmar is the older brother of Shirei Frey, the youngest child that Lord Walder had with Annara Farring. He is nine years old.
            Elmar encounters Arya several times in Harrenhal and tries to boss her around, while mentioning proudly that he is trueborn son of lord Walder Frey and is going to marry a princess - both of them are unaware that Arya is that princess. Arya is not impressed and does not comply to him. After being informed that Robb Stark breached the pact with the Freys, Elmar tells Arya whiningly that his father told him he had to marry someone else, or to become a septon. Arya has no sympathy to him.
            Elmar appears briefly in the third novel, serving as the cupbearer when Roose Bolton hosts Jaime andÂ Brienne at Harrenhal. Roose tells them that Elmar was to wed Arya Stark, but Lord Frey had no choice but to break the betrothal when Robb betrayed him.
            Elmar does not appear in the novels afterwards.
            In the german dub of the TV series the name Elmar was used instead Waldron!</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Waldron_Frey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWaldronFrey</string></dict>
        <key>Wolkan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.91.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wolkan is a member of the Order of Maesters, and was in service to House Bolton at the Dreadfort and then Winterfell. He now serves House Stark following the Battle of the Bastards.
            At dinner, Lord Roose Bolton reveals to his family that Lady Walda is pregnant, and that Maester Wolkan believes the child is a boy.[1]
            Wolkan listens as Ramsay recalls his initial interaction with Myranda. Wolkan asks Ramsay whether to bury her body or burn it on a pyre. Ramsay tells him to feed it to the hounds.[2]
            Wolkan later informs Roose of Lady Walda's birthing of a boy, and subsequently witnesses Ramsay kill Roose, his own father. Terrified by what has happened, Wolkan obeys Ramsay's order to inform the Northern houses that Roose was poisoned by the Boltons' enemies. Ramsay then instructs Wolkan to bring Walda and the baby to him. Wolkan tells Ramsay that Walda is resting, his own way of subtly pleading for their lives, but Ramsay's glare scares Wolkan into obeying.[3]
            Following Ramsay's defeat by Jon Snow in the Battle of the Bastards, Wolkan now serves House Stark, replacing the deceased Luwin, under Jon as the new King in the North. He delivers a message to Jon from Queen Cersei Lannister, addressing him respectfully as "Your Grace".[4] He later hands Jon another message, this one from Samwell Tarly from the Citadel in Oldtown.[5]
            After Jon leaves for Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys Targaryen, leaving Sansa Stark in charge, Wolkan discusses Winterfell's food rations with Sansa, Petyr Baelish and Lord Yohn Royce, agreeing with Sansa that there is currently not enough food to feed the North if the battle against the Night King starts soon. Wolkan promises to refer to Maester Luwin's notes regarding the longest winter in the past century and to obtain more food for the North.[6]
            Wolkan later builds a wheelchair for the returned Bran Stark, so that he can move around Winterfell more easily. Meera then asks about it, claiming it as a good idea.[7] After Bran experiences a vision of the army of the dead and the White Walkers marching towards Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Bran tells Maester Wolkan to send ravens throughout Westeros warning of the threat. Later, Arya Stark eavesdrops on Wolkan and Petyr talking about the "only copy" of a letter, which turns out to be a missive that Sansa wrote under duress to her brother Robb Stark calling on him to bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon in an attempt to save their father Eddard Stark's life.[8]
            Wolkan is shown to be a peaceful man who abhors violence, shown when he is visibly shocked at Ramsay murdering his own father in cold blood, and doing his best to plead for Walda and her baby's lives when he knows what Ramsay intends to do to them. Also, despite her vicious and sadistic nature, Wolkan appears saddened at Myranda's death and even more so when Ramsay instructs him to feed Myranda's body to the dogs instead of cremating or burying her with dignity, even though Myranda had no dignity to speak of in the first place. This appears to be due to Wolkan's training as a maester, to generally help people instead of harming them in contrast to the likes of Myranda, Locke and the Master Torturer. With Ramsay now gone, however, Wolkan appears much more comfortable serving Jon Snow and House Stark.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character named Wolkan. Lord Roose Bolton brought three maesters to Winterfell to be put in charge of the ravens and messages, not to look after Walda. They were Maester Henly from Blackpool, Maester Medrick from Hornwood and Maester Rhodry from Castle Cerwyn. In the sixth season, Roose refers to "the maesters", indicating that Wolkan is not the only maester who serves the Boltons in Winterfell, but since Wolkan is the only one shown or named personally, it is possible that he is the head maester.
            Maester Wolkan is apparently named after one of the TV series's co-producers, Annick Wolkan.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Wolkan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWolkan</string></dict>

            Ser Willis Wode is sworn to the service of House Whent of Harrenhal, a vassal house to House Tully. He is traveling the Kingsroad following the Tourney of the Hand. He carries a shield emblazoned with the black bat of Harrenhal.
            Willis is drinking with another man at the Inn at the Crossroads when Tyrion Lannister arrives on his way south. Catelyn Stark is also in the inn and Tyrion recognizes her. She turns to the men of her father's bannermen to help her to take Tyrion into custody, accusing him of attempting to murder her son, Bran Stark. Catelyn announces that she will return Tyrion to Winterfell to await the King's justice. Ser Willis draws his sword and threatens Tyrion.[1]
            He accompanies Catelyn east into the Vale of Arryn, her actual destination. Among the party are the captive Tyrion, the two Lannister men-at-arms who were traveling with Tyrion, Catelyn and her escort Ser Rodrik Cassel, the sellsword Bronn, the singer Marillion, a man of House Bracken and six other swordsmen loyal to House Tully.

        <key>Tommen Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.96.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Tommen I Baratheon was the younger brother of King Joffrey and Princess Myrcella. Though legally the son of the late KingÂ Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, his true father is Ser Jaime Lannister, the Queen's twin brother. His sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins.
            After his brother's death during his wedding to Margaery Tyrell, Tommen assumed the throne under the name of Tommen of the House Baratheon, the First of His Name. After witnessing the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor and learning of the death of his beloved Queen among all the casualites, Tommen committed suicide by jumping out of a window in the Red Keep.
            He has an older brother, Joffrey, and an older sister Myrcella with the same obfuscated parentage. Tommen is good-natured and passive in contrast to his brother Joffrey, who sometimes bullied Tommen for amusement.[3] Like his sister, he is fond of his uncle Tyrion Lannister.[4]
            Tommen accompanies his family north to Winterfell.[5] Tommen is eating breakfast with his mother, father and sister as his uncle Tyrion approaches.
            He giggles as his uncle lifts him aside to join them. His sister asks whether Bran Stark will die and Tyrion replies that he is expected to live, much to Myrcellaâs delight and Cerseiâs horror. Tyrion goes on to say how he wishes to see the Wall and witness the âwintry abode of the white walkers,â exciting Myrcella and Tommen. He then says he wants to urinate off the edge of it, a comment which causes both his niece and nephew to laugh. Cersei is irritated by his words and leaves, calling the children to her.[6]
            Tommen attends the tournament to celebrate Eddard Stark becoming Hand of the King, during which he and the crowd bear witness to Gregor Clegane killing his opponent in an apparent and very gruesome accident and then behead his own stallion in a rage, both of which causes the young prince to leap out of his chair in horror.[7][8]
            Tommen attends Joffrey's nameday tournament. He is pleased when his uncle Tyrion Lannister arrives during the festivities and tells him that one day he will be as big as the Hound "but much better looking".[9].
            Tommen attends a dinner with Myrcella, his mother and Sansa Stark. He asks whether Robb will be killed after the war, and says that he wouldn't like that.[10]
            Myrcella is sent to Dorne as part of a marriage pact with House Martell. Tommen watches her departure from the harbor, sobbing. Joffrey mocks him for crying, though Sansa stands up for him. As they return to the Red Keep, Tyrion senses the unrest of the smallfolk and orders Tommen sent along a separate route, narrowly avoiding the Riot of King's Landing.[11]
            She is stopped just in time when Tywin Lannister arrives to announce their victory.[12]
            Tommen is present at Joffrey's wedding ceremony to Margaery Tyrell, and during the subsequent feast. Initially, he laughed at his brother's crude play of dwarves reenacting the War of the Five Kings, but stopped after noticing the look on his uncle Tyrion's face. After Joffrey's poisoning and subsequent death, Tommen inherits the crown and is now the king and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.[13]
            Tommen later stands vigil with Cersei over Joffrey's corpse in the Great Sept of Baelor. Tywin, in an unusually agreeable mood, enters and proceeds to quiz Tommen on the traits that make a good king, ignoring Cersei's protests and angry glares. Tommen suggests holiness, justice, and strength as qualities of a good king, but Tywin refutes these answers by pointing out that Kings Baelor, Orys, and Robert were each paragons of one of these qualities, but ultimately not very good kings. Tywin is delighted when Tommen, with minimal prompting, deduces that a good king must be wise. Tywin tells Tommen that young kings with no experience can become wise by listening to their councilors, and the wisest kings keep listening even when they don't need to anymore. After admitting that Joffrey was neither good nor wise, Tywin escorts Tommen out of the Sept and begins teaching him the duties of a king's marriage. On their way out, Jaime passes them and asks how Tommen is doing; the young king replies that he is all right, and Jaime assures Tommen that he will not let him meet the same end as his brother.[14]
            In response to Joffrey's death, Cersei insists that Tommen be placed under high guard, with at least four Kingsguard at his bedroom door at night, something Jaime finds a bit excessive. Tommen has been moved to Joffrey's bedchamber and has yet to redecorate; hence, he has difficulty sleeping with Joffrey's gruesome hunting trophies all around. That night Margaery sneaks into Tommen's chambers. She suggests that they get to know one another before their marriage, something nobles in Westeros don't usually do. Tommen is unnerved by her presence until his cat, Ser Pounce, jumps up and Margaery interacts with him. Tommen sullenly reveals the cruel things Joffrey threatened to do to Ser Pounce, and he and Margaery bond over their mutual relief that they are free of him. Tommen agrees that he'd like Margaery to visit him again. Margaery departs, but not before giving a kiss on the forehead.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tommen_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTommenBaratheon</string></dict>
        <key>Tormund</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.97.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tormund, often called Tormund Giantsbane, is a renowned leader and raider among the Free Folk and one of the key leaders behind Mance Rayder. Tormund respected Mance as the King-Beyond-the-Wall and suspected he was the man to lead them through the Long Night. But as time passes and Mance is killed on the orders of Stannis Baratheon, he believes the prophesied warrior is his enemy-turned-friend Jon Snow.
            Tormund is a trusted leader in his own right of a large warband of wildlings. He has joined his forces to those of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder, and now functions as one of Mance's most trusted lieutenants. Tormund is not just a capable leader, but also a very dangerous fighter. This is proven during the Battle of Castle Black, where he killed multiple Night's Watch brothers and clearly outmatched Ser Alliser Thorne in single combat.
            He boasts of having bedded a she-bear, which he calls Shella. Ygritte insists that everyone knows he just made this story up. Tormund makes much of his capacity for drink and sexual encounters, usually as a means of raising his allies' morale. He is extremely loyal to those who have fought alongside him, even Jon Snow, who once betrayed him and the wildlings.
            Tormund has two daughters, though he hasn't mentioned if he has any sons.[1]
            When Jon Snow is taken to Mance Rayder's tent, he initially believes Tormund is Mance and kneels before him. Tormund is amused though Mance's suspicions of Jon makesÂ Tormund wary.[2]
            As Mance's army marches away from the Frostfangs, Tormund, alongside Ygritte, accompanies Orell as Orell performs scouting duties by warging into his eagle.[2]
            Tormund accompanies Mance, along with Orell, Ygritte and Jon Snow, to the Fist of the First Men, where they see the mutilated horse corpses left behind by the White Walkers after their attack against the Night's Watch. Mance commands Tormund to climb the Wall along with twenty raiders and Jon Snow, and wait for his signal to attack Castle Black from behind.[3]
            As Tormund's party comes closer to the Wall, Tormund questions Jon about the "crows" patrolling the top of the Wall spotted by Orell's eagle. Jon explains that the patrols are two Builders and two Rangers. Orell then questions Jon about the castles still manned by the Watch and the number of men in the garrison of Castle Black, disbelieving Jon's claim that a thousand men defend it. When Orell and Ygritte, who defends Jon, are about to start a fight, Tormund puts a stop to it throwing Orell away. Tormund tells Jon he likes him but will kill him nonetheless if he's lying. Jon remains adamant on his lie, but Tormund remains doubtful.[4]
            Tormund's party camps at a patch of the Haunted Forest that has been left unchecked and grown close to the Wall. Tormund comments to Jon that, once, crows would cut down any the trees within a mile of the Wall. When Jon asks Ygritte if she's ever climbed the Wall she confesses she hasn't, but Tormund has done it many times. After a few minutes, Tormund approaches Jon again and gives him a climbing pick. He advises Jon to sink it deep into the ice of the Wall and make sure it holds before taking the next step. He then jokes that if he falls, he better not scream because he wouldn't want that be the last thing Ygritte remembers about him.[5]
            Tormund's party breaks into four smaller groups to climb the Wall. Tormund leads one of them, with Orell, Yrgitte, and Jon sharing the same rope. Tormund's pick breaks a piece of ice that causes Jon to briefly lose his footing. The Wildling leader jokes that he wanted to see if he could take a hit. The raiding party climb further, but a portion of the Wall breaks down, taking one of the groups to their deaths. The ice keeps breaking and Tormund nails his pick hard to prevent them from falling, but Ygritte and Jon do drop, and end up dangling in the air. Tormund holds the rope with one hand but Orell begins cutting the rope to prevent Jon and Ygritte from bringing them down. Jon reaches the ice just as Orell cuts Ygritte loose. Later, the group reaches an abandoned watchpost of the Night's Watch. Ygritte and Jon reach the top as Tormund gathers his rope.[5]
            Tormund and the raiding party climb down from the Wall and begin their march to take Castle Black unaware. Some time later, the party encamps in a forest area of the Gift. Tormund jokingly gives Jon some advice on how to properly have sex with a woman before ordering the group to begin the march again.[6]
            Some time afterward,Â Tormund's party reach the hut of a man who breeds horses for the Night's Watch. Orell advises attacking the man and killing him for his horses and gold. Tormund muses he may have good steel. Jon argues to spare the man and just take the horses, as the Watch will send less men to track down thieves than for a murderer. Tormund hopes for more men as it will be easier to kill them in the open than in Castle Black. Tormund orders his men to spread out to attack the hut. The man escapes after his horses react to a noise made by Jon to warn him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tormund</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTormund</string></dict>
        <key>Thoros</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.98.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Thoros, commonly known as Thoros of Myr, was a red priest of the Lord of Light and a noted warrior, fighting in the Greyjoy Rebellion. He was a leading member of the Brotherhood Without Banners and a good friend of the Brotherhood's leader, Lord Beric Dondarrion.
            Thoros was born in the Free City of Myr in Essos. Being an eighth son, Thoros' father had no means to support him and gave him up to the local Temple of the Lord of Light. There, he was raised to become a Red Priest, though he grew up a gluttonous and lustful man, constantly raiding the kitchens and taking girls to his chambers. He was tasked by the High Priest to turn future King Robert Baratheon away from the Seven and convert him to the Lord of Light.
            He was already present in the Red Keep by the time the bodies of Rhaenys and Aegon Targaryen were presented to Robert. Thoros became part of the court and a drinking and whoring companion of King Robert. He also became famous for using a sword coated with wildfire and set ablaze before combat as a way of intimidating his enemies.
            He fought for King Robert Baratheon in the Greyjoy Rebellion. He was the first man, followed closely byÂ Ser Jorah Mormont, through the breach during theÂ Siege of Pyke, stabbing and terrifying the ironborn with his flaming sword.[1]
            Jory Cassel and Jaime Lannister reminisce about the Siege of Pyke. Jory swears that he will remember Thoros charging through the breach with his blazing sword until his dying day. He joins Beric Dondarrion in order to help him track down Gregor Clegane on the orders of Eddard Stark.
            After they were ambushed by Clegane at the Mummer's Ford, the 40 men out of the hundred they had traveled with continued on as the Brotherhood Without Banners. After hearing of the deaths of Robert and Ned, he went back to serving his religion with the rest of the Brotherhood.
            Later, Sandor Clegane is captured by the Brotherhood, and he reveals the true identity of Arya to them. The Brotherhood tries to convict Sandor of crimes because of his long service to the Lannisters, but know of no evil Sandor had personally done to them.Â Arya speaks up, and accuses him of killing her friend Mycah. He is placed on trial by combatÂ by Beric Dondarrion. After Clegane kills Beric during the fight, Thoros quickly calls upon the Lord of Light to revive Beric, repeatedly chantingÂ "LORD cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished, restore it!", and in a few short seconds, Beric is alive and breathing again, his wounds healed as well.
            When she asks Thoros how many times he brought him back, he responds with six. Stunned, she claims that he should not have that kind of power, to which he simply remarks that he has no power, he only asks the Lord for favors, and the Lord responds. Thoros then confesses how he had always had a large lack of faith in the Lord of Light and never took his duties seriously because of them, until the day that Gregor Clegane killed Beric, his friend, and Thoros was called upon to revive him. When he saw that it worked, Thoros' faith was restored.Â Melisandre convinces Beric and Thoros to give her Gendry in exchange for gold, and because the Lord of Light requires him."[4]
            Arya Stark could not forgive Thoros and Beric for selling Gendry to Melisandre. Later, during her travels with Sandor Clegane, she includes their names when reciting her "death list".[5]
            While witnessing a sermon by a Red Priestess in Volantis, Tyrion remarks that she is much better looking than Thoros, who was the only red priest in King's Landing.[6]
            Thoros, along with the other members of the Brotherhood travel north, but end up staying at a hut which Sandor stopped in a few years ago with Arya. There, Thoros shows Sandor the power of R'hllor, asking him to look into the fire. The Hound witnesses a vision about the Wall, Wights and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Thoros later helps Sandor bury the previous residents of the hut, a Farmer and his daughter, Sally.[8]
            Thoros gets taken prisoner along with Beric and Sandor Clegane by the wildlings guarding the Eastwatch castle on behalf of the Night's Watch. After finding them in the cells where Thoros is recognized by Jorah Mormont, Jon Snow frees them to join the excursion team going north to capture a wight.[9] On the journey, Thoros questions whether Gendry is still upset with the Brotherhood selling him. Gendry reveals that Melisandre tried to kill him, which Thoros deduces was part of a ritual that needed Gendry's blood. When Gendry persists in his anger toward them, The Hound tells him that he's just needlessly complaining, and Thoros offers Gendry a drink, which he grudgingly accepts.
            Shortly after the group finally reaches the mountain peak the Hound had seen in the fire, one of the group's scouts sees a large figure in the distance, much larger than a human. When the creature charges after noticing, it is quickly revealed to be a wight snow bear, which makes short work of the scout. Beric and Thoros both light their blades aflame, and the entire group engages. In the course of fighting the beast, another in the group is killed, and Thoros is gravely injured by the bear when he tries to protect Sandor, receiving severe lacerations on his stomach and chest. Beric uses the fire on his sword to cauterize the wounds, while Thoros comments on how strange his life has become considering he was bitten by a dead bear. Thoros is helped to his feet and continues on, though weakened from his injuries.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Thoros</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascThoros</string></dict>
        <key>Timett</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.99.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Timett is the leader of the Burned Men and a renowned fearless warrior.
            Timett, son of Timett, is the leader of the Burned Men, one of the hill tribes living in the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon on the western edge of the Vale of Arryn. He is a large and fierce young man with only one eye. Despite his youth, his savagery and success in battle have seen him rise high amongst the hill tribes.
            Tyrion Lannister is captured by Shagga and the Stone Crows while traversing the Vale of Arryn. Tyrion offers an alliance to the Hill Tribes; fight the enemies of House Lannister in exchange for weapons, gold and autonomy from The Eyrie.[1] Timett agrees to the alliance and escorts Tyrion to the Lannister encampment in the Riverlands. They are joined by other clans including Chella and the Black Ears, the Moon Brothers and the Painted Dogs. Timett is presented to Lord Tywin Lannister by Tyrion. Tywin accepts the alliance and Shagga's insistence that they fight alongside Tyrion on the battlefield.[2] The Burned Men take part in the Lannister victory in the Battle of the Green Fork. They then engage in post-battle looting.[3]
            Timett and his men escort Tyrion to King's Landing where he becomes Acting Hand of the King on behalf of Tywin.[4]
            After Tyrion discovers that Grand Maester Pycelle is spying on him for Queen Cersei, Timett and Bronn accompany him to confront Pycelle. Tyrion orders Timett to cut off Pycelle's manhood and feed it to the goats. Timett points out that there are no goats nearby and Tyrion is exasperated. Tyrion settles for shortening his beard and confining him to the Black Cells.[5]
            * - Uncredited appearances
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Burned Men are noted as the most unpredictable and savage of the mountain clans, and Timett is the most feared of them. Normally Burned Men are expected to burn off a finger or nipple as a show of might during their rite of manhood, but Timett burned out an eye as a sign of bravery and might, which earned him great respect within his tribe and the title of Red Hand.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Timett</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTimett</string></dict>
        <key>Todder</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.100.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Todder, nicknamed Toad, is a Builder of the Night's Watch.
            Toad is present during the speech Lord Commander Jeor Mormont gave to the "graduating" recruits. He is assigned to the Builders.[1]
            He alerts other members of the Watch of Jon Snow's return.[2]
            Todder accompanies Jon Snow on his expedition to Hardhome. During the battle that ensues after the arrival of the Night King, he attempts to dissuade Jon from staying behind to fight off the White Walkers, but Jon orders him to keep transporting wildlings to the ships.[3] After the Night King summons a new host of wights, Toad pulls back to shore to allow Jon, Edd, Tormund and the last few fighters to jump aboard and escape the oncoming hoard and row away. Todder is then seen returning to Castle Black with Jon Snow, Eddison Tollett, Tormund and the rescued wildlings.
            Todder was first mentioned in Season 1's "You Win or You Die", but he didn't appear on-screen until Season 3's "Mhysa". Even then, the actor wasn't identified by name to be playing Todder until Season 5's "Hardhome".
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Todder is the son of a winesink owner. He is described as a short, ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. He has pig eyes, small and shiny. Instead of a Builder, Toad is made a Ranger. He's part of the group of friends that prevent Jon Snow from abandoning the Night's Watch when the latter flees to join Robb Stark on his march south to wage war against the Iron Throne.
            On "A Dance with Dragons", Toad complains about Melisandre's preaching, that she calls the Seven and the old gods false gods, and made the wildlings burn weirwood branches. Later, Jon sends him to serve at the Shadow Tower.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Todder</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTodder</string></dict>
        <key>Tycho Nestoris</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.101.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tycho Nestoris is a banker and an employee of the Iron Bank of Braavos, the largest financial institution in the world.
            Tycho Nestoris is a representative of the Iron Bank of Braavos. He is a rational man, more interested in numbers than in words, reasoning that the former are less likely to deceive than the latter.
            Shortly after Tommen Baratheon's coronation, Tycho and two of his colleagues receive Stannis Baratheon and his Hand, Ser Davos Seaworth, who ask them to fund their continuing campaign in Westeros. Tycho points out their weak position and is ready to dismiss them when Ser Davos speaks up, relating how he came into Stannis' service, how the latter is a just man who keeps his word, and how he is the best chance for the Iron Bank to get its money back upon the chaos that would follow the death of the elderly Tywin Lannister. This seems to convince the banker and his colleagues, as they agree to fund Stannis.[1]
            Tycho receives Mace Tyrell when the latter arrives in Braavos to renegotiate the kingdom's terms with the Iron Bank. Though polite, Tycho seems to dislike Tyrell, whose bumbleness clashes with Tycho's polite dignity. On the way to the bank, Mace offers him fine wines from the Arbor as a token of esteem but Tycho politely declines. After negotiating with Mace for some time, Tycho leads his guest outside to bid him farewell, but Mace keeps talking, stating that singing is a skill that anyone can learn. To prove that, he immediately starts singing a song, much to Tycho's disapproval.[2]
            After Cersei Lannister's coronation, Tycho is sent to Westeros in order to get back the money the Crown owes the Iron Bank. He meets with Cersei and the two discuss Cersei's position in the world and in the war against Daenerys Targaryen. During the conversation, Tycho admits that the Iron Bank had made strong profits in the slave trade which has now been destroyed by Daenerys. Cersei actually manages to convince Tycho to stay in King's Landing for a fortnight - promising that he will return to Braavos with her debt paid in full.[3]
            Tycho meets with Cersei for a second time, who compliments her for paying back much of her massive debts in a single payment, noting that he does not believe the Iron Bank has ever been paid back in such a manner. He flatters Cersei by telling her that she seems to be almost surpassing her father in this regard; Cersei thanks him for his kindness, addressing him as a lord, but Tycho points out he is neither kind nor a lord, but merely an employee of the Iron Bank. Tycho tells Cersei that some of his colleagues may be disappointed as they were interested in bringing up Cersei's interest rates. Nonetheless, he suggest that the Iron Bank may be able to invest in Cersei's venture to reestablish her control over the Seven Kingdoms. Cersei informs Tycho that her Hand, Qyburn, has reached out to the Golden Company, a powerful sellsword company in Essos. Tycho assures Cersei that they will support the Iron Throne - once they get their gold.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tycho Nestoris is described as a tall, stick of a man with long legs. He has a gaunt face with a thin rope of a beard growing from his chin which hangs down to his waist. He wears expensive robes of a sober dark purple color, trimmed with ermine fur. He is not introduced until the fifth novel, A Dance with Dragons.
            Tycho Nestoris travels to Eastwatch-by-the-SeaÂ with three ships and then travels toÂ Castle BlackÂ with QueenÂ Selyse and Shireen to meet Stannis, whom he does not know has already left.Â While he is at the Wall, Tycho meets Jon Snow, whoÂ negotiates with him for a loan to purchase food for the winter. He also borrows Tycho's ships for the mission he assigned Cotter Pyke - bringing the wildlings from Hardhome.
            Shortly afterwards, Alys Karstark (the daughter of Rickard Karstark) arrives and tells Jon that her great-uncle Arnolf, the castellan of Karhold, pretends to be Stannis's ally but collaborates with the Boltons. Jon immediately sends Tycho with guides to find Stannis and warn him of the traitor in his host.
            Tycho and his escorts travel light, therefore they make it to Winterfell faster than Stannis's host (which still camps in an abandonedÂ crofters' village, three days away from the castle). Beneath the walls of Winterfell Tycho meets Mors Umber and his men, who have found Theon and Jeyne Poole. Mors hands them to Tycho, and they go to the village. Asha and Ser Clayton Suggs are the first to notice them.Â Asha finds it very absurd, to meet a Braavosi banker on such circumstances.
            In a sample chapter from The Winds of Winter, Stannis and Tycho reach an agreement. Stannis makes plans to send Tycho back to Castle Black, alongside Asha, to ensure his safety under Jon's watch. He assigns Ser Justin Massey and Alysane Mormont to escort them; after they reach Castle Black, Ser Justin will accompany Tycho on his way back to Braavos, where he will collect the money from the bank and hire ships and sellswords.
            With regards to Stannis visiting the Iron Bank of Braavos, the series producers stated that they thought it was important to physically introduce Tycho earlier instead of later. One of Bryan Cogman's initial ideas for "The Laws of Gods and Men" was to have Tycho come to Dragonstone to treat with Stannis, not the other way around: this was also changed to have Stannis visit Braavos, because they realized it was also important to physically introduce the city of Braavos and the Iron Bank itself as soon as possible. Cogman also felt that it made more dramatic sense for Stannis to have to come to Braavos to essentially beg for money, because at the moment he is losing the war, so logically the Iron Bank doesn't think he is significant enough anymore to go through the bother of sending an envoy to meet with him in person. As a result, Tycho's scenes in Season 4 have no direct counterpart in the third novel, though they are a condensation of running subplots involving the Iron Bank which are discussed at council meetings, and thus Tycho does not travel to Castle Black and has not interacted with Jon Snow. Tycho's return in the seventh season represents a complete 180 from his actions in the books, working with Cersei of all people. Since the series has moved past Stannis's defeat, its possible that the Iron Bank will reevaluate its preferred candidate in the books as well as the series.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tycho_Nestoris</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTychoNestoris</string></dict>
        <key>Tobho Mott</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.102.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tobho Mott is a master armorer and blacksmith in King's Landing. His apprentice Gendry is a bastard son of Robert Baratheon. Tobho is tortured by the City Watch to reveal that Gendry fled the city in the wake of Robert's death.
            Tobho Mott is a master armorer and blacksmith living in the city of King's Landing. Despite being a foreigner from the Free City of Qohor, he is well-regarded for the quality of his work and has received the patronage of many knights and even some lords. Mott is assisted by his apprentice smith, a young man named Gendry.
            Eddard Stark learns that his predecessor Jon Arryn visited Mott prior to his death. Stark goes to question Mott and learns that Arryn displayed a particular interest in Gendry.[1] Stark later realizes that Gendry is the bastard son of King Robert Baratheon. Robert is killed and Gendry sets off to join the Night's Watch.[2]
            Mott is forcibly questioned and tortured by the Gold Cloaks about the whereabouts of Gendry. He reluctantly tells Janos Slynt that Gendry joined the Night's Watch and that he can be recognized by the bull-shaped helm he sports.[3]
            When Gendry mentions to the Brotherhood Without Banners that he apprenticed under Tobho, ThorosÂ noted that Tobho charges double what the other smiths do. Gendry retorts this by saying it is because his work is twice the quality.[4] Later, Gendry says he is done serving men, because Tobho sold him to the Night's Watch - apparently unaware that he was made to leave for the Wall to avoid the upcoming purge of Robert's other bastard children.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tobho Mott is a native of the Free City of Qohor who learned to smith there, including the working of the fabled Valyrian steel. He moved to Westeros when younger and has successfully built up his own business thanks to his formidable skills. His armory is a large building at the top of the Street of Steel, impressive in size and outfittings.
            When Eddard Stark asked Mott who paid him Gendry's apprentice fee, Mott answered evasively, but eventually admitted it was a mysterious lord who did not identify himself that paid him both the apprentice fee and to keep his mouth shut about the youth.
            In the books, Mott is not interrogated about Gendry's whereabouts. It is not explained how the Gold Cloaks knew that Gendry was with Yoren's caravan.
            Mott, not a smith from Volantis, is the one who melts Ice to forge two new swords at Tywin Lannister's order.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tobho_Mott</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTobhoMott</string></dict>

            Without the Valyrians and their dragons to keep them in check, the Dothraki swept across Essos. During this time Temmo commanded a khalasar numbering in the tens of thousands.
            Temmo was finally stopped, however, by a force of 3,000 Unsullied warrior-eunuchs during the Battle of Qohor. The Dothraki could easily have outflanked the Unsullied, but by tradition they scorn infantry, and thinking of them as easily ridden down. On this occasion, however, the lockstep phalanxes of the Unsullied held firm, and fearlessly resisted his khalasar's assaults. By the end of the battle only 600 Unsullied remained, but 12,000 Dothraki had been killed, including Temmo and his sons. Defeated, the surviving Dothraki cut off their braids and threw them at the feet of the Unsullied, to mark their shame, and departed.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Temmo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTemmo</string></dict>

            Ternesio Terys is the captain of the Titan's Daughter, a trading galleon from Braavos.
            Arya Stark approaches Terys at a small port in Saltpans and asks him if he'll give her passage to the Wall. She is willing to pay or scrub the floors of the ship in return. He tries to dissuade her from visiting the North, opining that it is a land of "ice, war and pirates". Besides, he says his ship is actually bound for his home, Braavos. Arya remembers the iron coin and the instructions that Jaqen H'ghar had given her following her escape from Harrenhal, and shows the coin to him, whispering "Valar Morghulis". Terys, astounded, responds with "Valar Dohaeris" and promises her a cabin.[1]
            After a long sea voyage, Ternesio and Arya Stark arrive at the city of Braavos. She is awestrack by the Titan, so he tells her that, in the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the Titan would wake and protect the city. Arya replies it's just a statue, and just then the Titan lets out a loud blast announcing their arrival, startling her, so the captain laughs. Terys personally brings Arya to the House of Black and White, where he claims she may find the man she seeks. Arya thanks Terys for bringing her this far and he responds that any man of Braavos would have done the same. They say their goodbyes, and he rows away.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ternesio Terys is also the captain of the Titan's Daughter. He keeps his grey hair cut short and neat and has a square windburnt face.

            Ser Terrence Toyne was fed to the dogs of King Aegon IV Targaryen for sleeping with one of his mistresses.[1]
            Terrence Toyne is mentioned within the entry of Aemon the Dragonknight in the The Book of Brothers. It is said that he was defeated by the Targaryen prince in the final joust in a tourney at Riverrun.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Terrence Toyne was once found abed with Bethany Bracken, one of King Aegon the Unworthy's mistresses. Even though they proclaimed love, Aegon had them executed. Toyne was dismembered piece by piece, while the mistress was forced to watch before meeting her own death. Ser Terrence's brothers attempted to avenge him by killing King Aegon, but were stopped by Prince Aemon the Dragonknight who died defending him instead. They paid for their treason with their lives and in turn this event was key in the downfall of House Toyne, which in a few generations devolved into a family of rogues and robber knights, whereas others went into exile across the Narrow Sea.

            Following his father's failed rebellion against the Iron Throne, Theon is taken as a hostage/ward to Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell. After Eddard's execution in King's Landing, Theon pledges his loyalty to Eddard's eldest son, Robb Stark, in the subsequent War of the Five Kings, but ultimately betrays Robb and sides with his father in invading the North, which leads to his capture by House Bolton. He is tortured and forced into servitude by Ramsay Snow, who turns him into a broken pet named Reek. Theon, however, redeems himself by helping Ramsay's wife, Sansa Stark, escape from Winterfell and find refuge with Jon Snow, who later retakes Winterfell and defeats Ramsay. Slowly returning to his former self, Theon returns to the Iron Islands, where he learns of his father's death at the hands of his own uncle, Euron Greyjoy. In retaliation, Theon flees with Yara to seek out an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen in Meereen, where they pledge House Greyjoy's forces to her. Despite abandoning Yara during the assault on the Targaryen Fleet, her later appeals to Daenerys' forces to retrieve her from Euron's custody.
            Theon is the youngest son of Lord Balon and Lady Alannys Greyjoy. Balon is the head of House Greyjoy and Lord of the Iron Islands. The Iron Islands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Greyjoy is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Greyjoy rule the region from their seat at Pyke and Balon also holds the title Lord Reaper of Pyke.
            Theon was born at Pyke. He is Balon and Alannys's fourth child after Rodrik, Maron, and Yara. Eight years before the start of the series Balon rose in rebellion against the Iron Throne. The ironborn were crushed in a war led by King Robert Baratheon and Lord Eddard Stark. Theon's brothers were both killed in the fighting. Balon surrendered and was allowed to remain Lord of the Iron Islands on the condition that Theon remain a hostage and ward of Eddard Stark.[2] Theon's sister Yara remained on the Iron Islands.[3] Despite his status as a hostage at Winterfell, Theon was treated well by the Starks, and he came to see Eddard as a surrogate father, while becoming best friends with Robb Stark and forming a friendly rivalry with Jon Snow. Theon is a skilled archer. His cocky arrogance and cavalier actions contrast with the staid ways of the North.[4]
            Theon is present during the execution of Will, a deserter from the Night's Watch. He holds the scabbard of Ice, the greatsword of House Stark, as Lord Eddard Stark draws it to behead the condemned man. On the way back to Winterfell, the party finds a disemboweled stag dead in the road. Looking for the killer, they find a dead female direwolf and five pups huddled by the corpse for warmth. A broken piece of the dead stag's antler is embedded in the direwolf's neck. Eddard initially insists the pups be given a quick death, which Theon cavalierly moves to carry out himself, upsetting Bran and angering Robb. However, Jon Snow tells his father that this is an omen as there are five pups and five Stark children. Eddard consents to allowing his children to adopt the pups. Just as the party leaves, Jon finds a sixth pup, an albino. Theon mockingly declares him the runt of the litter and that he belongs to Jon. Later, Robb, Jon, and Theon get shaves and haircuts, as they ponder the impending arrival of the royal party, notably the reputation of Queen Cersei Lannister as a great beauty and the poor reputation of Prince Joffrey Baratheon.[5]
            After the royal party's departure, an assassin attempts to kill Bran, who had fallen during one of his climbs and remained comatose. Theon learns that Catelyn has found evidence implicating the Lannisters in Bran's 'accident' and the failed assassination. Theon and Robb suggest taking revenge through military action, but Maester Luwin counsels patience. Catelyn and Ser Rodrik Cassel depart for King's Landing, leaving Robb in command of the castle.[6] Theon is present when Robb frostily receives Tyrion Lannister on his way back from the Wall. Afterwards, as Tyrion is leaving to stay in a brothel, Theon condescendingly tells him to ask for Ros. Tyrion ridicules Theon for his family's failed uprising, calling it "a stupid rebellion", and ponders how Balon Greyjoy would feel about his last living son being the Starks' "lackey".[7] While boasting about his family's exploits and heritage, he is put down by Maester Luwin. He reacts angrily to a further insult from his favorite prostitute, Ros, after sneaking her into the castle to engage her services.[8]
            Theon and Robb exchange views over the matter of Jory Cassel's death and the growing Stark-Lannister animosity in King's Landing. Robb brusquely reminds Theon that he is not a Stark. Bran is taken prisoner by wildlings in the forest near Winterfell and Theon saves him by shooting Stiv, the wildling leader, in the back with an arrow. Robb is angry at him, as Bran could have been hurt. Theon counters that he just saved Bran's life, and Robb was too hesitant to kill. Taking pride in his action, Theon says that you're "only considered a real man in the Iron Islands once you've killed your first enemy."[9] With the departure of Ros for King's Landing, Theon is left at the castle and is bored. He accosts the surviving wildling prisoner, the spearwife Osha, as she is now a servant at Winterfell. Theon throws his weight around, insisting that she call him "my lord", even though his father still holds the title. He is warned off by Maester Luwin who reminds Theon that he of all people should know that being a guest and a prisoner are not necessarily mutually exclusive.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascTheonGreyjoy</string></dict>

            TazalÂ first appears at the tavern Asher and BeskhaÂ are occupying in Yunkai, leading a group of Lost Legion fighters and claiming to be collecting the pair's hostage, Bezzaq. He initially offers them 400 Gold Dragons for the man, halving the offer Asher was originally given and outraging him. He then slits Bezzaq's throat and orders his men to attack the pair, planning to claim that they murdered Bezzaq and he was there to deal swift justice. However, Asher and BeskhaÂ manage to defeat Tazal's men and severely injure him, cutting off his right hand in the process.
            Asher then is given the option to snap his neck or spare him and just break his knee.
            If Asher spared Tâazal, the sellsword is later seen while he, Beskha, and Malcolm are attempting to escape Yunkai, being helped by fellow Lost Legion members and ordering that the fugitives must not be allowed to leave the city.
            If the player does not make a choice whether or not to spare Tazal, Beskha will stab him through the heart.
            Tazal is mentioned by Beskha if you killed him, mentioning the Lost Legion are still raw about him. Malcolm criticizes snapping his neck, believing it was overdoing it.
            If you busted Tazal's knee, Beskha will criticize you for not killing him, mentioning men like him do not forgive, and that Asher cut off his hand too.

        <key>Sam</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.109.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Samwell, better known as Sam and affectionately as Little Sam, is the son ofÂ Craster, a wildling who married his daughters, and Gilly, one of his many daughter-wives, hence making Sam a product of incest. He was named afterÂ Samwell Tarly, who saved the lives of Gilly and her son. Later, Samwell secretly adopted Sam, presenting the boy to his family, House Tarly, as his own bastard son and of Tarly blood, though he has not been officially "acknowledged".
            Two of Craster's wives deliver Gilly's baby in a birthing hut.Â At the same time the Night's Watch survivors of the Battle of the Fist of the First Men take shelter at Craster's Keep. After Gilly and Samwell Tarly notice that her new baby is a boy, they realize that Craster will want to sacrifice him to the White Walkers.[1]
            Sam visits Gilly, who is deeply distraught about the impending fate of her newborn son. She is frantic, and yells at Sam not to draw attention to his gender, as Craster will want to offer it up as a sacrifice when he finds out. He asks her if she has decided on a name, but she responds that there is no point in naming her baby if he is only going to be offered up as a human sacrifice. She gives Sam back his mother's thimble and says she doesn't care about such stupid things, and is focused only on protecting the life of her baby.
            When a mutiny breaks out that results in the deaths of Craster and Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, Sam rushes to Gilly's hut and tells her that they must leave. Sam runs out of Craster's Keep with Gilly and her baby, as loyal Night's Watch members fall to the mutineers, who also kill or rape Craster's other wives. Gilly leads the way into the night because she knows the woods around her home.[2]
            After several days of travelling, Sam, Gilly, and her baby arrived at an abandoned cabin in a forest. After lighting a fire, Sam suggests that Gilly name her son but she does not know any boy names. Sam gives her some examples, and also explains the difference between first and last names. They are interrupted by the squawks of several crows outside. When Sam and Gilly, who is carrying the baby, went out to investigate, they saw hundreds of crows squawking angrily at them. Shortly later, Gilly witnesses a White Walker approaching and realized that the creature has come for the baby due to Craster's habit of sacrificing male babies to these creatures. Sam manages to kill the White Walker with a dragonglass dagger. The three of them then flee into the night.[3]
            Following their encounter with the White Walker, Sam's mother Gilly and her protector Samwell continue their journey to Castle Black, the headquarters of the Night's Watch. Based on Samwell's knowledge of the roads and places in the North, they head for Nightfort, an abandoned castle which was formerly the headquarters of the Night's Watch and is situated between Castle Black and Beyond the Wall.[4] After travelling past the Wall, Sam and the adults finally reach Nightfort, where they encounter Bran Stark, the half-brother of Samwell's friend Jon Snow. Bran and his companionsâJojen Reed and his sister Meera, the servant Hodor and the direwolf Summer are travelling Beyond the Wall in search of the Three-Eyed Raven.[5]
            Due to their experiences beyond the Wall, Samwell and Gilly are not willing to return to the Wall with Bran and company. They part company, and Sam and the adults complete their journey to Castle Black. There, they met Maester Aemon, who is furious at the prospect that Samwell has violated his vows. However, Aemon's demeanor softens upon learning that Gilly was one of the late Craster's wives and that Sam is one of his offspring. Aemon acknowledges that Gilly is now a refugee and that she and her child should be sheltered since the North is no longer safe for humans. Aemon then orders Sam to begin writing letters immediately and to make sure that all forty-four of Castle Black's ravens are well-fed, as every one of them will fly that night: the White Walkers have returned, and Westeros must be warned. For the moment, Sam and his mother are safe from the White Walkers.[5]
            Worried about Gilly and her baby, Samwell Tarly has them sent away to Mole's Town. Gilly is given work at the local brothel.[6]
            A whore is annoyed thatÂ Gilly's baby woke her up during a night in Mole's Town. Meanwhile, aÂ wildling raiding party, including Tormund, Styr, and Ygritte,Â attack the town, killing everyone in their path. Ygritte discovers Gilly hiding with her baby, but urges them to keep quiet, sparing their lives.[7]
            Gilly and her baby flee to the safety of Castle Black. Sam is overjoyed to see them and has them hide in a storage room for the duration of the battle.[8]
            Little Sam remains with his mother Gilly at Castle Black. However, Gilly is fearful that she and her baby may be sent away if Ser Alliser Thorne is chosen as the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.[9]
            On his deathbed, Maester Aemon fondly interacts with Little Sam, recalling that his younger brother Egg had a jolly laugh just like him when he was a baby. His strength failing, he also warns Gilly that she must go south with her baby before it is too late - winter is almost upon them and the White Walkers will come with it to attack the Wall.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sam</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascSam</string></dict>

        <key>Cheese</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.111.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"Cheese"Â was a rat-catcher hired byÂ Daemon Targaryen to avenge the death of Lucerys Velaryon.
            AfterÂ Lucerys VelaryonÂ was killed byÂ Aemond Targaryen, Lucerys's stepfatherÂ Daemon TargaryenÂ hired two assassins, Blood andÂ Cheese, to killÂ Aegon'sÂ andÂ Helaena'sÂ children. Blood was a formerÂ GoldcloakÂ and Cheese was a rat-catcher who knew all the sewers aroundÂ King's Landing and had worked within the Red Keep. This meant that they both had perfect recognition of the layout of theÂ Red Keep. After breaking into the royal apartments, they found Helaena putting her children to bed. They demanded a son for a son. Helaena pleaded they kill her instead, but they refused. She named her younger sonÂ MaelorÂ as the victim. However, Cheese just told Maelor that his mother wanted him dead, and some believe that Helaena named Maelor becauseÂ Jaehaerys was heir to theÂ Iron Throne, or because Maelor was just to young to understand. This request became an act of defiance against theÂ Greens, as Blood just beheaded Jaehaerys with a single blow. By the time the guards came, the Queen was cradling her son's body. Jaehaerys's death would eventually led to his mother's insanity and suicide.[1]
            After the death of PrinceÂ Lucerys Velaryon, Cheese, along withÂ BloodÂ was employed byÂ Mysaria, PrinceÂ Daemon Targaryen's spymaster, to slay one ofÂ Aegon II Targaryen' sons.
            Using a forgotten passageway in the Red Keep, Cheese led Blood into the heart of the castle unseen by any guard. The two men crept up through the walls and slipped into QueenÂ Alicent Hightower's chambers. Once inside Cheese bound and gagged the Dowager Queen whilst Blood strangled her bedmaid. Then they waited for QueenÂ Helaena TargaryenÂ and her children to arrive.
            Once Blood and Cheese confronted Helaena in theÂ Tower of the HandÂ they told her to name which son she wanted them to kill. Helaena offered herself but they refused, stating it had to be a son. Although Helaena eventually named her youngest sonÂ MaelorÂ (after Cheese threatened her that Blood would rape her daughterÂ JaehaeraÂ if she did not choose one), they killedÂ JaehaerysÂ instead. It was Blood who slew Jaehaerys, striking the boy's head off with a single blow. After killing the prince Blood and Cheese did no further harm to Helaena or her surviving children and fled with the prince's head in hand.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cheese</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCheese</string></dict>

            When the Dornish Vulture King rebelled against King Aenys, Sam played a leading part in the Vulture Hunt to defeat him. He wielded the family's ancestral Valyrian steel sword Heartsbane, which was said to run red from point to hilt with rebel blood.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sam_Tarly</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascSamTarly</string></dict>
        <key>Samwell Tarly</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.113.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Samwell Tarly, or simply Sam, is a steward in the Night's Watch and is Jon Snow's closest friend. He is the eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly and Lady Melessa Tarly of Horn Hill and older brother of Dickon and Talla Tarly. He was forced to join the Night's Watch by his father under the threat of death, putting him out of the line of inheritance for House Tarly. Though he is overweight and not the bravest or the most skilled of men, traits looked down upon by his father, he is intelligent, well-educated, and insightful, his vast knowledge serving the Night's Watch well in their battles with the forces beyond the Wall.
            Samwell Tarly is the oldest son and former heir of Lord Randyll Tarly, the head of House Tarly and Lord of Horn Hill. House Tarly is one of the most powerful noble families in the Reach, and sworn to House Tyrell. By rights, Samwell would have grown up to be one of the top ranking lords of the Seven Kingdoms.
            However, his father Randyll Tarly is one of the most skilled military commanders in Westeros, and hoped for a son who would carry on his leadership of House Tarly in battle, not an overweight scholarly-minded son like Sam who has no thirst for violence. His father, ashamed of him, forced Samwell to take the black under threat of death in order to disinherit him. Had Sam refused to join the Night's Watch, his father bluntly told him that he would arrange a "hunting trip" with his son in the woods, and then kill Sam in such a way that it looked like an accident (though it is unknown if Randyll would really have done this). Sam departed for the Wall, leaving his younger brother Dickon as heir to House Tarly.[2]
            Sam was a virgin when he left for the Wall, and is a bit despondent about the restriction that his vows forbid him from ever taking a wife in the future.
            Samwell Tarly arrives at Castle Black. Ser Alliser Thorne identifies him as a soft, pampered lordling and has the other recruits attack him harshly, mockingly calling him "Lady Piggy". Jon Snow defends Samwell, to Alliser's annoyance. Samwell is assigned watches with Jon. He tells Jon that he is craven and that his father forced him to come to the Wall or face a 'hunting accident' that would result in his death. Jon convinces the other recruits to go easy on Sam, even using Ghost to intimidate Rast into doing so. Sam befriends Pypar and Grenn.[3]
            Thorne is furious at Jon's actions and confronts him and Sam. He tells them of the harsh conditions that exist beyond the Wall and claims men are driven to do terrible things to survive out there, especially in winter. He says that by avoiding the harsh discipline of the Night's Watch, they are condemning themselves to death.[3]
            The trainees become men of the Night's Watch and Samwell is assigned to the stewards, specifically to the service of Maester Aemon. When Jon complains about his appointment as a steward to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, Sam points out that Mormont could be grooming him for command. Sam, feeling that his own gods have abandoned him, elects to say his oath to the Watch before a heart tree like Jon, hoping that the Old Gods would answer his prayers in a way that the Seven never did. After the ceremony, they are surprised when Ghost arrives, carrying a severed hand in his mouth.[4]
            The hand leads them to the bodies of two rangers. They bring the corpses back to Castle Black and Sam notes that there is no smell of rotten flesh on them. The Lord Commander orders the bodies examined, and tells Sam that he may be a coward, but certainly not stupid.[5]
            Jon Snow and the Lord Commander are attacked by one of the dead, who has risen as a wight. Jon fights off the wight and Sam watches the two corpses being burned. Sam tells the others that he has read an old book that claimed that reviving the dead can only be achieved by the touch of the White Walkers, who sleep for thousands of years beneath the ice. When the others ask what will happen when they wake up, he only says that he hopes that the Wall is high enough.[5] Sam admires Jon's new sword, Longclaw, given as a gift for defending the Lord Commander.[6] Samwell tries, unsuccessfully, to stop Jon leaving the wall when he receives news of his father's execution in King's Landing. He then convinces Pyp and Grenn to help him to pursue Jon. He is knocked off his horse by a low hanging branch which draws Jon back to check if he is okay. Sam stands, unharmed, and recites his vows with his friends to convince Jon to return.[7]
            Sam is part of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's Great Ranging beyond the Wall. After travelling for months and passing several abandoned wildling villages they reach Craster's Keep. Craster is an unsavoury ally of the Watch who marries his daughters and apparently has no sons. Craster tells them that the wildlings are gathering under King Beyond the Wall Mance Rayder.[8] Sam calls off Ghost, Jon's direwolf, when he comes near Gilly, one of Craster's wives. Gilly calls Sam brave. Sam takes her to Jon Snow for help rescuing her unborn child from CrasterÂ but Jon refuses to disobey their orders to stay away from Craster's wives. Jon later follows Craster into the woods and sees him leaving a newborn boy for the White Walkers. Craster spots him and incapacitates him.[9] Craster drags Jon back to his keep and demands that the Watch leave. Sam becomes infatuated with Gilly, vowing to return and rescue her.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Samwell_Tarly</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascSamwellTarly</string></dict>

            Stiv, Osha, and Wallen flee south of the Wall, apparently in fear of the return of the White Walkers. In the woods near Winterfell they stumble across Bran Stark and decide to steal his horse. Realizing his importance, they ponder taking him prisoner and returning him to Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, for a reward, but decide against it. Robb Stark intervenes, and kills Wallen and disables Osha.Â Stiv holds a knife to Bran's throat, and despite Bran's protests not to, Robb lowers his sword as Stiv tells him to. However, Theon Greyjoy shoots him through the back with an arrow, killing him. Osha surrenders to Stark custody.[1]

            Steffon Baratheon was the Lord of Storm's End and head of House Baratheon, one of the Great Houses of Westeros. He is the father of Robert, Stannis and Renly Baratheon. He lived with his family at Storm's End.
            He has an entry in the The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, as read by Eddard Stark.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Steffon Baratheon is the son of the former Lord Baratheon and Rhaelle Targaryen, the sister of King Jaehaerys II and aunt of the Mad King. This relationship is what allowed Robert to claim the Iron Throne during Robert's Rebellion.
            Steffon Baratheon appears to have been an effective lord. He was once defeated by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen during a tournament. He was sent by King Aerys II to the Free Cities to find a bride for Prince Rhaegar, but he found no suitable matches. He did find a talented fool, however, one whom he believed would teach even Stannis to laugh. However, Lord Steffon's ship, the Windproud, sank in Shipbreaker Bay within sight of Storm's End. His body and that of his wife, Lady Cassana of House Estermont, was never found. The fool, Patchface, did wash ashore, but the trauma of the event robbed him of his wits.
            In his youth, Steffon served as a page at King's Landing, and became close friends with Aerys and Tywin Lannister. As Aerys's relationship with Tywin deteriorated, many believed that the king would name Steffon as Hand of the KingÂ upon his return from the Free Cities; instead, matters only grew worse after Steffon's death, as Aerys became convinced that Tywin had arranged the sinking of the Windproud to prevent Steffon from taking his place.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Steffon_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascSteffonBaratheon</string></dict>

Instead, Dagmer knocks Theon unconscious and the garrison surrenders.[1]
            Balon and Yara Greyjoy learn that the ironborn captured at Winterfell were all flayed alive on Ramsay Snow's orders, despite being promised mercy if they surrendered.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Stygg's background is the same. He is among the ironborn who raid the Stony Shore and part of the force that captures Winterfell.
            When the residents of Winterfell are gathered and told that they are captives of the ironborn, Stygg kills Mikken for speaking defiantly to Theon. Osha offers to serve Theon (falsely, while she stays loyal to the Starks), Stygg taunts her rudely, and in response she knees him in the groin and grabs his spear, to the amusement of Theon and the other ironborn. After the capture, Theon sent him to request aid from his sister Asha at Deepwood Motte.
            As Theon's position becomes hopeless, he tells the ironborn they can leave and join his sister's troops at Deepwood Motte or stay and fight with him against the Northmen who will arrive soon to retake Winterfell. Stygg is among those who abandon Theon, and he is the only of those who has the grace to look ashamed.

        <key>Styr</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.117.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Styr was a wildling and the Magnar of Thenn, the leader of one of the fiercest tribes of theÂ Free Folk, andÂ a lieutenant ofÂ Mance Rayder.
            Styr is the Magnar of the Thenn, a fierce tribe of Free Folk known for their practice of ritual self-scarification and engaging in cannibalism of their fallen enemies. Styr is a very highly-skilled warrior and is capable of wielding a great axe with ease due to his size and strength.
            At some point, Mance Rayder convinced StyrÂ to join his army and acknowledge him as the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Styr became one of Mance's lieutenants, along chieftains such as Tormund Giantsbane and the Lord of Bones.
            StyrÂ leads a group of Thenns towardsÂ Castle Black and encounters Tormund and Ygritte after the warg in his group sees them through the eyes of his owl. Styr mocks them over the death of Orell and their failure to kill Jon Snow. Afterwards, he and his fellow Thenns prepare to eat a member of the Night's Watch whom they have recently killed.[1]
            Styr, Tormund,Â Ygritte and other wildlingsÂ attack a village killing all of its residents, save for one child. Styr orders this child to run to Castle Black to warn the Night's Watch about the wildlings. Before this, he informs the child that he is going to eat his dead parents.[2]
            Styr and Tormund attack the settlement of Mole's Town. They slaughter most of the inhabitants, which include members of the Night's Watch who were visiting the local brothel. News of this attack reaches Castle Black, which is their next target.[3]
            Just outside of Castle Black, Styr chastises Ygritte for not killing Jon Snow when she had the chance. Soon after, his warg has spotted Mance Rayder's signal and they attack Castle Black. During the battle, he kills numerous black brothers before spotting Jon Snow. In the midst of the fighting, Styr and Jon duel each other in the courtyard of Castle Black. Styr gets the upper hand by knocking away Longclaw from Jon and fighting hand to hand. He forces Jon's head into a blacksmith anvil, however, Jon eventually distracts him by spitting in his face (which he learned from Karl Tanner) and smashes Styr's head in with a hammer, killing him.[4]
            After the arrival of Stannis Baratheon and his army, Jon enters the chambers where Tormund is being held and mentions that the bodies of the fallen wildlings are going to be burned.Â Styr's body is burned along with the other wildlings.[5]
            Dutch actor Yorick van Wageningen auditioned for the role of Styr.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Styr is one of Mance Rayder's lieutenants and the Magnar - "Lord" in the Old Tongue of the First Men - of the Thenn people, a clan of Free Folk established in a valley north of the Frostfangs. Unlike the other wildling clans, the Thenn actually have lords (more like hereditary chieftains), and live under established laws that they enforce. As a result they are the most disciplined of the wildling clans, making them organized and dangerous in combat; they also possess the most advanced armor and weaponry among the Free Folk. The Magnar's followers worship the man like a god, and follow every order, however ridiculous.
            In the series, much of his plotline from A Storm of Swords is taken by Tormund Giantsbane - including being mistaken by Jon Snow for Mance, and leading the climb over the Wall. He is described as a tall lean man with no ears, clean shaven, bald with a straight nose and grey eyes. He doesn't speak the Common Tongue, speaking only the Old Tongue.
            Styr is also not a cannibal, and doesn't possess scars on his head.
            Styr is not killed by Jon in personal combat. During the Battle of Castle Black he leads the majority of the Thenns to mount the stair and push back the crumbling defense, killing some of the brothers and villagers. Because Jon warned the Watch of their approach, the garrison knew they were coming and sprung a trap: the stair, soaked in oil between the last Watch line of defense and the base of the structure, is set ablaze, destroying the stair and killing Styr and most of his men.
            Styr is succeeded by his son Sigorn as the Magnar of Thenn. Sigorn later marries Alys Karstark, an arrangement by Jon Snow, with the intention of founding House Thenn.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Styr</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascStyr</string></dict>
        <key>Stevron Frey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.118.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Stevron Frey was the firstborn son and heir of Lord Walder Frey, the head of House Frey and Lord of the Crossing.
            Stevron is present when Catelyn Stark visits Lord Walder Frey to negotiate passage for her son Robb Stark's army across the Trident following the arrest of Eddard Stark. He admonishes his father for forgetting his courtesies. Walder reminds Stevron that he is not yet Lord and then reluctantly kisses Catelyn's hand. Walder rudely dismisses Stevron and the rest of his very large family to talk with Catelyn in private.[1]
            Unless he died sometime during the War of the Five Kings, Strevron is supposedly murdered, along with his other male family members, by Arya Stark, in retaliation for the Red Wedding.
            In A Song of Ice and Fire, Ser Stevron resembles a weasel, like his father. He has grey eyes. A man in his sixties, Stevron's appearance shows his age. Walder has groomed him for lordship of the house, though Walder often jokes that Stevron has been waiting for him to die for forty years. Through his father, Stevron has learned to place great importance on the family. Stevron, unlike his father is amiable and reasonable. In the book Stevron rides out to parley with the Stark army on their arrival.
            Stevron participates the council of Robb and his bannermen at Riverrun. He suggests to sit on the fence and let the two kings fight each other, then bend their knees to the winner or oppose him, as they see fit. He also suggests to offer truce to Tywin Lannister, but is sharply silenced by other lords who wouldn't hear of making peace with the Lannisters.
            He is badly wounded at the Battle of Oxcross but no one thought his wounds were fatal; nonetheless he was found dead in his tent three days later, having succumbed to his injuries. When the news about his death reach Winterfell, Lord Walder's grandsons are not sad at all to hear their uncle is dead, they only argue who is the heir now.
            Following Stevron's death, due to the primogeniture laws of the Seven Kingdoms, his own son Ryman become next in line to succeed Lord Walder, ahead of Walder's numerous younger sons.
            Ryman is one of the Freys who welcomed Robb and his followers to Edmure's wedding. Strangely, he told Robb "If you would follow me, my father awaits" instead of "my grandfather". It can be Martin's error, or a cruel joke of Ryman who knew Robb would soon join the late Stevron. Robb paid no attention to that oddity, just as he ignored all the other warning signs - mainly Grey Wind's aggressive behavior toward the Freys.
            His fate in the TV show was unknown because it was never mentioned that a member of House Frey died during the timespan of the war, though it was presumed he was still alive due to lack of evidence otherwise, but after the assassination with poisoned wine by Arya Stark it can be assumed that he died together with the other male members of House Frey.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Stevron_Frey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascStevronFrey</string></dict>
        <key>Stannis Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.119.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Stannis I Baratheon was the Lord of Dragonstone, the younger brother of King Robert Baratheon and older brother of Renly Baratheon.
            Following Robert's death and the revelation that Robert's heir, Joffrey, is actually Queen Cersei's bastard son with her twin brother Jaime, Stannis declares himself the rightful King and begins a campaign to take the Iron Throne from the Lannisters. After amassing an army, Stannis attacks King's Landing and almost breaches the city, but is defeated by combined Lannister-Tyrell reinforcements and forced to retreat to Dragonstone. While planning his next move following the deaths of Joffrey and Robb Stark, Stannis travels North to the Wall to aid the Night's Watch against a wildling invasion and meets Jon Snow, attempting to acquire his help in retaking the North from House Bolton, who previously betrayed House Stark and murdered Robb. Stannis ultimately marches on Winterfell alone, but the weather slows his progress and he and his army are smashed by Bolton forces in the ensuing battle. In the aftermath, he is found, injured and exhausted from the battle and ultimately killed by Brienne of Tarth for his role in Renly's death.
            Stannis is the second-born son of Steffon BaratheonÂ and Cassana Baratheon, the younger brother of the late King Robert Baratheon and older brother of Renly Baratheon. Steffon was the head of House Baratheon and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The Stormlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Baratheon is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Steffon died when the boys were young and Robert inherited his titles. Stannis is a serious and severe man.[1]
            Robert led a rebellion against King Aerys II Targaryen, deposing and replacing him as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Stannis fought for Robert during the war. He was besieged at Storm's End for much of the conflict. He was rescued from starvation by the smuggler Davos, who brought a ship full of onions into the castle. Stannis knighted Davos as a reward but also punished him for his smuggling by cutting four finger tips from his right hand. Davos is fiercely loyal to Stannis and saw his punishment as just.[2][3] Davos's son Matthos served Stannis as a scribe.[4] Stannis went on to conquer Dragonstone, the seat of House Targaryen. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.[5]
            Stannis and Robert never loved one another.[6][7] Despite Stannis's service during the war, Robert made their infant brother Renly (who was too young to have fought in the war) Lord of Storm's End following his victory, which Stannis took as an affront.[8] Stannis was madeÂ Lord of Dragonstone and served on his brother's small council as Master of Ships. Though not outright cruel or malicious, he is a stern and humorless man, making him the least popular of the Baratheon brothers.[1]
            He married Selyse Florent.[1] They have a loveless marriage; Stannis regards her as sickly and resents her failure to bear him a son.[9] During the first season Stannis is on Dragonstone for an extended stay, preferring the solitude of the island.[1]
            He has converted to the Lord of Light under the influence of the priestess Melisandre. His household have largely followed his conversion.[10] He has adopted the flaming red heart of the Lord of Light with the stag of Baratheon in the middle as his sigil.[11]
            Stannis is first mentioned during a conversation between his younger brother Renly and Ser Loras Tyrell, in which Loras suggests that Renly could take the Iron Throne himself. Renly points out that he is fourth in the line of succession, behind his nephews and Stannis. Loras claims that no-one would support Stannis for the crown because he "has the personality of a lobster".[12]
            King Robert tells Eddard Stark that he does not love his brothers, and considers Eddard to be his true brother.[8]
            After King Robert's death, and realizing the truth of Joffrey's parentage, Eddard decides to back Stannis as the rightful King. Renly offers to help Eddard take Joffrey into custody, but only if Eddard backs Renly's own claim to the throne. Eddard angrily rejects the suggestion, pointing out that Stannis has the better claim and is a skilled battle commander and leader. Renly counters that Stannis is a good soldier like Robert, but like Robert may not make the best king. Eddard later sends a letter to Stannis at his fortress stronghold of Dragonstone, informing him of the situation. Littlefinger also advocates backing someone else - Joffrey or Renly - and manipulating them from behind the scenes, since Stannis claiming the throne will plunge the Seven Kingdoms into war. Eddard is adamant that Stannis is the rightful heir.[5]
            Varys tells Eddard that Queen Cersei is more concerned about Stannis than anyone else, including the army that Robb Stark has raised. Stannis is a proven and experienced battle commander and is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies. Eddard replies that Stannis is the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne, to Varys' disappointment.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascStannisBaratheon</string></dict>

As the wildlings approach the wall and start to climb, Smitty and another brother repel down with their bows. At Jon's signal, Smitty shoots his arrow and pierces a wildling in the shoulder, causing him to fall down to his death. As the members of the Night's Watch send oil barrels down on the wildlings at the gate, one barrel gets trapped on the ramp, as it explodes it sends flaming rubble across the Wall, and a piece impales the brother holding Smitty's repel rope in the chest.

        <key>Selwyn Tarth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.121.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Selwyn Tarth is the Lord of Evenfall Hall, head of House Tarth and the father of the warrior woman Brienne.
            Selwyn Tarth is the Lord of Evenfall Hall and the head of House Tarth, a vassal house of House Baratheon of Storm's End. He is the ruler of Tarth, an island located in Shipbreaker Bay in the Stormlands. He trained his daughter Brienne to be an accomplished warrior. After the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings, Lord Selwyn declared for Renly Baratheon and sent Brienne to join his army.
            After Brienne defeats Loras Tyrell in single combat, King Renly is impressed by the warrior-woman's prowess and states that she is everything her father said she was and more.[1] When Jaime Lannister meets Brienne for the first time, he spends a moment trying to recall Tarth, then remembers that its lord is her father, Selwyn of House Tarth.[2]
            When the captured Brienne is about to be raped by Locke and then by his men, Jaime successfully stops them by promising Lord Selwyn Tarth would pay a high ransom for his only surviving child's return, but only if Brienne's honor remains "unbesmirched." Jaime tells Locke that Tarth is famous as "the Sapphire Isle" because it is the location of all sapphire mines in Westeros, and Lord Selwyn will give him Brienne's weight in sapphires for her release. Locke agrees and calls off his men before they can rape Brienne.[3]
            Brienne subsequently points out to Jaime in private that Tarth is called "the Sapphire Isle" because of the blue of the surrounding waters - there are no sapphire gemstones. She realizes Jaime must have known this, but embellished her father's wealth in order to convince Locke to leave her unharmed.[4]
            Lord Selwyn responds to Locke's ransom demand via raven, offering a ransom of three hundred Gold Dragons in exchange for Brienne's release. Unfortunately, Locke became so convinced by Jaime's previous spur of the moment lie to save Brienne that he refuses Selwyn's offer, and will settle for nothing less than literally Brienne's weight in sapphire gemstones. Selwyn's messages insist there are no sapphires on Tarth but Locke simply thinks he is refusing to pay. Locke and his men decide to entertain themselves by putting Brienne into Harrenhal's bear pit, but she is saved by the Jaime's intervention.[5]
            Cersei Lannister tells Brienne at Joffrey's wedding that as "Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter, that makes you a lady whether you want to be or not".[6]
            Brienne mentions her father when she encounters Arya Stark. She reminisces how Lord Selwyn told her that it was not proper behavior for a lady to pursue martial activity. However, Brienne did not listen and continued fighting other boys until her father relented and personally trained her as a warrior.[7]
            Brienne recounts to Podrick Payne how her father held a ball for her and invited dozens of young highborn suitors.[8]
            At Riverrun, Brienne mentions who she is a second time while attempting to convince Brynden Tully to join Sansa Stark in the North. He cuts her off, stating that he knows and admires her father.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Selwyn Tarth is described as a good man of fifty-four years old. Also known as "The Evenstar", he is a widower remembered by Brienne as having a new woman every year. He initially declares House Tarth's support for Renly. After Renly dies, it isn't clearly stated whom he supports. He certainly didn't send troops to aid Stannis, but it's unclear if he bent the knee to Joffrey, outright lent his support to him, or simply adopted an isolationist stance, like Lord Gulian Swann.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Selwyn_Tarth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascSelwynTarth</string></dict>

            Blessed by the Drowned God, the Grey King was said to have waged war against the Storm God himself and slain Nagga, the first sea dragon, using its bones to build his hall. Legend has it that he also took a mermaid as his wife and lived for a thousand years.[2] He had 16 sons, but only one succeeded him due to the newly made creation of the Kingsmoot.
            The A Song of Ice and Fire novels give more detail about the Grey King's life. He reigned for a thousand years with a mermaid as his wife and plotted his war against the Storm God. He supposedly wore robes of woven seaweed and a tall pale crown made from Nagga's teeth. From Nagga's bones he made his hall, the Grey King's Hall, which he heated with Nagga's living fire. When the Grey King died, the Storm God snuffed out the fire and the sea stole his throne. Only his hall remains.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Grey_King</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGreyKing</string></dict>
        <key>Grey Worm</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.125.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Grey Worm (Valyrian: Torgo Nudho) is the chosen commander of the Unsullied, the warrior-eunuchs of Astapor whose reputation for combat is without equal.
            Grey Worm became one of the main advisors to Daenerys Targaryen after she acquires the Unsullied from the Masters of Astapor. He participates in the sack of Astapor, inflitrated Yunkai and led the liberation of Meereen. Â During the subsequent resistance movement by the Sons of the Harpy, Grey Worm is severely injured in an ambush.Â After Daenerys leaves Meereen on the back of her dragon, Drogon, Grey Worm remains in Meereen to support Tyrion Lannister's rule of the city while Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis track down the missing queen. He later falls in love with Daenery's advisor and handmaiden Missandei. Grey Worm then sails with Daenerys in order to reclaim theÂ Iron Throne. As part of Daenerys' invasion, Grey Worm and his Unsullied capture Casterly Rock.
            Like all Unsullied, Grey Worm's castration as a boy resulted in changes to his body's hormones, so he is smooth-cheeked with absolutely no facial hair.
            Grey Worm was originally a boy taken into slavery by the Good Masters of Astapor, an oligarchy of slave-traders dedicated to the training and commerce of Unsullied, warrior-eunuch slaves trained into absolute obedience since early childhood. It later is revealed that he is originally from the Summer Islands and was taken by the slavers in a raid as a baby. He has no memory of his life before being an Unsullied.[1]
            He is released from slavery after Daenerys Targaryen buys all the Unsullied in the city and has them put all slave owners in Astapor to the sword and release all slaves. Once released, Grey Worm, like all his brethren, chooses to fight for Daenerys as a free man.[2]
            As per Daenerys's instructions, the Unsullied officers select their own leader to act as their official commander, reporting directly to her. Grey Worm is selected, though it is not established how. Upon reporting his election to Daenerys, she finds his name and its associated practiceâ given to him by the Good Masters to remind him that he is verminâ distasteful, and tells him that he and all Unsullied may use their original names or chose new ones they like. Grey Worm agrees to disseminate the instructions to the other Unsullied, but chooses to keep his. He considers that his birth name was cursed as he had it when was taken as a slave, while "Grey Worm" is a lucky name as it was the one he had when Daenerys Stormborn set him free.[3]
            After Daenerys and her army set camp a short distance from Yunkai, Daenerys has Grey Worm send a man to the Yunkish gates to deliver a message to the Wise Masters: she will receive them in her camp to accept their surrender.[4]
            Grey Worm is present when Daenerys hosts the captains of the Second Sons, Mero and Prendahl na Ghezn, and their lieutenant Daario Naharis. Grey Worm is highly offended by Mero's boorish and insulting behavior towards Daenerys and Missandei, and offers - in Low Valyrian - to remove Mero's tongue as punishment, reaching for the bronze dagger in his belt. Daenerys graciously has him stand down.[5]
            Grey Worm is present when Jorah Mormont and Daario plan the infiltration of Yunkai. Grey Worm remains silent throughout most of the meeting, until Daenerys asks for his opinion of Daario. Grey Worm is not used to having his own opinions, but Daenerys gently encourages him by saying that he is a leader now, and he responds that he trusts him. Daenerys sends the three to sneak into the city. Grey Worm proves himself an artist with his spear, easily besting dozens of Yunkish guards. He returns to his queen battered but uninjured at the end of the night.[6]
            Ser Barristan and Missandei reveal that Grey Worm and Daario have been indulging in a bit of gambling: they have been at the contest since midnight and have missed a morning meeting with the queen as a result. Daenerys is very irritated to discover that their contest is a game of who can balance their sword for the longest, the prize being the honor of riding at her side when the march resumes. Daenerys assigns the pair to guard the livestock as punishment for their childish game. When they fail to move, she casually warns them that the "winner" of the contest must find a new queen, prompting them to drop their weapons instantly. Grey Worm's gaze lingers on Missandei, which Daario takes as a sign that he is interested in her, and points out that this problematic given Grey Worm's eunuch status. Grey Worm tells Daario that he is not a smart man for saying such things.[7]
            At the gates of Meereen, Grey Worm asks to be allowed to kill the city's champion for Daenerys. The queen declines as she is unwilling to risk her army's official commander.[8]
            Missandei is revealed to have been teaching Grey Worm the Common Tongue. As the lessons progress, Missandei and Grey Worm discuss their lost homelands (Naath and the Summer Isles respectively) and Grey Worm's eagerness to kill the Masters of Slaver's Bay. Daenerys interrupts them to dispatch Grey Worm on a mission of subterfuge: he is to sneak into Meereen and arm the slaves there.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Grey_Worm</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGreyWorm</string></dict>
        <key>Salladhor Saan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.126.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Salladhor Saan is a pirate-lord and sellsail, commanding a fleet of thirty ships.
            He was recruited to King Stannis Baratheon's cause but Salladhor abandoned him after the Battle of the Blackwater. Salladhor re-entered Stannis' service, however, after Stannis secured a loan from the Iron Bank of Braavos, enabling him to pay Salladhor's fee.
            Salladhor Saan is a pirate-lord from Lys, though a native of the Summer Isles. He commands a fleet of thirty ships that frequently prey on merchant ships traveling between Westeros and the Free Cities to the east. Sometimes in pursuit of extra wealth, he shifts from pure piracy to being a sellsail: hiring out the services of his ships and crews to the highest bidder, to act as mercenaries in various conflicts.
            Doreah pleasures Viserys and tells him that she once saw a pirate covered in gold who flew colorful sails.
            Davos Seaworth and his son Matthos meet Saan on a beach nearby Dragonstone. Davos promises the pirate he will be paid a fortune in gold when they take King's Landing. Salladhor is dubious of Stannis Baratheon's chances as he has the smallest army of all the claimants to the Iron Throne, to which Davos answers that Stannis is a proven battle commander unlike the inexperienced Renly or Joffrey, adding that Stannis has just begun the fight and expects more of his bannerman to join his cause because he is the most honorable man in the Seven Kingdoms. Salladhor notes the irony of a smuggler vouching for the honor of a king.Â Matthos warns Salladhor to mind his words, calling him a pirate. Davos silences his son and Salladhor points out he is not insulted, asserting being not only a pirate but an excellent one and that he does not sail for promises. Davos challenges this, explaining that Salladhor sails on a promise of ships to plunder every time he leaves port. Salladhor says that promise always comes true and Davos says that his promise is the same. Davos points out that Salladhor is not a young man and that pirate's lives are short. Salladhor jokes that only the clever pirates grow old. Davos suggests that Salladhor could continue to steal from cargo ships and live an easy life while it lasts but that he is offering a harder alternative with greater rewards. He promises riches and fame.
            Salladhor says that he has a good name for songs and then tells Davos that he wants Queen Cersei. He says that he will lend his thirty ships provided he can get Cersei when they take King's Landing. Matthos is annoyed by Salladhor's selfishness and says they are not fighting for Salladhor to rape the Queen. Salladhor makes the distinction that he does not intend to rape her and jokes that Matthos has not experienced his persuasiveness. Matthos insists that Stannis has a divine right to rule and that the Lord of Light is the only god. However, Salladhor is dismissive of religion. Matthos turns away and Davos says that he cannot promise the Queen, only the gold and glory. Salladhor asks if Davos believes that Stannis can win and Davos replies that Stannis is the "one true king." Salladhor contrasts Davos's loyalty to Stannis against their history together; Stannis chopped off Davos's fingers for smuggling. Salladhor says that he will sail with Davos because Davos is the most honest smuggler he has ever met and asks Davos to make him rich. They shake hands and Salladhor leaves.
            Later that night Davos informs Stannis that Salladhor has agreed to join his forces. Stannis asks Davos if they can trust Salladhor, and he responds that he has known Salladhor for thirty years but has never "trusted" him. However, Davos is certain that Salladhor has been tantalized by his promise of vast wealth.[1]
            Salladhor's ship rescues Davos, who was thrown overboard by the wildfire blast in the Battle of Blackwater, from the sea. Salladhor, who abandoned Stannis' cause after the battle, offers DavosÂ his hospitality butÂ is very reluctant to take DavosÂ to Dragonstone. He tries to dissuade Davos from trying to kill the red priestess Melisandre since she has sacrificed any man who speaks against her since the Battle of the Blackwater. He says she accuses those who are against her of being servants of darkness, and since they're both criminals they should stay well away. Davos insists on being taken back to Stannis's castle, and Salladhor eventually agrees to stay just long enough to see Davos ashore.[2]
            Having returned to Braavos after his failed exploits off the coasts of Westeros, Salladhor spends his time with a couple of whores in a bathhouse. He tells them a joke about a brave ship captain facing pirate ships, but is not amused when the whores reveal they know the punchline just before he delivers it. He is surprised when Ser Davos appears and tells him they will sail for Castle Black at sunrise. The pirate begins to complain, but Davos throws him a package of gold coins from the Iron Bank, noting that more money waits at his home â with his wife. Salladhor sarcastically declares that contrary to popular opinion, Davos is not his friend.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Salladhor_Saan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascSalladhorSaan</string></dict>

            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Symon Hollard was a key accomplice in the Defiance of Duskendale, when Lord Denys Darklyn of Duskendale defied King Aerys II and captured him, imprisoning him within the Dun Fort.
            Ser Symon slew Ser Gwayne Gaunt of the Kingsguard during the taking of the King. When Ser Barristan Selmy of the Kingsguard entered the Dun Fort and escaped with the King, he avenged Ser Gwayne by killing Ser Symon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Symon_Hollard</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascSymonHollard</string></dict>
        <key>Randyll Tarly</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.128.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Randyll Tarly was the Lord of Horn Hill, the head of House Tarly, and the father of Samwell Tarly, whom he forced to join the Night's Watch under the threat of death. He is the husband of Melessa Tarly and father of Dickon and Talla Tarly. He was a powerful bannerman of House Tyrell until he sided with House Lannister, remaining loyal to the crown, during Daenerys Targaryen's invasion of Westeros.
            Randyll Tarly is the Lord of Horn Hill and the head of House Tarly, a vassal family of House Tyrell of Highgarden. He is a fierce, ruthless warrior and a highly effective general. He is the father of Samwell Tarly and a younger son, Dickon, and at least one daughter, Talla.
            Along with his liege-lord Mace Tyrell, Randyll fought on the Targaryen side during Robert's Rebellion. He commanded the royalist victory at the Battle of Ashford, the only defeat that Robert Baratheon ever suffered in the entire war.
            Samwell recounts to Jon Snow that even though he was his father's eldest son and heir, he was disgusted with Samwell's "womanly" interest in books and learning and disdain for martial valor and combat. Soon before Sam turned eighteen, his father took him aside and bluntly told him that he was unworthy to inherit the Tarly lands and titles. Randyll ordered Sam to take the black and join the Night's Watch. Randyll told his son that if he did not, he would take him out on a hunt in the woods and kill him in such a way that it looked like an accident, apparently unconcerned of the fact that such an act would be considered kinslaying. Terrified, Sam did as he was bid and left Horn Hill for the Wall.[1]
            At Stannis Baratheon's war council, Davos Seaworth names Randyll Tarly amongst the many lords that have declared for Renly Baratheon.[2]
            Samwell mentions his father by name when explaining the concept of family names to Gilly. When she points out that Randyll is a handsome name, he asks her to please not give it to her newborn son.[3]
            Sam quips to Gilly that his father is not a very "literary man". Later, surprised that Samwell is Randyll's son, Stannis Baratheon recounts to Sam how Lord Randyll defeated Robert Baratheon in the Battle of Ashford â the only battle Robert ever lost, for which King Stannis considers Randyll a fine soldier.[4]
            Since the Citadel only allows men within its walls, Samwell decides to send Gilly and her baby Sam to live with his family at Horn Hill. While Sam admits that he does not get on well with his father Randyll, he reassures Gilly that his mother and sister are nice.[5]
            Sam decides not to leave Gilly and her son at Horn Hill and silently departs with them in the night. Before leaving the castle, Sam steals Heartsbane. Gilly is worried that Randyll will come after them - not for his son but for his sword - to which Sam replies that Randyll can "bloody well try".
            Randyll travels to King's Landing at the request on Cersei Lannister, the new Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Cersei implores Randyll, and the other lords of the Reach to pledge fealty to House Lannister in order to defend Westeros from Daenerys Targaryen and her combined army of Dothraki and Unsullied.
            Jaime speaks to Randyll alone and claims that Randyll is the most prominent of the lords of the Reach, and that the others will look to him when choosing sides. Randyll is reluctant to ally with the house that orchestrated the Red Wedding and break his oath to House Tyrell.
            Jaime reminds Randyll of his oath to the crown, appeals to his xenophobia reminding him that Olenna Tyrell is bringing savages and eunuchs to Westeros and promises him the title of Warden of the South.[7]
            Daenerys signals for three Dothraki men to apprehend him, but Dickon suddenly speaks up insisting he will have to be killed too. Randyll, horrified, tells his son to shut up. Tyrion reminds Dickon that he is the future ofÂ House Tarly, and insists that he better bend the knee, reminding him how what happened to House Tyrell, which Randyll silently nods in agreement so his son may be spared. Dickon refuses to relent his decision, thereby Tyrion proposes to Daenerys about having them committed to the cells instead, but Daenerys, being ruthless but pragmatic, does not wish to grant the reputation of putting traitors in chains, or many would take advantage. She resumes to carry out the sentence for them both, as they hold hands. Drogon unleashes his dragonfire, roasting Randyll and Dickon alive and reducing them both to flame and ash in seconds, killing them instantly. Terrified, the remaining soldiers kneel as Tyrion reflects uneasily over the execution.[9]
            
            Spoken by Randyll
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lord Randyll Tarly is considered one of the best battlefield commanders in the Seven Kingdoms, a general able to read the ground, weather conditions, and how a battle is progressing with impressive accuracy. During Robert's Rebellion he inflicted Robert's only defeat while commanding the TyrellÂ vanguard at theÂ Battle of Ashford. During the later stages of the rebellion he helped Lord Mace Tyrell besiege Storm's End, and bent the knee after the death of King Aerys II Targaryen. He wields the Valyrian steel sword Heartsbane in battle and is said to be utterly merciless to his foes. Although a ruthless and stern man, he is not outright sadistic, often dispensing strict justice that is nonetheless within the bounds of the law, similar to Stannis Baratheon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Randyll_Tarly</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRandyllTarly</string></dict>

            Sandhu met with the other Archmaesters of the Citadel to discuss a raven they had received from Maester Wolkan of Winterfell claiming that Bran Stark has seen the Night King and his army marching on Eastwatch-by-the-Sea through warging. Sandhu was very sceptical of this and suggested that Samwell Tarly disciplne his mind with more scribing when Samwell insisted that they take the message seriously. He agreed with Archmaester Ebrose when he suggested that the message could be a ploy by Daenerys Targaryen to leave Westeros defenceless by having the great houses send their armies to the Wall. He compared the content of the message to the work of Lodos, a prophet who claimed that the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon I Targaryen.[1]

        <key>Simon Toyne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.130.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Simon Toyne was the leader of the Kingswood Brotherhood, an outlaw brotherhood. He was killed by Ser Barristan Selmy.
            Simon Toyne was the leader of the Kingswood Brotherhood, a band of outlaws and bandits opposed to the rule of House Targaryen. They inhabited the Kingswood, a large area of woodland south-east of King's Landing. Roughly twenty years before the events of the series, King Aerys II Targaryen ordered the Brotherhood destroyed, a mission led by Ser Barristan Selmy of the Kingsguard. Selmy himself killed Toyne with a counter-riposte, a move witnessed by the then-squire Jaime Lannister.[1]
            Jaime recalls Selmy killing Toyne and cites his counter-riposte as the finest sword move he'd ever seen.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Simon was a descendant of House Toyne. House Toyne was formerly a house of honor, with one member serving in the Kingsguard of King Aegon IV Targaryen. When Aegon IV found this knight abed with one of his mistresses, he had him executed in a horrible fashion. The knight's brothers declared war against House Targaryen, slaying the infamous Dragonknight, Ser Aemon Targaryen. Simon was their descendant and the last of his line.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Simon_Toyne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascSimonToyne</string></dict>
        <key>Ray</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.131.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brother Ray was a veteran of the War of the Ninepenny Kings and a former mercenary who reformed himself and served the Faith of the Seven.
            Ray was once a sellsword, who would do whatever he was told. His friends believed he was not afraid of anything, but he admits he was only brave because he was worried people would see him for what he truly was: "a coward who followed orders". He burned down villages, stole crops, and killed anyone he was told to. He once cut the throat of a young boy as the mother, held back, screamed. That night, he could not forget the mothers screams, and became ashamed of what he was. After that, he became a man of peace, and an ordained septon.
            Ray discovered Sandor Clegane, the Hound, in the Vale, apparently dead. He had a broken leg, and was covered in bugs. When Ray tried to bury him, the Hound coughed, so Ray loaded him onto a wagon and took him to be nursed back to health. According to Ray, the Hound appeared to die a dozen more times while he was helping him to recover from his near death experience, but always survived. Eventually the Hound became healthy enough to help Ray and his "flock" in the construction of what appears to be a small sept.
            Ray and his followers, including the Hound, are building a sept by a forest in the hills. He goes to talk with the Hound, and asks how many men it took to take him down. When he hears it was a woman that wounded him, he laughs. During a lunching break, Ray sits with the Hound and recounts the story of his discovery. He asks what it was that kept the Hound alive, and is told that it was down to "hate", and being "tough to kill". Ray disagrees, and tells the Hound that he is alive because the gods have a plan for him. In this conversation, Ray admits that he does not know much about the gods and wonders aloud if the Seven, the Old Gods, and Rh'llor are all the same deity; he concludes that the most important thing is that there is a force greater than humankind out there. Later, he tells the story of how he became a religious man to his followers. During the story, three riders from the Brotherhood Without Banners, Flynn, Lem, and Morgan, arrive.
            Ray tells them the group has nothing to give the riders: no horses, gold, or weapons; only rest. The riders leave upon hearing this, and Ray refuses to fight them, claiming violence is a disease that should not be spread, despite the Hound arguing that it would spread anyhow if they did not prepare for combat. In exasperation, the Hound decides to go off into the woods to cut more firewood, saying that it would be a cold night. Ray offers to save some of the ale from dinner for him.
            However, later on in the evening, the building site is sacked and every one of Ray's followers are mercilessly killed. Ray himself is hanged from the rafters of the unfinished sept. His body is discovered by the Hound, who in retaliation picks up an axe to take revenge.[1]
            When Sandor finally catches up with Lem who is about to be hanged for his crimes, Beric Dondarrion and Thoros ask Clegane why he is after Lem. He replies, "He killed my friend", implying that Ray's teachings have had a significant impact on Sandor.
            In his sellsword past, Ray was craven and willing to commit atrocious acts of violence. However, after the harrowing incident in which he killed the boy in front of his mother, shame washed over Ray, causing him to follow a new path.
            In the present, Ray is a wise, kindly man who dedicates his life to helping others. He reveals to his group that his main goal now is to "bring a little goodness into the world", if only to make up for the wrongs he committed in the past. Ray firmly believes in redemption at any time, as shown when he tells his congregation that it is never too late for someone to turn their lives around. In regards to the gods, Ray takes a somewhat universalist stance, stating that he does not know much about the gods and that the Lord of Light, the Seven, and the Old Gods could be the same thing, and that what he knows is that there is simply some force greater than humanity out there. Not wishing to bring more violence into the world, Ray has adopted a pacifist attitude and eschews violence even when threatened; unfortunately, this love of peace proves to be his and his followers' downfall.
            Ray appears to be a combination of two book characters, Septon Meribald and the Elder Brother.
            Meribald is a septon who preaches to the common folk. He meets Brienne and Podrick and leads them to the Quiet Isle, where they meet the Elder Brother.
            The Elder Brother is a member of a community of male penitents living on the Quiet Isle. He tells Brienne and Podrick that he found Sandor Clegane, but that the Hound was dead and was buried by the Elder Brother himself.
            Neither of the two characters is known to have been killed like their TV series counterpart was. Sandor's return suggests that a future novel will reveal the Elder Brother's description was figurative: the Hound is dead, but Sandor still lives. A hooded gravedigger matching Sandor's physique appears in A Feast for Crows who could very well be Sandor himself; the character is left unnamed because the chapter is from Brienne's POV, and Brienne has not yet met the Hound in the novels.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ray</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRay</string></dict>
        <key>Sandor Clegane</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.132.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sandor Clegane, nicknamed the Hound, is the younger brother of Ser Gregor Clegane and was the personal bodyguard of Prince Joffrey Baratheon. When Joffrey ascended the Iron Throne as King Joffrey I, Sandor was named into his Kingsguard despite not being a knight himself, but deserted from his post at the Battle of the Blackwater. After traveling as a fugitive with Arya Stark and having a close brush with death, he reluctantly travels with the Brotherhood Without Banners in hope of having a greater purpose.
            Sandor Clegane is a skilled warrior in the service of House Lannister, known primarily for the horrible facial scarring he bears on the right side of his faceÂ and for his fierce demeanor and lack of chivalry. Sandor is the younger brother ofÂ Ser Gregor Clegane, nicknamed "the Mountain", a monstrously huge knight and arguably the most feared man in Westeros. In his youth, Gregor nearly burned off half of Sandor's face because he found Sandor playing with a toy that Gregor had discarded. Sandor didn't even "steal" it, he was merely playing with it and assumed he didn't need Gregor's permission. Without warning or uttering a word, however, Gregor grabbed Sandor and "punished" him by holding his head into a burning brazier. Gregor was only forced to stop after half a dozen servants managed to pry him away from his brother. The incident left severe burn scars over the right half of Sandor's face, thus he usually wears his hair long on that side to cover them. Ever since, Sandor has been deeply afraid of fire.[1]
            Although not as large as his older brother, Sandor is veryÂ large and a formidable fighter in his own right, considered one of the most skilled and dangerous men inÂ Westeros.Â Sandor gutted his first man in combat when he was twelve years old (given the date, this was probably as a young soldier during Robert's Rebellion). Sandor finds killing to be the best thing in the world, and although he isn't a crazed killer who will murder anyone regardless of the law like his brother, he cynically pursues occupations as a bodyguard and soldier which allow him to kill legally--though he scoffs at the hypocrisy of people who think there's really much of a difference. After seeing his brother knighted by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen despite being an infamously dishonorable man, Sandor became jaded with knighthood and developedÂ an extreme contempt for romances and songs which present knights and wars as chivalrous and glorious, knowing all too well that supposedly honorable knights frequently butcher the innocent while claiming glory. Thus, Sandor has steadfastly refused to be knighted or take holy vows.Â Sandor wears a dark set of heavy armor when in battle, and is known to wear a custom helmet shaped like a snarling hound's head, after his family's sigil. He rides a personal warhorse calledÂ Stranger, whose namesake is the seventh and final god in theÂ Faith of the SevenÂ who represents death and the unknown.[2]
            Sandor is part of King Robert Baratheon's retinue when he visits Winterfell in order to offer Eddard Stark the role of Hand of the King. He acts as the bodyguard of Prince Joffrey and is present at the feast held in the King's honor. Robert offers a betrothal between Joffrey and Sansa Stark and Eddard accepts both engagements.[3]
            On the kingsroad back to the capital the royal party reaches the Crossroads Inn. Sandor introduces Sansa to Ser Ilyn Payne, the king's headsman, a fearsome man who had his tongue torn out on the orders of the Mad King many years ago. Joffrey saves Sansa from this unpleasantness and takes her for a walk along the riverbank. Joffrey provokes an argument with the butcher's son Mycah and Sansa's sister Arya and is bitten by Arya's pet dire wolf Nymeria when he attacks them. Joffrey lies about the incident and Sansa supports his version of events. Queen Cersei orders Sansa's dire wolf Lady executed. Sandor chases down and kills Mycah. As Eddard goes to kill Lady he passes the Hound arriving with Mycah's corpse. "He ran. Not very fast." he says as Eddard passes by.[4]
            On his return to King's Landing Sandor stands guard over Joffrey during the tournament held in honor of Eddard's appointment as Hand. Sandor watches distastefully as his brother Gregor kills Ser Hugh of the Vale. Littlefinger tells Sansa that Sandor and Gregor hate one another because, when he was very young, Sandor played with one of Gregor's toys without his elder brother's permission. Gregor held Sandor's face over an open fire, resulting in his hideous burns. They have been enemies ever since.[5]
            Sandor is amused when Gregor is unhorsed in a joust with Ser Loras Tyrell. Gregor attacks Loras and Sandor intervenes. They exchange blows until King Robert orders a halt to the madness. Ser Loras declares Sandor a champion and the smallfolk in the crowd cheer him, to Sandor's surprise and embarrassment.[6]
            King Robert subsequently dies following a hunting accident. Sandor stands guard over King Joffrey as his advisers and vassals swear fealty to him. When Eddard attempts to have Joffrey and Cersei arrested, Sandor joins the Lannister soldiers and men of the City Watch in cutting down Eddard's bodyguards, allowing him to be taken prisoner.[7] Sandor leads a party of Lannister guardsmen to the Red Keep where they slaughter Eddard's entourage and capture Sansa.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sandor_Clegane</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascSandorClegane</string></dict>

        <key>Roose Bolton</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.136.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Roose BoltonÂ was the Lord of the Dreadfort and the head of House Bolton, the former ruling Great House of the North after usurping the position from House Stark. He was the father of Ramsay Bolton, his legitimized bastard, and an unnamed newborn baby from his wife, Walda Frey.
            During the War of the Five Kings, Roose serves King in the North Robb Stark as one of his top generals. However, they disagree quite often due to various tactical and political differences. He later betrays and murders Robb at the Red Wedding after allying with House Frey and House Lannister when the war turns against them. Roose is appointed the new Warden of the North by King Joffrey Baratheon on Tywin Lannister's orders as a reward for killing Robb and ending the conflict. Roose later rebuilds Winterfell and makes it his home and to further strengthen his hold on the North, he has his bastard son Ramsay Bolton legitimized and weds him to Sansa Stark, while he marries Walder Frey's granddaughter, Walda, and impregnates her. After Sansa escapes with Theon Greyjoy, Roose contemplates disinheriting Ramsay for his carelessness in favor of his legitimate baby son, but he is betrayed and murdered by his own son, who goes on to kill Walda and the baby as well.
            Roose Bolton was the head of House Bolton, a vassal family to House Stark of Winterfell. He was the Lord of the Dreadfort. Roose takes pride in his house sigil; the flayed man.
            Although torture is outlawed in the North, his family is famous for flaying the skin from their enemies as a means of torture and execution. Roose fought for Lord Eddard Stark in the civil war against House Targaryen known as Robert's Rebellion and proved his worth as a soldier in the Battle of the Trident. He advised Robert Baratheon to execute Ser Barristan Selmy, a legendary Kingsguard sworn to the Targaryens, but Robert overruled Roose and pardoned Selmy.[1]
            Roose Bolton had a trueborn son, Domeric, by his first wife, who perished, forcing Roose to rely on his bastard son, Ramsay Snow.[2]
            House Bolton banners are present among Robb Stark's forces as they assemble at Winterfell and march south to fight House Lannister following the imprisonment and execution of Lord Eddard Stark.[3][4] Robb is proclaimed King in the North by his bannermen following the death of Eddard, although Roose is not present.[4]
            Roose fights for King Robb Stark in his decisive victory at the Battle of Oxcross. The following morning Roose reports that they killed five Lannister men for every casualty they suffered. He expresses concern over the volume of prisoners they have taken, saying that they are struggling to feed their own men. Robb insists that the prisoners be treated well and rejects Rooseâs suggestion that they torture the officers, reminding him that the Boltons' traditional practice of flaying their enemies is outlawed in the North. Roose warns Robb that the high road is pretty but difficult. Robb counters that he is treating his prisoners as he hopes the Lannisters will treat his sisters.[5]
            They come across a nurse, Talisa Maegyr, and a silent sister treating a wounded Lannister soldier. The healer is preparing to amputate his leg to prevent a wound infection spreading. The soldier is begging her not to proceed but she insists on the necessity of amputation. Roose criticizes her spending time on the Lannister soldiers and she retorts that the Northmen are not her men. Robb helps to restrain the wounded man as she saws off his lower leg.[5]
            He later brings Robb and Catelyn Stark news of Winterfell's fall at the hands of the turncloak Theon Greyjoy. He reports that there is no news of Robb's brothers, but that Ser Rodrik Cassel has been killed. An enraged Robb declares that he must return north to retake his castle and save his brothers, but Roose counters that they have the Lannisters on the retreat, and must continue their offensive. He tells the King that he can have his bastard son, Ramsay Snow, muster several hundred men to retake Winterfell. Robb relents, but orders that the safety of his brothers is paramount. Robb insists that Theon must be brought to him alive so he can inquire as to why he betrayed the North - and so that Robb can execute him personally.[6]
            After the Battle of the Yellow Fork Robb's bannermen gather to hear Queen Regent Cersei Lannister's rejection of their peace terms. They complain that the prison cells are overflowing. Robb leaves the camp with a small force to negotiate the surrender of the Crag.[7] Catelyn releases Jaime Lannister, enraging Robb and his bannermen and resulting in her being placed under guard. Roose meets with Robb to discuss the situation of Winterfell. Robb details a plan to offer mercy to Theon's men so that they will abandon him allowing them to retake the castle with minimal bloodshed. Roose is confident that it will work. Their discussion is interrupted by Talisa and Roose leaves them alone.[8]
            Roose, along with the rest of the Northern host,Â arrives at Harrenhal, finding the ruined castle abandoned and the captives slain, save for a man in maesterÂ robes named Qyburn. While Robb and Talisa attend to the man's injuries, Roose discusses Jaime Lannister's escape with Rickard Karstark, and assures him that the dead will be avenged in time.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Roose_Bolton</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRooseBolton</string></dict>

            Wisdom Rossart was a loyal servant of King Aerys II Targaryen, during whose reign the Guild rose again to royal favor. Rossart burned Aerys's enemies alive in the Great Hall of the Red Keep. During Robert's Rebellion, he rose to Hand of the King.[1]
            Following the Battle of the Trident, Aerys had Rossart fill King's Landing with secret caches of wildfire to destroy the city and all those in it should the capital fall to the rebels. However, Rossart was killed by Ser Jaime Lannister during the capital's sacking to prevent him from carrying out the Mad King's order of destroying the entire city.[2]
            While feverishly taking a bath in Harrenhal alongside Brienne of Tarth, Jaime recalls the turn of events that led him to killing King Aerys, indirectly referring to Rossart as "his pyromancer".[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Wisdom Rossart was the head of the Alchemist's Guild during the reign of Mad King Aerys. He had been elevated largely because he shared the king's passion for fire. He was the pyromancer who had cooked Lord Rickard Stark in his armor with wildfire. After Lord Qarlton Chelsted was burned alive under the Mad King's orders, because he refused to take part in Aerys' plan to destroy the city and tried in vain to dissuade him, Rossart became the new Hand of the King, choosing a burning torch as his personal sigil. Rossart served as Hand for less than a fortnight, before being killed during the Sack of King's Landing. Many people who were not in the capital at the time do not even remember that he was briefly Hand of the King.
            After being sent by Aerys to kill Tywin, Jaime caught up with Rossart and killed him, then he returned to the throne room and killed Aerys. Before he died, Aerys asked him whose blood was on his sword, to which Jaime replied that it was Rossart's. Jaime noted that Rossart at least tried to make a fight of it, while Aerys did not resist at all when Jaime slit his throat. Days later, Jaime hunted down the other pyromancers and slew them as well. Belis offered him gold, and Garigus wept for mercy, but Jaime killed them anyway.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rossart</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRossart</string></dict>
        <key>Robert Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.138.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Robert I Baratheon was the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, formally styled as Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
            Robert, a great warrior and charismatic man in his youth, took the throne through conquest in the war known as Robert's Rebellion, which began when the Prince of Dragonstone, Rhaegar Targaryen, allegedly abducted Robert's betrothed, Lyanna Stark. Killing Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident, his climacticÂ duel turned the tides of the war in his favor. After the war and following Lyanna's death, Robert married Cersei Lannister to cement an alliance with House Lannister to hold the kingdoms together, but the marriage was loveless.
            Robert also had two younger brothers, Stannis and Renly. He and Cersei have three children: Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. However, unbeknownst to Robert and most of the realm, all three were actually fathered by Cersei's twin brother, Jaime Lannister. On the other hand, Robert had many bastards from other women, including Gendry and Barra.
            Robert was the first son of Steffon BaratheonÂ and Cassana Baratheon, and has two younger brothers, Renly and Stannis. Steffon was the head of House Baratheon and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The Stormlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Baratheon is one of the Great Houses of the realm. His parents died in his youth when their ship was caught in a storm; Robert, standing on the walls of Storm's End with Stannis, witnessed his parents ship that was returning from Essos break up on the rocks. He inherited the lordship, and was fostered byÂ Jon Arryn, the head of House Arryn, another Great House. Eddard Stark, the second son of House Stark, was also fostered by Jon Arryn and Robert and Eddard became as close as brothers.[1]
            Robert served King Aerys II Targaryen (known as the Mad King) as the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. Robert was betrothed to Lyanna Stark, Eddard's sister. At the time of their betrothal, Robert beat Richard Lonmouth during the tourney at Harrenhal.
            However, Lyanna was allegedly kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen.[1][2] The Mad King had Eddard's father and brother killed for protesting against the kidnapping.[3] Their deaths sparked a massive uprising against Aerys led by Robert, Eddard and Jon Arryn. Lyanna and Aerys died during the civil war that followed. Robert claimed the Iron Throne because he started the war and killed Prince Rhaegar personally.[4][3] Robert also had the best claim to the throne as a result of being related to the Targaryens through his mother. The other leaders of the rebels, Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark, believed that Robert, with his claim and charismatic personality, should be king and both stood aside. However, due to Tywin Lannister brutally sacking King's Landing and Gregor Clegane murdering Elia Martell and her two children with Rhaegar in cold blood, Robert and Eddard briefly fell out over the former's refusal to make Tywin and Gregor answer for their war crimes.
            Robert was devastated by Lyanna's death, but was urged by Jon Arryn to marry Cersei of House Lannister, making an alliance with her father, Tywin Lannister, who had joined his cause late in the conflict and delivered the capital of King's Landing to him. He named Jon Arryn as his Hand while Eddard took his father's role as Warden of the North.
            Stannis fought for Robert through the war though the two brothers never loved each other.[5][6] Robert tells Eddard Stark "You were the brother I chose." Despite Stannis's service during the war, Robert made Renly the Lord of Storm's End following his victory. Renly was only a child during the war, so he did not fight. Stannis was made Lord of Dragonstone and served on Robert's small council as Master of Ships. Renly later joined the small council as Master of Laws.[7][8]
            Robert has been the King of the Andals and the First Men and the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros since the end of the civil war. However, he was more interested in drinking, whoring and hunting than ruling his kingdom. He revels in the glory days of the rebellion. He leaves running the kingdom largely to his small council, led by Jon Arryn.
            King Robert also loves to throw events such as tournaments at which he spares no expense. Unfortunately, after seventeen years Robert's excesses have left the realm deeply in debt for a shocking six million Gold Dragons, half to House Lannister. He apparently has three children with Cersei: Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. Unbeknownst to Robert, all three were actually fathered by Cersei's twin brother Jaime Lannister.[9] Robert has also fathered several illegitimate bastards, to whom he pays no attention. He has an unacknowledged bastard son named Gendry fathered on a tavern wench.[10] He has an unacknowledged bastard daughter named Barra fathered on the prostitute Mhaegen.[11] He has at least four other unacknowledged bastards fathered with various women in the city of King's Landing alone.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robert_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRobertBaratheon</string></dict>

            During the Andal Invasion of Westeros, the First Men defended the Vale from the invaders, and were united under King Robar, crusing the Andals in battle after battle, reclaiming the Vale from them and driving them back to the Narrow Sea where they had come from.
            The Andals united under Ser Artys Arryn, the Falcon Knight, and the two sides met in battle at the foot of the Giant's Lance in the Battle of the Seven Stars. While the Andals had mounted knights, the First Men were on foot and held the high ground, strengthening their position by lining it with sharpened stakes smeared with offal and excrement. Initially holding against six charges from the Andal cavalry, the line was broken by Torgold Tollett, allowing the knights to rush through the gap.
            However, Robar decided not to retreat, and instead rode after Ser Artys with the intent of scattering the Andal knights by killing their leader. He took the Valyrian steel sword Lady Forlorn from the dead Andal lord Qyle Corbray, and duelled with Ser Artys, a story later celebrated by singers. Robar managed to cut off the Falcon Knight's head, only to see 500 Andal knights behind him, led by Ser Artys himself, who had dressed one of his knights in his spare armor and thus tricked Robar. The knights had taken a goat path known to Ser Artys, and killed King Robar, destroying his forces and ending the rule of the First Men over the Vale.

        <key>Robar Royce</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.140.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Robar Royce was a knight of House Royce and a member of the Kingsguard to King Renly I Baratheon, a claimant to the Iron Throne.
            Robar Royce is a knight of House Royce, a proud and ancient noble family of the Vale of Arryn, and a son of Lord Yohn Royce, the Lord of Runestone. At the onset of the War of the Five Kings, he pledged his allegiance to Renly Baratheon, the Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands.
            King Renly Baratheon's camp is a hive of activity as his troops prepare for the coming battle with the forces of King Stannis Baratheon in darkness. The camp is beset by strong winds. Lady Catelyn Stark meets with King Renly in his command tent.
            Ser Robar and his sworn brother, Ser Emmon Cuy, are outside while Brienne of Tarth stands watch inside the tent. Hearing Brienne scream, the guards rush into the tent with swords in hand. They see Brienne kneeling over Renlyâs corpse and assume that she is responsible. They threaten her life. Catelyn tries to intervene but they push her aside. Brienne fights both of them off, killing them.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Robar Royce is a member of Renly's Rainbow Guard as "Robar the Red", the second son of Lord Yohn Royce of Runestone after Ser Andar Royce and older brother of Waymar Royce of the Night's Watch. He is first seen in King's Landing at the Tourney of the Hand with his father and Ser Andar where he wears steel armor with ancient bronze runes that are supposed to have mystical powers of protection. He unhorses freerider Lothor Brune, but is then defeated by Ser Loras Tyrell.
            When Eddard Stark sends Lord Beric Dondarrion after Ser Gregor Clegane, who is terrorizing the Riverlands, Ser Robar is sent to the Kingswood to inform the King who is hunting with others, including Lord Yohn Royce.
            In Renly's camp he tells Catelyn Stark as he escorts her to the sept that the reason that he had joined Renly was to seek the glory he would never find as the second son of a noble house and he was weary of being in tournaments. Catelyn Stark guesses him to be about 21 years old. When Renly names him to his Rainbow Guard he names him the red knight Robar the Red. At the feast at Bitterbridge, Ser Bryce Caron dares him to juggle daggers.
            When Renly is murdered, Brienne's scream causes Ser Robar and Ser Emmon Cuy and two guards to rush into the tent. They arrive just after Renly's assassination to find Brienne bending over his body and covered in his blood. Cuy blames Brienne for the death and he and the other two guards attack her. Catelyn Stark convinces Robar that Brienne is innocent. He tells Lady Catelyn to get her away and he fights off the men-at-arms that follow Cuy, while Catelyn uses an iron brazier to knock Emmon Cuy unconscious, then she and Brienne escape. Ser Robar and Ser Emmon are subsequently killed in a fit of rage by their Lord Commander, Ser Loras Tyrell, for their failure to protect their king.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robar_Royce</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRobarRoyce</string></dict>

            Rogar Bolton was the the last head of House Bolton who ruled as a petty king. He bent the knee to House Stark, forswearing the practice of flaying as a sign of allegiance to his new king.[1]
            According to the World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014), Rogar Bolton was the last of the Red Kings of House Bolton, who ruled their own independent kingdom in the eastern parts of what later became "the North", and vied with the Starks for control over the rest of it. Rogar Bolton submitted to the Starks just as the Andal Invasion was beginning in southern Westeros, meaning that he lived roughly 6,000 years ago.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rogar_Bolton</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRogarBolton</string></dict>

        <key>Robett Glover</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.143.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Robett Glover is the Lord of Deepwood Motte and head of House Glover after the death of his brother, Galbart Glover, during the War of the Five Kings. He is the third to declare Jon Snow the King in the North after apologizing to him for not fighting for House Stark during the Battle of the Bastards.
            Robett is the brother of Galbart Glover, the Lord of Deepwood Motte. He succeeded him after Galbart's death in the War of the Five Kings.
            Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, and Davos Seaworth secretly meet with Robett to try and gain his support against House Bolton. He refuses to help, as they have only secured the loyalty of House Mormont, and citing that Jon Snow has joined forces with wildlings, whereas the Boltons helped Robett take Deepwood Motte back from the Ironborn, who had captured it and terrorized Robett's family and subjects. He lambastes Robb Stark, to whom House Glover was sworn, for giving no such help (though in all irony, this was Robb's original intention, but he was persuaded otherwise by Roose Bolton) and "taking up with a foreign whore", ruining his political alliances, thus costing the North the entire war and getting all of his men killed along with him at the Red Wedding. Despite the protestations of Jon and Sansa, Robett refuses to declare for them, and sends them away empty-handed.[1]
            Robett, along with other Northern lords, travels to Winterfell following the defeat of the Boltons at the Battle of the Bastards, where he and two other lords, Wyman Manderly and Cley Cerwyn, are berated by Lady Lyanna Mormont for refusing to help the Stark cause. Robett is the second lord, after Lord Wyman, to declare Jon King in the North. He apologizes for not participating in the battle, and pledges his allegiance to House Stark and Jon Snow.[2]
            He is later present when Jon convenes another meeting at Winterfell. There, Robett reads Samwell Tarly's letter regarding the vast amount of dragonglass and is informed of Daenerys Targaryen's letter regarding the fact that it would be wise if Jon would bend the knee. Despite the wishes of Robett and other noble lords, Jon still departs Winterfell, leaving Sansa in control of the North.[4]
            While Jon Snow is preoccupied on Dragonstone with Daenerys and mining the dragon glass, Lord Glover and Lord Yohn Royce propose that the Regent Sansa take over as ruler of the North. Sansa rejects their proposal and stresses that she is only a Regent. Sansa's younger sister Arya Stark then suggests killing the troublesome lords but is rebuffed by Sansa.[5]
            InÂ A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Robett Glover is brother of Galbart Glover, the head ofÂ House GloverÂ of Deepwood Motte. He is described as tall and haggard and has brown-grey hair.
            Robett has two children, Gawen and Erena. There is no mentioning in the books that he has any grandchildren.
            WhenÂ Robb StarkÂ calls his banners, both Robett and his brotherÂ GalbartÂ ride out from Deepwood Motte, leaving it in the hands of Robett's wife,Â Sybelle. Later it is taken by Asha Greyjoy (named Yara Greyjoy in the show).
            As result of the agreement reached between Vargo Hoat and Roose Bolton, Robett and SerÂ Aenys FreyÂ lead a group of northern knights that Vargo brings into Harrenhal, under the pretense that they are captives taken by the Brave Companions. As part of the feint, the northerners are chained, in ragged clothes and many fake injuries. SerÂ Amory Lorch, left by Lord Tywin as castellan of Harrenhal, falls for the trick. Arya Stark, not realizing what is going on, organizes a successful liberation of the captives with the assistance ofÂ Jaqen H'ghar,Â BiterÂ andÂ Rorge.
            After Roose takes over Harrenhall, he orders Robett to join up with SerÂ Helman TallhartÂ and march onÂ Duskendale. They obey, unaware that Roose deliberately sends them into a trap: the joined forces of Randyll Tarly and the Mountain destroy the northmen troops. SerÂ Helman is killed, while Robett and Harrion Karstark (the last surviving son of Rickard Karstark) are taken captive.
            Robb exchanges the captive Martyn Lannister (who was not killed by Rickard Karstark in the books) for Robett. Robett arrives inÂ White HarborÂ after the prisoner exchange and tries to raise men in the city to retake Deepwood Motte from the ironborn. He is unsuccessful, however, because Lord Wyman Manderly has grown weary of war - secretly, because the Manderlys are feigning peace so they can later turn on the Boltons and Freys. As it turns out, Stannis Baratheon marches south and liberates Deepwood Motte, retaking it from the ironborn and freeing Robett's wife. However, their children Gawen and Erena are still in the hands of the Ironborn; being looked after by Asha's aunts at The Ten Towers in the Iron Islands. Robett himself remains at White Harbor but may have coordinated with his wife via messenger-raven. At Deepwood Motte itself, Robett's wife commands the remaining Glover forces to openly join Stannis's army, along with several hunters and trackers from their vassal Houses in the Wolfswood such as House Forrester.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robett_Glover</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRobettGlover</string></dict>
        <key>Robin Arryn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.144.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Robin Arryn, commonly called "Sweetrobin" by his mother, is the only surviving child and heir of Lord Jon Arryn by his wife, Lysa of House Tully. He is the Lord of the Eyrie, the head of House Arryn, the Warden of the East and Lord Paramount of the Vale of Arryn. His mother was killed byÂ Petyr Baelish when he unexpectedly pushed her out of the Moon Door, falling hundreds of feet to her death. Petyr was left the Lord Protector of the Vale until his execution, leaving Robin the sole ruler of the Vale until another Lord Protector is chosen.
            Robin was born in King's Landing where his father was serving as the Hand of the King for Robert Baratheon. Jon begins an investigation into Robert's legitimate and bastard children and then takes a fever and dies suddenly. Robin then inherits Jon's position. Lysa rushes Robin back to the Eyrie following Jon's death.[1] She writes to her sister to accuse House Lannister of poisoning Jon.[2] LysaÂ was fiercely protective of Robin hence he has led an extremely sheltered life.[3]
            Catelyn Stark brings the captive Tyrion Lannister to the Eyrie. Catelyn has arrested him on suspicion of involvement in the attempted assassination of her son Bran and expects Lysa's support given her earlier accusation. She is shocked to see that Lysa still breastfeeds Robin, despite him being so old. Robin is prone to fits of histrionics, demanding to see "the bad man fly".Â Lysa calls him a strong and mighty ruler, worthy of the Vale's leadership, but Catelyn appears skeptical.[4]
            Tyrion agrees to confess to his crimes and is brought before the High Seat. He presents a list of minor misdemeanors from childhood, though Robin is particularly intrigued by some of them. Tyrion demands a trial by combat to prove his innocence and calls upon his brother Jaime Lannister to be his champion, even though getting word to Jaime and his arrival would take many days. When his request is refused, the mercenary Bronn agrees to be his champion, much to Tyrion's surprise and relief. Bronn triumphs against Lysa's champion, Ser Vardis Egen, and he and Tyrion are allowed to go free. Robin is disappointed at being deprived of an execution by Moon Door.[5]
            Catelyn visits Robin and Lysa before leaving the Vale to join her son Robb's army. She asks Lysa to commit the Vale to the war on the side of the Starks and Tullys, but Lysa refuses, saying the Vale's knights are needed at home to defend Robin.[6]
            Robin receives his new stepfather, Petyr Baelish, and his cousin Sansa Stark at the Eyrie. Robin takes temporary delight in the gift Petyr brings him - a falcon, finely carved from crystal - before throwing it out the Moon Door to demonstrate the Door's nature to Sansa. Lysa seems to have allowed him some freedom since Littlefinger's arrival, as she allowed him out of her sight to show Sansa around.[7]
            Later, he visits Sansa in the courtyard of the Eyrie while she is building a snow castle of Winterfell. When he suggests they add a Moon Door to it, he accidentally knocks over one of the towers that Sansa has built. At first, she gently scolds him, but as he grows petulant, insisting that he didn't ruin it, Sansa is driven to slap him across the face. He then runs back into the castle. Later on, his mother is killed when she's pushed out of Robin's favorite plaything, theÂ Moon Door,Â byÂ Petyr Baelish.[8]
            Littlefinger urges two Lords of the Vale, Lord Yohn Royce and Lady Anya Waynwood, to back Lord Robin Arryn against the Lannisters, and makes an arrangement with them so that Robin finally leaves the Eyrie and conducts an official tour of his lands. Later, Robin prepares to depart, but admits that he is afraid to abandon the safety of the Eyrie. However, Petyr urges him not to worry about his death but about his life. He tells Robin that taking charge of his own life is what being the Lord of the Vale really means.[9]
            Robin begins sparring lessons, under the supervision of Lord Yohn Royce. Due to his frail condition and sheltered childhood, Robin's attempts at swordsmanship are quite pitiful for a boy of his age. Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark leave Robin behind to be fostered at Runestone under Royce's tutelage, who assures them of their Lord's safety, though he makes no promises that Robin will become a swordsman.[10]
            Robin is practicing archery at Runestone under the tutelage of Lord Yohn Royce, although he seems to have as much success with the bow as he does with the sword. He is excited upon the arrival of Petyr Baelish, whom he refers to as Uncle Petyr, and is captivated by his present of a rare gyrfalcon. He offers to send Lord Yohn flying for treason when Petyr casts aspersions on Yohn's loyalty, but allows him leniency upon Petyr's recommendation. He decides that the Vale armies should go north to defend his cousin, Sansa Stark, from House Bolton.[11]
            For the bulk of his life, Robin was shamelessly spoiled by his delusional, paranoid mother, and this resulted in him possessing few of the traits expected of the heir to a powerful noble house; aside from showing precious little tact or other courtly social skills, Robin became extremely temperamental, prone to hysterical fits and violent tempers. He also appears hugely entertained by the prospect of throwing prisoners and enemies through the Moon Door, giggling and clapping excitedly when it was opened for Tyrion Lannister. In that same vein, he appeared disappointed when robbed of the opportunity to see Tyrion executed. These traits do not make Robin psychopathic or sadistic to the standards of Joffrey Baratheon or Ramsay Bolton; he simply felt safe knowing that he could just send any problem that came his way plummeting to its death. Lysa's unnatural doting over her son did not go unnoticed by the boyâs father Jon Arryn, who was only obstructed from doing anything about it by Lysa's extreme overprotectiveness.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robin_Arryn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRobinArryn</string></dict>
        <key>Ronnel Arryn </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.145.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ronnel Arryn was the last King of the Mountain and the Vale.
            King Ronnel Arryn was only a child during the War of Conquest, with his mother, Queen Sharra Arryn ruling the Vale as Regent. When Visenya Targaryen flew to the Eyrie demanding submission, Ronnel bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror and surrendered the Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale in exchange for a ride atop Vhagar.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, it was Queen Sharra who surrendered the Kingdom when she found Ronnel sitting on Visenya's lap, both atop Vhagar, and he asked her if he could ride the dragon.
            The Vale actually put up a fairly strong resistance during the War of Conquest. After the initial Targaryen landing at the mouth of the Blackwater River, the three siblings along with their dragons split up to pursue three separate objectives: Aegon would attack Harrenhal to the west, Rhaenys and Orys would attack Storm's End to the south. Meanwhile, Visenya would lead the Targaryen navy to make an amphibious landing in the east of the Vale - given that it would have been suicidal to try to lead a land army through the narrow pass through the Mountains of the Moon that seal its western border (a pass known as the "Bloody Gate"). However, their fleet was intercepted by the Arryn fleet, and the resulting Battle of Gulltown was the worst setback the Targaryens suffered during their invasion of Westeros (Aegon did later withdraw from Dorne, but only after guerrilla resistance convinced him it would be too difficult to hold, not a disastrous pitched battle). The entire Targaryen fleet was destroyed in the battle. Visenya did what she could to salvage the situation by using her dragon Vhagar to destroy all of the remaining Arryn ships, but even so, the Targaryens no longer had a fleet to quickly reposition troops along the coasts, so the rest of their conquests had to be fought by land.
            The Vale also lost its ability to move troops across the water, but rather than try to unite with the anti-Targaryen alliance before formed between the Reach and the Westerlands, Sharra adopted a siege strategy, closing the Bloody Gate and positioning her land armies to massacre the Targaryen army if it tried to force the mountain pass. The result was that the strength of the Vale was not present at the Field of Fire, though it is uncertain if this would have affected its outcome. Similar to how Aegon faced the same mentality at Harrenhal but simply flew over the castle walls, after the Field of Fire Visenya decided to simply fly her dragon over the mountains and directly to the Eyrie. Instead of immediately attacking the castle, however, the implicit threat alone was enough to makeÂ Sharra surrender.
            VisenyaÂ was true to her word: the Arryns retained their control over the Vale, and she took Ronnel up for a flight on Vhagar.
            After Aegon I died in 37 AL he was succeeded by his son Aenys Targaryen, but many considered him a weakling and opportunistic rebellions broke out throughout the Seven Kingdoms. In the Vale, Ronnel's younger brother Jonos staged a coup, imprisoned Ronnel in the Eyrie's dungeons, and declared the Vale independent again, with himself as its king. Aenys was slow to respond, but the armies of House Royce rose up to besiege Jonos in the Eyrie - they felt that Jonos would not succeed and hoped to curry favor with the Targaryens. In response, Jonos had Ronnel executed by throwing him out the Moon Door, which added a dark twist to his nickname, the "King who flew". Aegon's younger son Maegor later arrived at the Eyrie on his father's dragon, Balerion, and put down the rebellion. Jonos and his followers were all executed. Both Ronnel and Jonos died without surviving heirs, so rule of the Vale passed to their cousin Hubert Arryn, who was married to a lady of House Royce - after Jonos executed Ronnel the Royce army besieging the Eyrie had already started supporting Hubert as an alternative to Jonos. As a result, later generations of House Arryn actually do not directly descend from Ronnel, but from his cousin Hubert.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ronnel_Arryn_(King)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRonnelArryn</string></dict>
        <key>Ryger Rivers</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.146.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ryger Rivers was a bastard son of Lord Walder Frey, the head of House Frey and Lord of the Crossing.
            Ryger is present when Catelyn Stark visits Lord Walder Frey to negotiate passage for her son's army across the Trident. Like his trueborn half-brother, Stevron Frey, Ryger admonishes his father to remember his courtesies. Lord Frey rudely dismisses his son and reminds him that he's a bastard born of a milkmaid.[1]
            He is presumably poisoned by Arya Stark, in retaliation for the Red Wedding.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ryger is a natural son of Lord Walder Frey and a woman who milked goats. He is described as being younger than Stevron Frey, who is 65 years old.
            Catelyn's chapter in the first book, in which she enters the Twins to request that Lord Walder grant Robb's army passage over the river, is the only point that Ryger Rivers has appeared in the narrative so far. The dialogue in this scene matched the books fairly closely.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ryger_Rivers</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRygerRivers</string></dict>
        <key>Rickard Morgryn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.147.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rickard Morgryn is a merchant lord working in King's Landing. He initially serves as an ambassador for House Whitehill, negotiating a deal to sell ironwood to the crown. However, he is later pushed out of the deal by his partner, Andros.
            Morgryn is known for being a dangerous man. He introduced Andros to Lord Ludd Whitehill, and is a well-known merchant in the ironwood business. He is also an eligible bachelor.
            Morgryn was sent along with Andros by Lord Ludd Whitehill to King's Landing in order to negotiate a sell of ironwood with Tyrion Lannister. After an hour of waiting in the Red Keep, the two ambassadors were introduced to Mira Forrester, much to their surpise. Morgryn urged Andros to be polite after the latter became angry over Mira's presence, and continued to try to calm Andros to no avail. Tyrion ended his meeting with the two ambassadors in order to deal directly with Mira, and Morgryn asked him to reconsider their arrangement before leaving.[1]
            Morgryn was invited to the royal wedding. While there, he converses with Lord Garibald Tarwick and later prevented Lucan from detaining Mira by bumping into Lucan, causing his wine to spill on his shirt, and ordered Mira to help him clean up and threatened Lucan's job. Morgryn is impressed that she stole the ironwood deal, then warned her that Tyrion was trying to play House Forrester and House Whitehill against each other in order to secure the cheapest possible price for the ironwood. He began to offer his alliance with Mira, but they are interrupted by the assassination of King Joffrey Baratheon and the arrest of Tyrion. Morgryn quickly leaves the scene, telling Mira to get the ironwood decree from Tyrion's chambers if she wished to forge an alliance with him.[2]
            Morgryn attends Tommen's Coronation Feast in this episode. Morgryn is seen arguing with Andros by Mira when she sneaks in with the help of her friend. Morgryn will move over to a new group of friends, dissuading them from their initial curiosity as to why he is no longer in the Ironwood business. Morgryn dismisses their theories, saying that he simply has no more interest in it. However, this proves to be false when Mira overhears Andros discussing his partnership with House Whitehill. Morgryn is confronted by Mira with this information, and he admits that he was pushed out of the business when Whitehill took Andros upon as an exclusive dealer. Morgryn holds disdain for Andros for this, and this is apparent when Mira later argues with Andros, and Morgryn compliments her on getting him so angry. While Morgryn seemed both surprised and pleased that Mira destroyed her contract with Tyrion without being detected, the proposed deal they had is now nullified now that he isn't in the ironwood business.
            Mira can eavesdrop on Morgryn's conversation, and learn that Morgryn is single. If so desired, the player can also have Mira ask about him to Tarwick. Tarwick will reveal that while he is handsome, he also has an unexplained reputation of being dangerous.[3]
            When Mira was chased by Lannister guards, she seeks refugee with Morgryn. He bribes the guards and invites her into his litter. He reveals that it was him who hired Ser Damien to kill her, since she got in his way of Ironwood trade. He then tossed her out and handed her over to Lucan.
            Morgryn later comes to Mira's cell, with the offer of wedding Mira so he could have a claim on Ironrath and the Ironwood, as her family was about to be exterminated by the Whitehills. Mira can either agree with his proposal, becoming his wife and have Tom executed in her stead, or face execution herself.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rickard_Morgryn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRickardMorgryn</string></dict>

            Riddell is a member of theÂ Brotherhood Without Banners. It is not clear whether he was one of the rogue members, but it is possible as he is in the company ofÂ GatinsÂ and not with the main group.
            Gatins is bragging about what an excellent kisser he is and asks Steve andÂ RiddellÂ if they want to learn.Â Riddell watches closely as Gatins begins to demonstrate on Steve, which turns into a prank. Riddell and the others see Sandor Clegane walking up behind Steve, whom the Hound beheads. Before Riddell can run, he is impaled in the chest by the Hound.[1]
            In theÂ A Song of Ice and FireÂ novels, there is no character named Riddell.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Riddell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRiddell</string></dict>
        <key>Renly Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.149.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Renly I Baratheon was the youngest of three brothers and thus fourth in line to inherit the throne after Joffrey, Tommen, and Stannis. He was granted the title of Lord Paramount of the Stormlands by his brother Robert, whose small council he also served on as Master of Laws, but abandoned the latter position when laying claim to the Iron Throne, styling himself as Renly of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. Margaery Tyrell became Renly's queen when she married him in an alliance; however, it was her brother Loras whom he truly loved. During talks of an alliance with the Starks, his reign abruptly ended when a Shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon killed Renly inside his tent. This led most of his bannermen from the Stormlands and some of the Reach to submit to his older brother Stannis as their new king.
            Renly is the third and youngest son of SteffonÂ and CassanaÂ Baratheon. Steffon was the head of House Baratheon and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The Stormlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Baratheon is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Renly has two older brothers Robert and Stannis. Their parents died when the boys were young and Robert inherited his father's titles. Robert led a rebellion against King Aerys II Targaryen, deposing and replacing him as the King on the Iron Throne. He made Renly the Lord of Storm's End following his victory. Renly was only a child during the civil war, so he did not fight.[1][2]
            Renly serves Robert as Master of Laws on the King's small council in King's Landing. He is fourth in line to the throne, behind his nephews Joffrey and Tommen and his older brother Stannis. Renly is popular at court because of his friendly manner and keen fashion sense.[3]
            Renly has been involved in a homosexual romance with Ser Loras Tyrell for many years. They must keep their love a secret because the dominant religion of the realm, the Faith of the Seven, considers homosexuality to be a sin, although many people are nonetheless aware of their relationship as something of an open secret.[4]
            Renly greets Eddard Stark, whom he knew when younger, upon his arrival at King's Landing. Renly is the only member of the small council whom Eddard greets warmly. Renly agrees with Eddard's assessment that his brother Robert's profligate spending is damaging the realm.[5]
            Renly irritates Commander Janos Slynt by questioning his competence to command the City Watch if he cannot keep the peace.[6] Renly bets on his not-so-secret lover, Ser Loras Tyrell, to win a joust against Ser Gregor Clegane. He wins a significant sum of money from Littlefinger, then they mock each other. Renly asks Littlefinger if he has a friend; Littlefinger retorts by asking when Renly will be having his friend, pointing at Loras. Later, in the small council, Renly supports Robert's proposed assassination of Daenerys Targaryen. Loras suggests that Renly claim the Iron Throne for himself and offers the support of the rich and powerful House Tyrell. Renly points out that he is fourth in line to the throne, behind his two nephews and his older brother, Stannis. Loras counters that Robert claimed the throne through strength of arms alone and asserts that the realm will not follow Joffrey because he is a monster, Tommen because he is too young, or Stannis who "has the personality of a lobster".[4]
            Renly goes hunting with Robert and his retinue. He quarrels with Robert over his glorification of warfare and Robert's needling him about how many girls he has slept with; in Robert's words "simpler times" which were in fact more bloody than he is willing to admit. Robert is later fatally gored by a boar off screen.[1]
            As Robert lays dying Renly suggests to Eddard that they take Joffrey prisoner and hold him hostage to neutralize House Lannister and allow Renly to seize the throne. Eddard believes this to be treason, he instead supports Stannis' claim to the throne. Eddard says he will not dishonor Robert's final hours by taking children prisoner and shedding blood in the castle. Later, Eddard hears from Varys that Renly and Loras have fled the city with some fifty retainers.[7]
            At the Lannister camp, Kevan reports that both Renly and Stannis have laid claim to the throne. Elsewhere, Robb Stark rejects Jonos Bracken's suggestion they side with Renly and is instead declared King in the North by his bannermen.[8]
            Before the Battle of Oxcross, two Lannister sentries argue who is the greatest swordsman in Westeros. Rennick says that Ser Loras Tyrell can't be a great swordsman as he has been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years and Renly's not dead.[9]
            Renly is crowned King with the support of the powerful House Tyrell of Highgarden. He gathers an army of 100,000 men from across the Reach and the Stormlands.[10] He solidifies his alliance with House Tyrell by marrying Margaery Tyrell, the sister of his lover Loras Tyrell.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Renly_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRenlyBaratheon</string></dict>
        <key>Rickard Karstark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.150.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Rickard KarstarkÂ was the Lord of Karhold and the head of House Karstark, a vassal of House Stark.
            Rickard Karstark is the Lord of Karhold and the head of House Karstark, a vassal family to House Stark of Winterfell. He is a close ally and distant relation of House Stark.[1] He has three sons, Torrhen Karstark[2], Harrion Karstark[3], and Harald Karstark, and one granddaughter, Alys Karstark.
            Lord Karstark listens to the debate between Robb Stark, Jonos Bracken and Greatjon Umber about whether they should join forces with Renly or Stannis Baratheon. When the Greatjon names Robb as the King in the North and lays his sword at his feet, Karstark is the second to join him, saying he'll have peace on those terms.[4]
            Rickard Karstark is among Robb Stark's host in the Westerlands and is present when Alton Lannister gives Queen Cersei Lannister's response to Robb's peace terms. Karstark's son Torrhen Karstark is later killed by Jaime Lannister during an escape attempt. After Jaime's recapture, Lord Rickard demands Jaime's execution in revenge for the murder of his son, but Catelyn Stark speaks for his life. After Lord Rickard's threatening reaction, she reminds him that he has sworn an oath of loyalty to Robb Stark and that Jaime is a prisoner of war. She says that he should remember who his king is and who she is. She promises him that Jaime will be punished for what he did. Reluctantly Lord Karstark gives in, but demands retribution when his King returns from The Crag. During the confrontation with Lady Catelyn, Lord Rickard also dismisses Talisa Maegyr as a "foreign bitch".[2]
            Catelyn sends Jaime to King's Landing with her sworn sword Brienne to exchange him for her captive daughters, fearing that Rickard or his men will kill him if he remains in the camp. He is furious that she has denied him his vengeance and rejects her argument that Jaime may yet save the lives of her children, adding that he personally would happily exchange his life for those of his deceased children, Torrhen and Harrion, even if it meant captivity for them. Robb tells Catelyn that she has betrayed him and orders her kept under guard.[5]
            Rickard's faith in Robb continues to deteriorate as the Northern host arrives at Harrenhal, finding the castle's inhabitants had been put to the sword. Roose Bolton attempts to reassure Rickard, telling him that he has sent his best hunter in pursuit of the Kingslayer, and that the dead will be avenged in time. Karstark, however, is clearly unconvinced.[6]
            Lord Karstark manifests his disapproval of the march to Riverrun for the funerals of Lord Hoster Tully, grandfather of his King, considering it a distraction from the war effort. When questioned by Robb if he has lost faith in the Northern cause, Lord Karstark insists that if the cause is revenge he will keep faith "until it snows in Dorne", but adds that he believes Robb lost the war the day he married Talisa Maegyr.[7]
            Rickard KarstarkÂ and his men killÂ MartynÂ andÂ Willem LannisterÂ in the dungeons of RiverrunÂ and are brought before Robb Stark. He openly insults the King in the North and claims the war is a lost cause.Â Remaining true to his honor just like his father, Robb decides that Lord KarstarkÂ must die for his treason. Though Edmure Tully, Talisa, and Catelyn attempt to advise Robb to hold Karstark hostage and send him to the Night's Watch after the war - on the basis that the Karstarks form a significant portion of Robb's army, and they will abandon Robb if he executes their lord. Despite the warnings of all of his councilors, Robb refuses to listen.
            In the meantime, while he is being tortured in the Dreadfort, Theon Greyjoy incorrectly assumes Ramsay Snow to be Rickard's son, keeping him prisoner on Rickard's orders, since he is Robb's bannerman, remaining unaware that Rickard has been executed.
            Rickard is mentioned by his last living son Harald Karstark when he meets with the BoltonsÂ at Winterfell. Harald makes it clear that his house will never support the Starks again after Robb executed his father. Despite the fact that Roose avenged his father by killing Robb at the Red Wedding, Harald makes no attempt to intervene when Ramsay kills Roose after the birth of his half-brother, whom Ramsay also murders along with his stepmother, Walda Bolton.[9]
            While planning to counter the Boltons' claim to the North, Sansa Stark expresses her belief that the Karstarks will support them when they learn of Jon Snow's resurrection, but Ser Davos Seaworth reminds her that Rickard was executed by Robb, which is likely why Rickard's last surviving son has sided with the Starks' enemies and not out of ignorance as Sansa had hoped.[10]
            
            Originally Vinnie McCabe had been announced in the role of Rickard Karstark, however he turned out to be playing a Lannister bannerman, Leo Lefford, in the same episode as Karstark's debut. Steven Blount appeared as a Stark bannerman in "Fire and Blood."[4] Blount's character was given lines spoken by Rickard Karstark in the book and his CV lists him as playing Lord Karstark.[11] For the second season it was announced that John Stahl was playing Rickard Karstark.[12] Stahl was named on screen as Lord Karstark in "A Man Without Honor."[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rickard_Karstark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRickardKarstark</string></dict>
        <key>Raymun Redbeard</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.151.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Raymun Redbeard was a King-Beyond-the-Wall of the Free Folk, living roughly a hundred years ago.
            Raymun Redbeard assumed the title of King-Beyond-the-Wall and led an invasion of the North. He figured that the Wall's massive size was both its greatest advantage and its greatest flaw, making it impossible to patrol the entire fortification day and night. So when the patrols passed, he sent his climbers to scale the Wall and leave ropes and ladders for his army to follow after.
            The Night's Watch did not even know of his passing until his force was already cornered and destroyed by the combined efforts of House Stark and House Umber.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Raymun Redbeard was King-Beyond-the-Wall in the time of Lord William Stark, the grandfather of Lord Rickard Stark. Having seen the decline of the Night's Watch under the leadership of Lord Commander Jack Musgood, Raymun and his raiders crossed over the Wall and invaded the North. Eventually, the invading force engaged in battle against the Northerners led by William Stark and Lord Harmond of House Umber, "the Drunken Giant". Lord William was slain and his younger brother, Artos Stark, "the Implacable", slew Raymun. Raymun's younger brother fled back beyond the Wall and became known as "the Red Raven", for having fled from battle, "Red" for the color of his hair and "Raven" because it rhymed with "craven".
            The Night's Watch arrived too late to fight so Artos, grieving over the headless corpse of his brother, assigned them the shameful task of burying the dead. Lord Commander Musgood was forever after known as "Sleepy Jack".
            The wildling raider Gerrick Kingsblood boasts direct descent from Raymun Redbeard but is actually descended from the Red Raven, a fact most Free Folk are aware of and use to disparage him.
            The Tales of Dunk and Egg prequel novellas begin in 209 AL, and while the three currently published ones only extend to the year 211 AL, future installments are intended to stretch forward to over the next fifty years of history, using time jumps. Raymund Redbeard led his attack over the Wall in 226 AL, meaning that he is the current King-Beyond-The-Wall during the Tales of Dunk and Egg era, and that he might appear in any potential live-action adaptation of the prequels.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Raymun_Redbeard</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRaymunRedbeard</string></dict>

        <key>Rakharo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.153.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rakharo was a loyal Dothraki bodyguard to Daenerys Targaryen. Following the birth of her dragons he was named a bloodrider by his Khaleesi. He was killed by a rival khalasar while scouting the Red Waste.
            Rakharo is a Dothraki warrior who is skilled in combat. He is young, but extremely capable in battle. He was trained by his father, who was a bloodrider in the retinue of a famous khal, Khal Bharbo. He is descended from a long line of bloodriders. He protected Daenerys from her brother's vicious temper and was one of the first to declare her "blood of my blood."[1]
            Khal Drogo assigns Rakharo to be the bodyguard of Daenerys Targaryen, Drogo's khaleesi. Their marriage was brokered by her brother Viserys in exchange for Drogo's assistance in reclaiming the Iron Throne for House Targaryen. Drogo takes the khalasar east to Vaes Dothrak. Rakharo discreetly follows Daenerys when she briefly leaves the column to walk in some nearby trees and witnesses her brother Viserys unleashing his rage upon her. Rakharo disables Viserys by whipping him around the throat. At Daenerys's request he spares Viserys, but forces him to walk back to the khalasar by taking his horse. Later, he and Ser Jorah Mormont discuss the relative merits of Dothraki and Westerosi weapons and armor before he gets into a petty argument with Daenerys's handmaiden Irri over what to prepare for dinner. Irri reveals that Daenerys is pregnant and demands the slaughter of a goat.[2]
            Viserys continues to press Drogo to fulfil his promise immediately and drunkenly threatens Daenerys in front of the khalasar. Rakharo watches as Drogo kills Viserys using a crown of molten gold.[3] Rakharo apprehends an assassin who attempts to poison Daenerys in the markets of Vaes Dothrak after he is exposed by Ser Jorah.[4]
            The assassination attempt causes Drogo to vow to take the Iron Throne for Daenerys. He takes the khalasar south to raid the Lhazareen people to obtain slaves in order to fund the invasion. Rakharo accompanies Daenerys during the Khalasar's raid on a Lhazareen village. Daenerys objects to the dothraki's treatment of the slaves. Rakharo stops the dothraki raping the women. Daenerys' actions provoke dissent and lead to a fight between Drogo and Mago. Drogo easily kills Mago but allows Mago to inflict a small wound while initiating the fight.[5] Drogo's wound festers and he falls from his horse during the journey to sell the Lhazareen slaves. Rakharo stays loyal to Daenerys and carries out her commands even when the other Dothraki begin to blame her for Drogo's decline into illness. Qotho attacks Daenerys and Jorah intervenes, killing Qotho. Daenerys goes into premature labor.[6] Daenerys son dies and Drogo is left in a vegetative state. The Lhazareen maegi Mirri Maz Duur takes responsibility. Daenerys ends Drogo's misery and then builds a funeral pyre for him. She orders Rakharo to place her dragon eggs on the pyre and Jorah to bind Duur within the flames. Daenerys steps into the inferno as her people watch. They stand vigil through the night and in the morning they find her amongst the ashes with three newly hatched dragons. Rakharo joins Ser Jorah in declaring his loyalty to her.[7]
            Rakharo becomes one of Daenerys bloodriders along with Aggo and Kovarro. Daenerys leads what remains of her khalasar deep into the Red Waste to avoid attack from rival khalasars or retribution from the Lhazareen. Facing starvation she sends Rakharo, Aggo and Kovarro to scout in three different directions, using the last remaining horses. Rakharo is sent North East. Daenerys says goodbye to him personally and tells him that he has never failed her. He says that it is a bad time to start.[8]
            Rakharo's horse returns to the khalasar without him. Jorah Mormont approaches the horse to find Rakharo's decapitated head in a bag (along with his cut braid of hair, to mark his defeat), speculating he might have been killed by Khals Pono or Jhaqo to show their contempt for a female leading a khalasar. Irri, who was in love with Rakharo[1], is distraught because, according to Dothraki belief, his spirit won't be able to move on to the Night Lands - the afterlife - to ride with his ancestors.[9]
            In discussing the ending of Season 4, David Benioff and Dan Weiss revealed that they did not want to kill off Rakharo, but that the actor was planning to leave the show for other projects anyway. Rather than have his character simply disappear, they decided to give him a proper send-off.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Jhogo is sixteen years old at the start of the series and favors a combination of the whip and arakh in battle. He is a warrior in Khal Drogo's khalasar and is assigned to Daenerys Targaryen as bodyguard by her new husband.
            The character of Rakharo is similar, but is older and more seasoned than Jhogo. He has a long, curving mustache and wields the arakh alone in combat. Based on his repeated use of the whip, the Rakharo of the TV series appears to be predominantly based on the Jhogo character from the books.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rakharo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRakharo</string></dict>
        <key>Ralf Kenning</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.154.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ralf KenningÂ was an Ironborn raider and a member of House Kenning.
            Kenning is the commander of the ironborn garrison at Moat Cailin.
            When Theon Greyjoy enters Moat Cailin to discuss terms of surrender, Kenning asks him why is marching with House Bolton. Theon informs him that the Boltons took him hostage after the Sack of Winterfell and sent him to treat with Kenning in good faith as his fellow ironborn. Theon gives a message from Roose Bolton imploring the ironborn to surrender due to the overwhelming odds against them, promising them justice and safe passage to the Stony Shore. Kenning is hesitant and Theon recalls seeing his own father bend the knee to Robert Baratheon after his rebellion failed, insisting that there was no shame in it nor any honor lost. The ailing Kenning collapses and is helped up by his men. He spits at Theon and mocks him as a whipped dog, stating that the ironborn will not surrender. Kenning is then killed byÂ Adrack Humble, who would rather surrender and live than die. Ramsay is then legitimized as a true member of House Bolton for taking Moat Cailin.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ralf Kenning is an ironborn captain who takes part in the Fall of Moat Cailin.
            When receiving news about Balon's death, Kenning is one of those who urge Victarion Greyjoy to return to the Iron Isles and claim the Seastone Chair. Before Victarion leaves, he gives the command of the stronghold to Kenning. Some time later, Kenning is shot by one of the Crannogmen with a poisonous arrow. The other ironborn try to treat the wound by pouring boiling wine on it, but to no avail. Kenning has been lying for many days in agony, his condition worsening slowly but surely.
            When Theon is sent to have the ironborn at Moat Cailin surrender, he finds Kenning barely alive. He lies shivering beneath a mountain of furs. The room is filled with foul smell, a miasma of mold and piss and nightsoil, of smoke and sickness. Kenning is naked and feverish, his pale puffy flesh covered with weeping sores and scabs. His head is misshapen, one cheek grotesquely swollen, his neck so engorged with blood that it threatens to swallow his face. The arm on that same side is big as a log and crawling with white worms. No one had bathed him or shaved him for many days, from the look of him. One eye weeps pus, and his beard is crusty with dried vomit. A brief echo of Reek's memories of being Theon resurfaces, of his dignity and honor, causing him to do what the other ironborn would not and personally slit Kenning's throat, to put him out of his misery. The skin splits open in a gout of black blood and yellow pus. Kenning jerks violently, then lies still. An awful stench fills the room, making Theon and the others stumble outside.
            Ralf Kenning in the TV version is not poisoned and immobilized, though he does seem to be suffering from some sort of swamp disease, hinting at how badly the ironborn garrison's conditions are deteriorating.
            The ironborn killed by one of his own men is Dagon Codd. His House is held in contempt by the other ironborn houses, since the Codds descended from thralls and salt wives, their men are said to be thieves and cowards, and their women are wantons who practice incest with their own fathers and brothers. A few days before Theon comes to Moat Cailin, Dagon discovered that out of hunger two of the ironborn had been eating the flesh of their dead comrades, so he executed them. While the other ironborn consider Theon's offer, Dagon objects firmly, reminding the others that he is the one called "The Turncloak" and they should not believe him. He warns Theon to go back to his master or he will kill him. Then Dagon is murdered with an axe by Adrack Humble. Adrack takes command and demands to accept the offer. The other ironborn comply and leave.
            As things turn out, Dagon was right about mistrusting Theon, and was granted a quick painless death. Adrack and other ironborn, who were fooled by the offer, died horrible and agonizing deaths, flayed alive by the Boltons.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ralf_Kenning</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRalfKenning</string></dict>

        <key>Ramsay Bolton</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.156.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Ramsay Bolton, formerly known as Ramsay Snow, was the legitimized bastard son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, and the unidentified wife of a miller.
            During the War of the Five Kings, Ramsay is initially loyal to King in the North Robb Stark, retaking Winterfell from Theon Greyjoy on his orders but at the same time sacking the castle as part of his father's scheme to betray House Stark. Following the successful capture of Winterfell from the Ironborn, Ramsay holds Theon captive and utilizes extreme torture to break him into loyal submission; renaming him "Reek". Following Robb's murder and the decimation of the Stark-loyal northern army at the Red Wedding, he follows his father in pledging allegiance to House Lannister and is legitimized as Ramsay Bolton. Through an arrangement orchestrated by Petyr Baelish, he is wed to Sansa Stark, who escapes from Winterfell along with Theon, which drives him to murder his entire family on threat of being disinherited, becoming the new Warden of the North and Lord of Winterfell. Ramsay's rule over the North, however, comes to an end when Jon Snow retakes Winterfell with army of Free Folk and Stark loyalists. Ramsay is subsequently fed to his own hounds for his crimes against House Stark, leaving House Bolton extinct and restoring House Stark as the ruling family of the North.
            Ramsay Snow is Lord Roose Bolton's bastard son and the product of rape. Years ago, Roose discovered thatÂ a miller had wed without his permission. He had the miller hanged and raped his wife. Ramsay was born shortly afterwards, and his mother brought him to the Dreadfort, his father's castle, for Roose to acknowledge as his son. Roose very nearly killed both Ramsay and his mother, but relented upon realizing that the child was indeed his.
            Ramsay is Roose's only living child following the death of Domeric Bolton, as well as the only possible heir to House Bolton until the birth of a child by Roose's new wife, Fat Walda Frey. He stays behind as castellan of the Dreadfort when his father left for the south to fight in the War of the Five Kings.
            Ramsay keeps a pack of dogs, which he employs for hunting. He is also in a relationship with the kennelmaster's daughter, Myranda, whom he supposedly planned to marry before his father ultimately had him legitimized.
            After WinterfellÂ is seized byÂ Theon Greyjoy for the ironborn, Ramsay is dispatched by his father Roose Bolton to re-take it in the name of King Robb Stark. Ramsay's forces besiege the castle and he infuriates Theon by blowing a horn all through the night. The following morning, Theon rallies his men to defend the castle, but he is betrayed and knocked out cold by his men, who accept Robb Stark's offer of mercy for the ironborn garrison if they surrender and hand over Theon. However, the castle is sacked by Ramsay afterwards and instead of letting the ironborn walk free, he flays them alive.[1]
            Following the Sack of Winterfell, Ramsay and his men take Theon to the Dreadfort, where the ironborn prince is subjected to gruesome tortures. Embarking on a twisted campaign of psychological manipulation, Ramsay poses as an ironborn emissary of Theon's sister, Yara, and falsely claims to have been sent by her to liberate him.[2]
            Ramsay sends a false report to Harrenhal, where the main force of the Northern army has established, of the sacking of Winterfell by the ironborn, of the disappearance of Bran and Rickon Stark, and that the location of Theon Greyjoy is unknown.[2]
            Later that evening Ramsay returns, and releases Theon, provides him with a horse and tells him to ride east to Deepwood Motte, where his sister is waiting for him. Theon's captors, however, track him down and capture him again. As punishment, their leader attempts to rape Theon. Ramsay appears and swiftly dispatches the kidnappers with bow and arrow, deepening the bond of trust between them.[3]
            Afterward, Ramsay promises Theon to take him to Deepwood Motte. Some time later the men reach a holdfast; Theon questions having to sneak inside since Yara's men are loyal to her. Ramsay warns Theon that some of the men belong to his father Balon. As the mysterious boy struggles to open a locked gate, Theon confesses his jealousy of Robb's status, the murder of the two boys he passed off as BranÂ and Rickon, and acknowledges that Eddard Stark was his true father. After opening the gate, Theon and Ramsay enter a darkened room. The young man lights a torch and Theon, much to his horror, realizes he is back in the torture chamber. They are soon joined by two men, who proceed to restrain Theon after Ramsay falsely claims he killed their comrades. Kicking and screaming, Theon is refastened to the rack, as Ramsay drops his facade, grins sadistically and tells the men to put TheonÂ "back where he belongs".[4]
            Ramsay awakens Theon with a horn to continue torturing him. He threatens to remove Theon's pinky finger if he cannot guess Ramsay's true identity and their current location. After several guesses, Ramsay tells Theon he is correct in guessing that Ramsay is Harrion Karstark, the brother of Torrhen Karstark and the son of Lord Rickard Karstark, and that they are in Karhold (Theon being unaware that both Rickard and Harrion are dead). However he then points out that Theon never asked if he was a liar. He admits that he was lying, and begins flaying Theon's finger while his victim screams for him to cut it off.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRamsayBolton</string></dict>
        <key>Raymont Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.157.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Raymont was knighted by Lord Commander Serwyn Errol at the age of 23.[1] When members of the Faith Militant scaled the walls of the Red Keep, Raymont was able to keep them from killing King Aenys and his family.[2] However, Raymont died in the process.[1]
            In Season 1 of the TV series, Ned Stark looks through the pages of The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, but for the visual medium of television the prop had to be filled in with other pages of writing beyond the sections on Robert and Joffrey that Ned specifically read. Writer Bryan Cogman said that he filled in much of this by simply making up names or using in-jokes - and these aren't strictly canon. On the other hand, some of the details are accurate to the novels, such as information on the Blackfyre Rebellion, do match the already released novels.
            One of the entries visible in the book says that one of Orys's sons died preventing an assassination attempt on King Aenys - though his name isn't visible, and more importantly, it is unclear if this was behind-the-scenes information that George R.R. Martin shared with Cogman, or if he simply guessed that one of Aenys's Kingsguard may have died fighting off an assassination attempt in the Faith Militant uprising (the details of which weren't specified until some time after Season 1 was produced).
            In the print material so far, it is unclear if Raymont Baratheon died defending Aenys during the Faith Militant's attack on the Red Keep. Moreover, it is not specifically clear if he was Orys's son or his grandson - only that he was the son of a "Lord Baratheon".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Raymont_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRaymontBaratheon</string></dict>
        <key>Rast</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.158.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rast was a ranger in the Night's Watch, and takes part in the Great Ranging beyond the Wall. Though he is disliked for bullying and his past as a raper, he is generally treated patiently by Jon Snow, Grenn, Pyp and Eddison Tollett, until he betrays the Night's Watch in the Mutiny at Craster's Keep. Instead of helping defend Craster's Keep with the rest of the Mutineers, Rast instead flees the ongoing battle, allowing his former brothers to be massacred by the Night's Watch before being mauled to death by Ghost, the same animal he tormented.
            RastÂ was forced to join the Night's Watch after being arrested for rape. He chose to take the black over the alternate punishment, castration.
            Rast and another new forced recruit join Benjen Stark and Tyrion Lannister's party as it travels to the Wall, escorted by Night's Watch recruiter Yoren. Tyrion talks to Jon Snow about them being rapers, and how Jon had expected the Night's Watch to be made of honorable men, like his uncle Benjen.[1] Jon Snow beats Rast and two other recruits, Grenn and Pypar, in the training yard at Castle Black, leading to Rast,Â Grenn and PyparÂ threatening Jon in the armory. He, along with the other two, is encouraged to leave by Tyrion. Jon later begins training the Night's Watch recruits in the art of combat, earning Pypar and Grenn's respect, but not Rast's.[2]
            Rast is happy to fulfil Ser Alliser Thorne's commands to humiliate Samwell Tarly on his arrival at Castle Black. Jon convinces Pypar and Grenn to go easy on Samwell, but Rast refuses to go along. He says if Ser Alliser puts him up to fight Ser Piggy, he will slice himself off a side of bacon. Jon has his direwolf Ghost threaten him. Rast wakes to find Ghost sitting on his chest with teeth bared, while Jon reminds him that they know where he sleeps. Afterwards, he refuses to beat Samwell, despite Ser Alliser's commands.[3] Rast is assigned to serve in the rangers.[4][5]
            He is later present with Jon, Sam, Grenn and Pyp at the burning of a wight, and shows signs of worry when Sam wonders whether or not the Wall will be enough to stop the White Walkers should they awaken from their slumber. Later on, Jon comes into the dining hall having just been given Longclaw by Jeor Mormont. All of the recruits are excited and asking to see it, chanting the word "sword", but Rast watches from the back table with a look of envy.[6] He takes part in Mormont's Great Ranging Beyond the Wall.[7]
            Rast survives the White Walkers' attack on the Fist of the First Men, and regroups with the remaining survivors as the ranging attempts to pull back to the Wall.[8] As the Night's Watch survivors march back south, Rast taunts an exhausted and demoralized Sam, causing him to collapse. Despite having the chance to go ahead with the survivors, Rast remains behind and attempts to persuade Grenn and Eddison Tollett to leave Sam behind lest they all die. Angry at being held back by them, Lord Commander Mormont commands Sam not to die and Rast to keep him alive, under penalty of death. Rast grudgingly accepts, unprepared to die for Sam.[9]
            After reachingÂ Craster's Keep,Â Rast urges Grenn and EddÂ that they are not safe here, and that Craster is not to be trusted. Following the funeral of their brother Bannen, Rast is visibly angered and blames Bannen's death on Craster starving him. Inside the Keep, tensions are starting to run high among the Night's Watch, as Craster starts berating them. WhenÂ CrasterÂ openly suggests that they should kill their wounded or simply let them be killed by Craster himself, an aggravatedÂ brother of the Night's Watch, Karl, steps forward stating that they're being fed with nothing but bread cut with sawdust, and demands to know where he keeps his hidden larder. Rast joins in on the accusations calling him a "stingy bastard". Enraged, CrasterÂ picks up an axe and threatens to chop the hands off the next man to call him a "bastard". Lord Commander Mormont grabs Rast by the shoulder to lead him out the doorway, when Karl challenges Craster by calling him a "daughter-fucking, wildling bastard". Drunk and enraged, Craster leaps towards Karl with his axe. Karl manages to grab Craster'sÂ axe with his left arm before Craster manages to swing it. Karl then uses his right arm to shove a dagger up Craster's throat, killing him. Lord Commander MormontÂ bellows that the gods will curse them for this as Karl just broke one of the most the ancient and sacred traditions in all of the Seven Kingdoms, the guest right, but Karl ignores this and reminds Mormont they are not in the Seven Kingdoms.
            When Karl proceeds to threaten one of Craster's daughters, Commander MormontÂ draws his sword and threatens to have Karl executed. Karl releases the girl but suddenlyÂ RastÂ stabs the Lord Commander in the back, making him drop his sword. GrennÂ tackles Karl and a mutinyÂ begins. Mortally wounded but alive, the enraged Lord Commander liftsÂ RastÂ off the ground with his bare right hand. He hurls him up towards a wall, nearly succeeding in choking him to death before he starts to choke on his own blood. As the Lord Commander falls to the ground, RastÂ catches his breath before picking up a knife andÂ repeatedly starts stabbing the Lord Commander until he is dead.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rast</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRast</string></dict>
        <key>Razdal mo Eraz</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.159.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Razdal mo ErazÂ was aÂ slave trader from the city of Yunkai, on the coast of Slaver's Bay, and one of the Wise Masters, the ruling elite of the city.
            Razdal mo Eraz is a wealthy Yunkish slaver. He is fluent in the Common Tongue of Westeros.
            Unlike Kraznys mo Nakloz of Astapor, Razdal is not a braggart, but shrewd and politically savvy. A reserved, calculating man, he is capable of being polite when it is politically expedient. While he is still capable of making threats, they are subdued, part of calculated negotiation tactics instead of emotional outbursts.
            Like many of the Wise Masters, he prides himself on Yunkai's descent from the old Ghiscari Empire, which was already old and mighty when the Valyrian Freehold was young.
            Razdal mo Eraz is sent by the Wise Masters to negotiate with Daenerys Targaryen when she sets camp outside of Yunkai and sends word demanding the surrender of the city. He arrives atop a palanquin carried by several slaves. After being announced, he comes too close to Daenerys but is intimidated away by her dragons. Razdal offers Daenerys gifts of gold and ships for her to travel back to Westeros, so that Yunkai will be left in peace. Daenerys offers Razdal his own life if he goes back to the Wise Masters and ensures that all slaves are released and given payment for their years of service or else she will lay waste to Yunkai.
            Dumbfounded at her boldness, Razdal stands defiant and retorts that Yunkai has powerful allies and that after the coming battle the Yunkai'i will enslave the survivors, even Daenerys herself, prompting Drogon to furiously hiss at him. He reminds Daenerys that he was offered safety but she retorts that her dragons react poorly to their "Mother" being threatened. Razdal orders his slaves to take back the gold, but the enraged Drogon stands in their way. Daenerys then sends him away and keeps the gold, as Razdal returns to his palanquin, muttering curses.[1]
            A moment later, Drogon flies up and intimidates the emissaries, with Dany taking flight on his back shortly thereafter. She rides Drogon into the bay as Rhaegal and Viserion emerge from a pyramid to join them and they begin to burn an attacking ship. It is obvious to Razdal that he has made a grave mistake. The Masters' soldiers abandon them, and Missandei announces that one of the three masters must die, as punishment for their disobedience.
            Yezzan, the lowest of the three, is immediately scapegoated by the other two for not being highborn. Grey Worm instead kills Razdal and Belicho with a single slash of his dagger.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the envoy sent by the Wise Masters to parley with Daenerys is called Grazdan mo Eraz. He arrives on a white camel with soldiers. He is described as lean and hard. He also has hair pointed like a unicorn horn (aristocratic Ghiscari in the novels tease out their hair into exotic shapes, but this was omitted from the TV series).
            He does not offer her any ships or a massive amount of gold bars, only a chest of gold coins. He claimed they would enslave the survivors and Daenerys herself prior to offering the gold. He claims that if they fight and defeat Daenerys, they will sell her as a bedslave to one of the Free Cities, as men would pay well to have sex with the last Targaryen. At Daenerys's command, Drogon spits fire at Grazdan, setting his tokar on fire. He yells in protest that Daenerys swore he should have safe conduct. Daenerys taunts him for soiling his pants and whining over a tokar and sends him away, but doesn't keep his gold.
            In the fifth novel, Grazdan travels toÂ VolantisÂ to persuade theÂ TriarchsÂ to join the coalition that Yunkai has formed with other cities against Daenerys, by offering bribes and spreading false horror stories about Daenerys, and succeeds.
            Grazdan is not specifically mentioned among the Yunkish lords who attend the siege of Meereen and the following battle. Unlike in the show, his fate and whereabouts are uncertain.
            The series has renamed him, as was done with the Astapori Good Master Grazdan mo Ullhor, who was renamed as Greizhen mo Ullhor. "Grazdan" is a very common name in Slaver's Bay, due to the fact that the founder of the old Ghiscari Empire over five thousand years ago was Grazdan the Great.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Razdal_mo_Eraz</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRazdalmoEraz</string></dict>
        <key>Ryon Forrester</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.160.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ryon Forrester is the youngest son of Lord Gregor Forrester and his wife, Elissa Forrester.
            The last of the Forrester children, Ryon grew up idolizing his elder siblings and spent many an hour chasingÂ Ethan and Talia through the grove. His youth has been pleasant and shielded from responsibility - but recently Ryon's innocence has begun to fade. When the war began, Ryon was too young to understand why Rodrik and his father were leaving home. But the grim realities of a House at war have been impossible to avoid and Ryon now asks questions for which his siblings have no answers.[2]
            Ryon first appears in the forest just outside Ironrath playing hide and seek with his newly appointed lord brother Ethan Forrester and his sister Talia. Ryon cannot find Ethan and gets scared, having just lost his father and eldest brother, he fears he will lose Ethan too.
            Later, at Ironrath, Ryon is seen carving a wooden sword, which one day he hopes will be a real sword so he can kill the people who destroyed his family. Etched into the sword are the names of two of his brothers, Ethan, for strength, and Rodrik, to remember him. He names the sword Two Brothers. Ethan notices the lack of his other brother's name, Asher.
            Ryon is present when Ramsay Snow is invited into the hall at Ironrath and is shown to be very scared of Ramsay, hiding behind his mother. After Ramsay murders Ethan, he orders that Ryon become a ward of House Whitehill, effectively making the new heir a hostage.
            Ryon remains a ward at Highpoint until his father and brother Ethan's funeral. Rodrik either decides to submit to Lord Whitehill and kiss his ring in order to allow Ryon to attend, or refuses to be cowed by the rival lord. If Rodrik submits, Ryon attends the funeral with an escort of four Whitehill soldiers. Ryon begs his brother to return him to Ironrath, and RodrikÂ promises that his family will not forget him. If RodrikÂ stands up to Lord Whitehill, Ryon is instead kept at Highpoint during the funeral. However,Â Gwyn Whitehill is sent in his place and assures Rodrik that he is fine, but scared, as Ludd Whitehill tells him daily that his family has forgotten him and that his father and brother died because they were traitors and cowards. Rodrik asks Gwyn to ensure he does not believe the lies told to him by Lord Whitehill.
            Ryon does not appear in this episode, but Malcolm Branfield mentions to Asher that everyday they lose is a day Ryon and Talia could be harmed.
            Later, one of the choices is choosing to attempt to save Ryon or exile Gryff as one of the plans for House Forrester to follow.
            If Rodrik beats Gryff, Lady Forrester will mention what Ludd would do to Ryon when he finds out what happened to Gryff as she attempts to stop Rodrik.
            Rodrik, Royland or Duncan, along with his mother and optionally the Glenmore soldiers are invited to Highpoint. After discussing business with Lord Whitehill, Rodrik inquires about Ryon. He also reveals that he has had Gryff and the garrison imprisoned and will glady trade Ryon for Gryff. At this point Lord Whitehill distraught after learning his son has been kidnapped, he orders Ryon to be brought out of his dungeon and begins to threaten them by grabbing a table essential to Ryon's face, stating he will kill Ryon. Rodrik diffuses the situation, and secures the trade, however he isn't freed in this episode as Lord Whitehill refuses to do it anywhere except on neutral ground.
            In the event that Rodrik was saved after the Ambush at the Harbor, Ryon appears prior to the Battle of Ironrath, where he is accompanied by House Whitehill's army and is forced by Lord Whitehill to reveal a "gift" to House Forrester. Much to the horror of Beskha and rest of House Forrester, Ryon wields a spear with Asher's head on the end of it. But as the battle wages on, Rodrik, Beskha, and the pit fighters sneak into the Whitehill camp, where they find Lord Whitehill and Gryff conversing about Ryon, where Gryff intends to sever his legs off so he cannot escape, prompting the player to decide to whether kill Lord Whitehill at the cost of Ryon's life or Gryff to save Ryon. In the event that Gryff is selected, Beskha rescues Ryon and escapes the camp. If Lord Whitehill was the intended target, he taunts Rodrik and claims that Ryon was already dead because he gave orders to Gryff to kill him in the event he was killed. Regardless of whom was killed, Ryon appears in the epilogue (with a cut on his cheek if Rodrik killed Ludd) and is seen escorted by Beskha on horseback.
            If Asher survived the ambush, Ryon is seen outside Ironrath with the Whitehill army while Ludd proposes a truce to the other Forresters. When Ludd sends a cart carrying Rodrik's body into Ironrath, Ryon demands to see his brother. Later when the Forresters invite the Whitehills into Ironrath with the intent of tricking them and killing Ludd, Ryon is taken into the Great Hall with the Whitehill family and briefly reunited with the other Forresters, then moved to the other end of the room. Beskha, on Asher's request, seats herself opposite Ryon and protects him from the Whitehill soldiers when the Forresters plan is executed. It is presumed she escorts him safely out of Ironrath while the battle is taken place. Ryon is last seen in the epilogue on a horse with Beskha.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ryon_Forrester</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRyonForrester</string></dict>
        <key>Podrick Payne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.161.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Podrick Payne, often called Pod, was Tyrion Lannister's squire and saved his life in the Battle of the Blackwater, but following Tyrion's arrest for the murder of King Joffrey Baratheon, he has come into the service of Brienne of Tarth.
            Podrick Payne is a distant cousin of the more famous Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's Justice, and member of a lesser branch of House Payne.
            During the War of the Five Kings, Podrick was the squire of Ser Lorimer, a lesser knight in the Westerlands army. One night Ser Lorimer got drunk and stole a ham, which he shared with Podrick. Lorimer was caught and the two were sentenced to be hanged. Podrick was spared because of his family name.
            As punishment, Tywin Lannister sent him to King's Landing to serve as squire to his son Tyrion.
            Tyrion has Janos Slynt as a dinner guest in the dining room of the Tower of the Hand. Podrick pours wine for them, but spills the beverage on Janos's hand. Janos begins to chastise the boy, but Tyrion dismisses him and says they know how to pour their own wine.[1]
            Podrick attends Tyrion during a dinner he holds with Queen Cersei. He cannot repress a smile when Tyrion jokes about Joffrey's inability to rule.[2]
            Podrick squires for Tyrion during the Battle of the Blackwater. He dresses Tyrion in his armor prior to the battle during a meeting with Lord Varys. Varys asks Tyrion if he trusts Podrick and Tyrion says that he does. Varys then shows them a map of the tunnel network beneath the city. When King Stannis Baratheon lands near the Mud Gate Tyrion dispatches Podrick to fetch reinforcements from the King's Gate. Podrick does as ordered, returning with a host of men just as King Joffrey flees back to the Red Keep.[3]
            Tyrion urges his surviving men and Podrick's reinforcements to help him fight the invaders. He orders Ser Mandon Moore and Ser Boros Blount to join him in leading a sortie through the tunnels. Podrick accompanies Tyrion outside the walls. In the midst of battle, Ser Mandon attempts to murder Tyrion.
            He strikes after Tyrion has removed his helmet but only succeeds in cutting his face. Podrick kills Ser Mandon by shoving a spear through the back of his head, saving Tyrion's life. He cradles Tyrion in his arms as he collapses into unconsciousness.[3]
            When Tyrion wakes up, Podrick is in the room as Varys tells Tyrion about what has been happening while he is unconscious. Tyrion thanks Podrick for saving his life. When Tyrion tells Podrick to go summon Bronn to post Gold Cloaks at his door and to find the hill tribes, Varys stops him and tells Tyrion that Bronn is no longer leading the Gold Cloaks and the hill tribes have gone home. Podrick opens the door to let in Shae, then he leaves the room with Varys.[4]
            Tyrion sends Podrick to urgently get Bronn. Podrick finds Bronn at Littlefinger's brothel with Mirelle and insists he come with him to Bronn's frustration. When they arrive back at the Red Keep, Bronn has Podrick back him up that Bronn has just recently been knighted when two Kingsguards insult him.[5]
            Bronn reminds Tyrion that he still owes Podrick for having saved Tyrion's life. Tyrion then brings Podrick to Littlefinger's brothel and pays for three prostitutes (Marei, Genna, and the contortionist Kayla) to take Podrick's virginity. Podrick later returns with all of Tyrion's coins as the prostitutes enjoyed the experience so much that they did not want any payment. Tyrion and Bronn are amazed and insist that Podrick tell them everything that happened, in "copious detail".[6]
            Ros later mentions to a confused Varys that the girls all said Podrick was the best they'd ever had, and that as three professional prostitutes, they'd been with a lot of men. Varys asks if it's that he's very large, but Ros says that according to the girls he wasn't particularly large, so much as what he did. Varys asks what it was, but Ros says that while the three prostitutes are often very descriptive, the most they could say about the wonderful experience was that it was "hard to describe".[7]
            Sometime later, Pod is present when Lady Olenna Tyrell meets with Tyrion to discuss the costs of the upcoming royal wedding. Olenna admonishes Pod for giving her too much wine and sends him off for figs. Upon returning with the fruit, she sarcastically asks if he retrieved them from Volantis before departing.[8]
            PodrickÂ shares wine with Tyrion, but has trouble keeping up with him. Tyrion, already drunk and unhappy about his forced marriage, tells him if being drunk all the time was easy then everybody would do it. Soon after, Cersei arrives and ordersÂ Podrick to leave so she may speak to her brother alone.[9]
            Bearing the king's banner, Podrick awaits the arrival of Prince Doran Martell of Dorne along with Tyrion and Bronn. As the Dornishmen approach, he correctly identifies the heraldry of several Dornish houses, to the approval of Tyrion. Bronn replies that he needs a sigil. When they learn from the envoys that Doran's brother Oberyn Martell has come to the city instead, and that he arrived before dawn, Podrick accompanies Tyrion and Bronn to Littlefinger's brothel to greet Prince Oberyn and his paramour, Ellaria Sand.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Podrick_Payne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascPodrickPayne</string></dict>

            Prendahl na Ghezn is a warrior and mercenary of Ghiscari origin. Alongside Mero, he is one of the captains of the Second Sons.
            Along with his co-captain Mero, and their lieutenant Daario Naharis, Prendahl meets Daenerys Targaryen in her tent outside Yunkai. He rejects Daenerys's offer of breaking the Second Sons' contract with the Wise Masters and watches as Mero rudely snubs Daenerys' offers.
            Prendahl then discusses how to deal with Daenerys with Mero and Daario. To avoid facing her Unsullied Mero proposes that one of them slips into Daenerys's camp and assassinate her. He gives three different coins - a Meereenese, a Braavosi, and a Volantene - to the bedslave attending them and has her hand them out at random to the three of them, the one with the Braavosi coin being charged with the assassination. Daario winds up with the Braavosi coin. Later that night, after sneaking into Daenerys's pavilion, Daario presents Prendahl's head, along with that of Mero. He explains that he, Mero and Daario had "philosophical differences" about Daenerys's beauty and forced Daario to kill her, and he refused, and they fought him but lost. He then pledges the Second Sons to Daenerys.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Prendahl is a sellsword of Ghiscari descent and serves as the commander of the Stormcrows, a noted mercenary company which fights for the highest bidder. Daario NaharisÂ and Sallor the Bald are the other two captains of the company.
            Prendahl and Sallor are killed by Daario. Later he sneaks into Daenerys's camp and produces the severed heads of his comrades as proof of his loyalty to her.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Prendahl_na_Ghezn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascPrendahlnaGhezn</string></dict>
        <key>Pycelle</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.164.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Pycelle was the Grand Maester for multiple kings and a member of the small council, but his true loyalties lay with House Lannister. He died moments before the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor as a result of a plot orchestrated by Qyburn, a former maester himself, who had his little birds stab Pycelle to death.
            Pycelle has been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms for decades and has served under four kings when the series begins. The Grand Maester is the King's personal maester, a learned man wise in history, science and medicine who also provides counsel. The Grand Maester sits on the King's small council, which runs the realm in the name of the King. He served King Aerys II Targaryen prior to Robert's Rebellion. He remembers Aerys as a great man before his descent into madness. When Tywin Lannister marched to the gates of King's Landing following the rebel victory at the Battle of the Trident and all of the King's advisors told Aerys not to trust the Lord of Casterly Rock, Pycelle gave the opposite counsel and the city gates were opened, allowing the Lannister forces to sack the capital.
            Following the rebellion he remained Grand Maester to King Robert Baratheon. He is joined on the small council by the Master of Coin Petyr Baelish, also called Littlefinger, the Master of Whisperers Varys, the Master of Ships Stannis Baratheon and the Master of Laws Renly Baratheon. He plays up his age to appear harmless but is actually mentally sharp and dangerous.[1] He is loyal to Queen Cersei Lannister and was involved in the birth of all of her children, assisted by midwives.[2] Pycelle also privately flouts the vow of celibacy taken by maesters, as he enjoys the company of prostitutes such as Ros.
            Pycelle calls a small council meeting to greet Lord Eddard Stark upon his arrival from Winterfell to take up the role of King's Hand. Eddard greets him cordially, but cannot help mentioning that Pycelle served under the Mad King.[3] Eddard meets with Pycelle to discuss the death of his predecessor Lord Jon Arryn and suggests that he might have been killed by poison. Pycelle says he thinks it unlikely having treated Jon for a feverish illness. He still cautions Eddard to remember that poison is the weapon of a woman or a eunuch; making sure that Eddard understands that he is implicating Varys. Pycelle also lends Eddard a book about the lineages of the Great Houses that Jon borrowed just before his death.[4]
            Pycelle supports the motion to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen before she can provide Khal Drogo with an heir. Pycelle elucidates that he bears her no ill will personally, but fears that a Dothraki invasion of Westeros would be devastating. He argues that though unpleasant, it is preferable to have her killed now rather than have thousands die later. His argument does not convince Eddard.[5]
            Pycelle is in court when Eddard dispatches Lord Beric Dondarrion to bring Ser Gregor Clegane to justice for his looting in the Riverlands. Stark also sends word to Casterly Rock, demanding that Lord Tywin Lannister explain his bannerman's actions. Littlefinger and Pycelle object, but Eddard insists on seeking justice.[6]
            Pycelle tends to King Robert Baratheon after he is gored by a boar while hunting. He predicts the King's imminent death and manages his pain using milk of the poppy. Following Robert's death Eddard claims that Joffrey is not his son and is arrested for treason.[7] Cersei and Pycelle convince Sansa Stark to write to her brother Robb, imploring him to swear fealty to Joffrey.[8]
            Pycelle is present for the trial of Eddard on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor. He counsels mercy after Eddard's confession but Joffrey has Eddard executed.[9] After sleeping with Ros, Pycelle absentmindedly mutters about how King Aerys had begun his reign as a great man before slipping into insanity. He muses about Joffrey's potential for greatness, but his remarks peter out into mumbled nothings. Ros leaves and Pycelle does a series of exercises and stretches, then dresses and walks confidently to his door, before adopting the meek, fragile appearance he usually wears to court. He is much stronger in body and mind than he appears, but hides this from everyone.[10]
            Grand Maester Pycelle reports to the small council that the Conclave in Oldtown has announced the end of the longest summer in living memory and shows the white raven sent for this purpose. Varys adds that the smallfolk say that a long summer will be followed by an even longer winter, which Pycelle dismisses as a peasant superstition.[11]
            Tyrion appears at a small council meeting to inform them that he has been made acting Hand of the King by his father. Queen Cersei angrily orders councilors to leave, Pycelle, along with Lord Baelish, Varys, and Lord Slynt, abandon the room.[11]
            Cersei reads Robb Stark's peace terms aloud to the small council before tearing them up. Tyrion remarks that she has perfected the art of tearing up papers and suggests that they at least return Eddard's remains as a gesture of good faith. Cersei asks Alton Lannister to deliver their reply and he accepts. Cersei also asks him to tell Jaime that he has not been forgotten, to the consternation of the other council members. Tyrion wishes Alton a safe journey.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Pycelle</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascPycelle</string></dict>
        <key>Petyr Baelish</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.165.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Petyr Baelish, popularly called Littlefinger, was the Master of Coin on the Small Council under King Robert Baratheon and King Joffrey Baratheon. He was a skilled manipulator and used his ownership of brothels in King's Landing to both accrue intelligence on political rivals and acquire vast wealth. Baelish's spy network is eclipsed only by that of his arch-rival Varys.
            After marrying Lady Lysa Tully, widow of Lord Jon Arryn of the Vale, and her subsequent death at his hand, he became the Lord Protector of the Vale. Because of his relationship with her, Baelish was able to heavily influence Lysa's son Robin Arryn, the new Lord Paramount of the Vale. To further his goal of sitting on the Iron Throne, Baelish took Sansa Stark under his wing in order to gain some influence within House Stark, but his role in the deaths of Eddard Stark, Jon Arryn and Lysa Arryn, which effectively began the War of the Five Kings based on a lie to weaken the Seven Kingdoms, was finally exposed and he was executed for his crimes.
            Petyr Baelish is the head of House Baelish and the lord of an extremely minor holding, so small it has neither name nor a maester, located in a small area within the Fingers, a coastal region in the northeastern shores of the Vale of Arryn. He is currently the only living member of House Baelish.
            House Baelish had very meager origins and no distinguished lineage: Petyr's great-grandfather was a lowly sellsword from Braavos who came to the Vale at the invitation of House Corbray. Petyr's grandfather was a poor hedge knight, who managed to earn a minor lordship of a few stony acres in the smallest peninsula of the Fingers.[1]
            Petyr's father fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, the preemptive assault on the forces of Maelys Blackfyre, the last of the Blackfyre Pretenders, before they could attempt an invasion of Westeros. During the conflict, Petyr's father served well under Lord Hoster Tully. Through their good relationship Hoster agreed to foster his son Petyr at Riverrun, a great honor for a lesser House.[1]
            Petyr went to Riverrun when he was eight years old, carrying all he owned in a bundle.[2] At Riverrun he befriended Hoster's daughters Catelyn and Lysa Tully. Their brother Edmure mockingly nicknamed him "Littlefinger", in reference to his small height at the time and the location of his minor landholdings. The nickname would stick with him throughout his life. Eventually, even Petyr sarcastically embraced the nickname, because it showed how far he had risen, from an impoverished noble-born boy from an insignificant minor House in the "little Finger" peninsula of the Vale, to one of the most powerful officials at the royal court.
            Petyr became smitten with Catelyn, but she never returned his affections. Lysa was infatuated with Petyr, but he only loved Catelyn. Eventually when she was betrothed to Brandon Stark, heir to Lord of Winterfell and Lord Paramount of the North, Petyr challenged him to a duel, thinking he could win through pluck and courage but he was promptly overpowered and nearly killed, though Catelyn begged Brandon to spare his life. Embittered, Petyr was cast out of Riverrun and returned to the Vale. During the course of Robert's Rebellion, however, Brandon was killed by the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen, so Catelyn married his younger brother Eddard Stark, while to secure a political alliance Lysa was wed to Jon Arryn, ruler of the Vale. Manipulating Lysa's infatuation with himself, Petyr ingratiated himself into Jon's services, first as customs officer at Gulltown, where he increased the port's revenues tenfold. Seeing Littlefinger's financial acumen, Jon was easily convinced by Lysa to later bring Littlefinger to the royal court at King's Landing, and make him Master of Coin on King Robert Baratheon's Small Council.[1] Petyr's naked ambition often placed him at odds with the Master of Whisperers, Varys.
            In charge of the crown's treasury, Littlefinger rapidly grew into a powerful player in royal politics and a master of court intrigues. Of an older mindset, few who did not know him suspected Littlefinger as a threat, seeing only that he was a man from a very minor House, with no distinguished lineage, significant landholdings, or armies. Instead, Littlefinger based his newfound power on money.[1] Baelish is unscrupulous in his search for power and wealth: he has bought multiple brothels in the city. Particularly a high class brothel catering to the nobles in the city, cynically noting that whores make a better investment than ships, because they rarely sink. Baelish makes good use of his brothels to have his agents spy on and manipulate his clientele, and owns one of the largest spy networks in Westeros, second only to Varys's. Littlefinger has been known to privately bribe lords who have unusual or violent sexual fetishes, if they pay the right price; ranging from supplying lords with amputee prostitutes, to delivering young boys to pederasts,[3] and even delivering prostitutes to be secretly murdered by his clients for thrill-kills.[4][5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Petyr_Baelish</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascPetyrBaelish</string></dict>
        <key>Pyat Pree</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.166.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Pyat Pree was a warlock from Qarth and also a member of the Thirteen.
            Pyat Pree is one of the warlocks of Qarth, a wise man who claims mystical powers. Together with the rest of his order, he dwells in the mysterious House of the Undying, located within the city of Qarth. Even though the power of and respect for the warlocks has considerably waned over years and many dismiss them as little more than charlatans performing parlor tricks, tradition and custom has allowed Pyat Pree a place among the Thirteen.
            Pyat Pree is present when the Thirteen greet Daenerys Targaryen at the gates of Qarth, and she and her people are allowed into the city.[1]
            Pyat Pree attends a reception for Daenerys in the gardens of the home of Xaro Xhoan Daxos. He personally welcomes Daenerys Targaryen on behalf of the Warlocks of Qarth. He gives her a gem and tells her to look into it until she can see herself in its facets. When she looks up Daenerys sees that there are now two of him talking to her. He invites her to come the House of the Undying. Xaro apologizes for the warlock, he says that though they are not thought highly of, it is customary to extend the warlocks an invitation. Ser JorahÂ MormontÂ gets a warning from the mysterious womanÂ Quaithe to beware that all men will wish to see the dragons, and in seeing them, will lust after them.[2]
            Daenerys's dragons are stolen from Xaro's home.[3] Xaro uses the theft as a pretense to hold a council of the Thirteen in his home. He then stages a coup with the assistance of Pyat Pree and declares himself King of Qarth. The warlock uses his magic to kill the rest of the Thirteen. They reveal that they stole the dragons and have taken them to the House of the Undying. Daenerys flees in terror. Pyat Pree stops her in the entrance hall using another of his duplicates. He tells her to come to the House of the Undying to be reunited with her children. Ser JorahÂ arrives and stabs him in the back; the body disappears, and only the clothes remain. Another double reappears next to the window, again asking Daenerys why she resists.[4]
            When Daenerys travels to the House of the Undying to retrieve her dragons, Pyat Pree creates illusions around her as she travels throughout the House's chambers. When she reaches the room with her dragons, Pyat confronts her, saying that his magic was reborn when the dragons were born, that it is strongest in their presence, and that the dragons are strongest in hers. Using magic, he chains Daenerys, telling her she will stay with him for an eternity to fuel his magic; however, as he does this, he inadvertently provokes the dragons. Upon her saying dracarys, the dragons open fire on him, roasting him alive in seconds.[5]
            The warlocks of Qarth try and get revenge on Daenerys by sending an unidentified warlock to Astapor to assassinate her. The knight Ser Barristan Selmy saves Daenerys. However, the warlock escapes using magic.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Pyat Pree is a pale man with blue lips, like most of his order. He, along withÂ Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Quaithe,Â approach Daenerys Targaryen in the ruined city of Vaes TolorroÂ (not included in the TV series) and invite her to QarthÂ (instead of greeting DaenerysÂ atÂ QarthÂ in theÂ TV show). Later on he invites her to the House of the Undying, and instructs her how to move inside without getting lost.
            In the books PreeÂ shows no ability to conjure doubles; he doesn'tÂ stealÂ Daenerys'Â dragons, norÂ try to imprison her, neither is he killed. He is not a member of the Thirteen.
            After Daenerys steps out of the House of the Undying, Pyat Pree is angry at her for burning the palace and injuring his masters, the Undying. He draws a knife and charges at her, but is stopped by Drogon, Jhogo, and Rakharo.
            Daenerys soon learns that Pyat Pree is gathering the surviving warlocks together to work ill on her. Thus she has no choice but to leave Qarth urgently. Currently Pyat Pree is still after her.
            In "The Forsaken" sample chapter of the sixth novel, Aeron Greyjoy is held prisoner at Euron's ship. Several more prisoners are brought to his cell, two of them are warlocks of the east. Their flesh is as white as mushrooms and lips are purplishÂ­-blue. One of those has lost his legs. The mutes hang him from a rafter, and he cries âPreeâ repeatedly as he swings; Aeron has no idea what the tortured man means by that word, and thinks it is perhaps the name of the demon that he worships. It is unclear if that warlock is Pyat Pree.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Pyat_Pree</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascPyatPree</string></dict>
        <key>Pylos</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.167.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Samwell Tarly mentions that he may be able to cure Jorah Mormont's greyscale using Pylos' methods, but is rebuked by Ebrose who says that Pylos died of the same disease and, because of this, Pylos' methods are forbidden to be used again.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire, Pylos is a common maester, not an Archmaester, and is in service to Stannis Baratheon at Dragonstone. He is still very much alive, and at 25 years old, is unlikely to be considered an "expert" in any particular field. He has been training to succeed Maester Cressen. He is kind, friendly and trustworthy.
            Pylos treats Davos while the latter is imprisoned at Dragonstone. He also treats Edric Storm, one of Robert's bastards (in the show he was replaced with Gendry), with leeches; the blood-filled leeches are later used in Melisandre's ritual against the three false kings.
            Pylos educates Princess Shireen, her cousin Edric Storm, and Davos's fifth son Devan. He does give any of them a slack: he chides Edric for boasting about his father's victories, by pointing out that Robert also suffered defeats, among them at Ashford.
            After Davos is raised to the position of Stannis's Hand of the King, he consults with Pylos, fearing that he is not worthy for that office because he is not highborn, veteran knight or educated. Pylos encourages Davos by pointing out that highborn nobles, great knights and educated men were extremely poor Hands, while a simple blacksmith's son was an excellent Hand. He (in the show - Shireen) teaches Davos to read and write.
            During one lesson, Pylos shows Davos a letter, which happens to be the distress message from Castle Black. Davos, unlike the former Hand, understands the importance of the message and persuades Stannis to travel north and assist the Night's Watch.
            Pylos is one of the people whom Davos gathers, to help him save Edric Storm from being sacrificed. Davos admires Pylos's courage, because he knew well what would be his punishment for assisting Davos.
            Later, Stannis travels to the North, leaving at Dragonstone a small garrison. Pylos also remains in Dragonstone.
            In the fourth novel, Loras Tyrell conquers Dragonstone. It is not mentioned what has become of Pylos and the rest of the occupants of the castle - whether they have been killed or captured alive.
            There is no mentioning in the novels that Pylos has ever researched the greyscale, or any other disease.

        <key>Pypar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.168.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Pypar, commonly called Pyp, was a steward in the Night's Watch and a friend to Jon Snow, Grenn, Eddison Tollett and Samwell Tarly.
            Pypar was sent to the Wall for refusing to grant sexual favors to a lord at Acorn Hall while working as a singer. The lord accused him of stealing and he was sentenced to the Night's Watch and now serves at Castle Black. Pypar usually lies and tells people that he was arrested for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his sister, who had not eaten for three days (it isn't clear if he really even has a sister).[1]
            Pypar, along with Grenn and Rast, is beaten bloody by Jon Snow in the training yard at Castle Black. They later threaten Jon in the armory, but are dissuaded by Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion contrasts Pypar's background as a starving peasant to Jon's privileged upbringing in a warm castle with a master-at-arms eager to teach him in the art of combat. This encourages Jon to start training the others in swordplay, earning their respect.[2]
            Pypar, Jon and Samwell are assigned to the stewards while Grenn is assigned to the rangers. Jon is upset that he has not gotten his desired appointment to the rangers. Pypar is annoyed by Jon's sense of entitlement and awkwardly tells Jon and Samwell that he was really sent to the Wall when as a singer at a nobleman's hall he refused to grant sexual favors to a noble lord. He didn't want to tell strangers the real reason. Samwell asks Pypar, who has a good singing voice, for a song, but Pypar is too embarrassed by his confession and walks off.[4]
            The dead men return as wights and Jon saves the Lord Commander from one of them. He is rewarded with the sword Longclaw and Grenn, Pypar and the others pass the sword around in the dining hall.[6]
            Grenn, Pypar and Sam ride after Jon when he abandons his post at Castle Black following the death of his father. They convince him to return by reciting their oaths.[7]
            Pyp remains at Castle Black while his friends are Beyond the Wall on Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's great ranging.
            Pyp is present when Jon Snow returns to Castle Black after escaping from the wildlings and being shot with arrows by Ygritte. At first, he doesn't think Jon can recognize him and Sam with his injuries. Jon stares at both of them and says their names with relief before being carried inside.[8]
            Pyp and other members of the Night's Watch receive news from a boy name Olly about how his entire village was massacred by a wildling raiding party. The meeting is interrupted by a single horn blast, which is revealed to be Grenn and Edd, who have managed to escape the chaos that occurred at Craster's Keep.[9]
            Later, Pyp is present in the dining hall when Jon Snow asks for volunteers to deal with the mutineers who are holed up at Craster's Keep.[10]
            The news of the wildling attack on Mole's Town reaches Castle Black. Sam is horrified by the news, believing he sent Gilly and her baby to their deaths. Pyp reminds Sam that he believed that everyone who went with Commander Mormont had died. Despite the odds, Jon, Sam, Grenn, and Edd all made it back to Castle Black alive.[11]
            As he is preparing for the attack on Castle Black, he starts shaking, and Sam comes over to comfort and empower him to conduct his duties. As Mance Rayder's army attacks Castle Black, Pypar defends the bridge with a crossbow but continually missed killing members of their army before retreating with Sam. Pypar and Sam get to cover, and continue to try to kill the members of Mance Rayder's army. When Pypar successfully kills a wildling, he gushes over this achievement with Sam telling him he has more to do. As he goes to shoot again, Ygritte shoots an arrow at Pyp, mortally wounding him. As Pyp struggles and chokes on his own blood, Sam cradles him before he dies.[12]
            After the arrival ofÂ Stannis Baratheon and his forces, Pypar is among the numerous bodies of fallen black brothers burned in Castle Black's courtyard.[13]
            Prior to being cast in the role of Gendry, Joe Dempsie had auditioned for Pypar.[14]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Pyp is an actor who wandered the Seven Kingdoms with a troupe of players. He can imitate other people's voices and boasts that he can identify where in Westeros someone has come from just by their accent. He is named to the rangers. George R.R. Martin has stated that he is a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, in which main character Frodo Baggins's best friend is Samwise Gamgee, called Sam for short. Similarly, Jon Snow's best friend Samwell Tarly (also called "Sam" for short) is also an overweight, not martially skilled Everyman character who enjoys reading stories in books. Moreover, Pypar (called Pyp) for short, has a similar name to Frodo's other companion Pippin Took (sometimes shortened to "Pip"). Thus both Jon Snow and Frodo Baggins have two companions named "Sam and Pyp".
            While the ranging force travels beyond the Wall, Pyp remains at Castle Black. He takes part in the Battle of Castle Black.
            Despite Pyp and Grenn dying in the TV series, so far the two are still alive and well in the books.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Pypar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascPypar</string></dict>

            Paxter Redwyne is the Lord of the Arbor and the head of House Redwyne, a vassal family of House Tyrell of Highgarden.
            Lord Petyr Baelish tries to entice Lord Varys to one of this brothels mentioning how he will accommodate any preference or inclination. Lord Varys already knows and lists the illicit practices his spies have uncovered including Lord Redwyne's sexual proclivity towards prepubescent boys.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, no mention is made of his sexual preferences â if this was indeed the "Lord Redwyne" that Lord Varys was referring to, and not some distant cousin.
            Lord Paxter Redwyne commands one of the largest fleets in the Seven Kingdoms which anchors at the Arbor. During Robert's Rebellion, he participated in the Siege of Storm's End; his fleet prevented the castle from being resupplied by sea. It is mentioned in passing that Stannis Baratheon still bears a grudge against Lord Redwyne for this.
            He is the first cousin and oldest friend of his liege lord, Mace Tyrell. He married Lord Mace's elder sister, Lady Mina of House Tyrell, and they have two sons, Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, andÂ one daughter, Desmera.
            Lord Redwyne is described as "stoop-shouldered and thin, his bald head fringed by tufts of orange hair."
            Lord Redwyne doesn't side with Renly Baratheon in the War of the Five Kings, as Cersei held his twin sons hostage at the Red Keep. Following the Battle of the Blackwater, he is made an advisor on the Small Council alongside his liege Lord Mace Tyrell and Lord Mathis Rowan. At the breakfast prior to King Joffrey's wedding ceremony, he unveils a scale model of a war galley with 200 oars being built in the shipyards of the Arbor, which will be named King Joffrey's Valor, though it's currently unknown if the name was changed following Joffrey's death.
            In the fifth novel, following Cersei's arrest, Lord Redwyne is given a seat at the Small CouncilÂ as theÂ Master of ShipsÂ and Grand Admiral.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Paxter_Redwyne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascPaxterRedwyne</string></dict>

            Ormund was Hand of the King to Aegon V Targaryen and commanded the royal forces against Maelys Blackfyre during the War of the Ninepenny Kings. He died in the fighting at the Stepstones, and according to singers, he spent his dying moments in the arms of his son, Steffon.[1]
            According to The World of Ice and Fire, Ormund was the heir of Lyonel Baratheon, who rebelled against King Aegon V, until Ormund himself was betrothed to the King's daughter, Rhaelle Targaryen. He later became Hand of the King to Jaehaerys II, his brother-in-law. This is different from the continuity of the show, in which Jaehaerys has been removed.
            While fighting at the Stepstones at the head of the royal forces, Ormund was killed by Maelys and died in the arms of Steffon. Command of the royal forces passed to Ser Gerold Hightower, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ormund_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOrmundBaratheon</string></dict>

House Whent is also the birth house of Minisa Tully, wife of Hoster Tully and mother of his three children, Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure.
            Ser Oswell is mentioned in the entry of his sworn brother, Lord Commander Gerold Hightower as recorded in The Book of Brothers. The entry mentions the death of Ser OswellÂ after refusing to bend the knee to the new king, Robert Baratheon.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Oswell Whent was a younger brother of Lord Whent, known and remembered for his dark humor. He wore a distinctive helmet emblazoned with a black bat with its wings spread, symbolizing House Whent. Oswell was present at the Tourney at Harrenhal where Jaime Lannister became a Kingsguard. In the books, Ser Oswell was present with Ser Gerold Hightower and Ser Arthur Dayne in the Showdown at the Tower of Joy with Lord Eddard Stark. After Ser Gerold tells Ned they were not at the Battle of the Trident, Ser Oswell declares, "Woe to the Usurper if we had been." He and his two brothers are slain along with the bulk of Ned's force in the ensuing melee, the only survivors being Howland Reed and Ned himself.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Oswell_Whent</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOswellWhent</string></dict>
        <key>Olyvar Frey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.173.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Olyvar Frey was one of the many sons of Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing, and was a squire to King Robb Stark.
            When Catelyn Stark negotiates with Lord Frey to gain permission for her son Robb Stark and his army to pass the The Twins, one of Walder's demandsÂ is for his son Olyvar be made Robb's squire, and for him eventually to be knighted. Robb accepts these terms.[1]
            He is presumably poisoned by Arya Stark, in retaliation for the Red Wedding.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Olyvar is the eighteenth son of Lord Walder overall and the fourth born to Lord Walder's sixth wife, Bethany Rosby. His three older brothers are Perwyn, Benfrey, Willamen, and his younger sister is Roslin. He is two years older than Robb Stark although he is very immature compared to Robb. He takes part in the Battle of the Whispering Wood.
            When Robb breaks his marriage pact with House Frey, Olyvar wants to remain with him but is forced by his siblings to leave Robb.
            Olyvar, alongside his brother Perwyn and nephew Alesander, are kept in the dark about Lord Walder's plan to betray and kill Robb Stark at the Red Wedding. Apparently it was suspected that the three of them were too loyal to Robb, and would try to warn him or even to defend him when the ambush commenced, so they are sent away from the Twins "on duty". Catelyn and Robb ask about them, but receive only evasive answers. Too late, as the massacre begins, Catelyn realizes the significance of their absence.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Olyvar_Frey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOlyvarFrey</string></dict>
        <key>Olyvar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.174.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Olyvar is a spy and a prostitute in the employ of Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish, catering exclusively to male clientele.
            Olyvar poses as Loras Tyrell's squire during a sparring match. He makes flirtatious advances toward Loras and the two later have sex. Olyvar discovers that Loras is due to be married to Sansa Stark, and relays this information to Littlefinger shortly thereafter. Olyvar implies that noblemen in Loras' position make up the bulk of his clientele.[2]
            Olyvar has been left in charge ofÂ Littlefinger's brothels, presumably replacing Ros. When Oberyn Martell and Ellaria Sand arrive in King's Landing, they visit the brothel and Olyvar presents three prostitutes to the couple. After Ellaria chooses one and dismisses the other two, Oberyn turns his attentions to Olyvar. The latter protests that he's not on offer, before giving in and admitting he's just "wildly expensive". Oberyn asks if Olyvar has ever been with a prince before, orders him to remove his clothes and grabs him by the crotch. However, they are interrupted when Oberyn overhears a pair of Lannister men singing "The Rains of Castamere".[3]
            Olyvar later takes part in a small orgy involving Oberyn, Ellaria and two other prostitutes. Ellaria kisses Olyvar, who politely refuses her, claiming to have "not acquired the taste" for women. He then presses Oberyn to divulge his own preference. The Prince, however, explains his rather fluid approach to sexuality, a common trait among the Dornish. Olyvar and the other prostitutes depart when Tywin Lannister unexpectedly arrives to speak with Oberyn.[4]
            Olyvar continues to see Loras on a regular basis, though it's unclear if their arrangement is personal or professional. Around the time of Tywin Lannister's funeral, Olyvar is cuddling with Loras Tyrell post coitus, discussing the possibility of visiting Dorne or anywhere far away from King's Landing, when Margaery walks in. Staring down Olyvar, she admonishes Loras for making them late for supper with King Tommen, and tells Olyvar to leave.[5]
            Olyvar later plays the role of the Father with a fake beard when the High Septon visits the brothel, while a collection of female prostitutes play the rest of the Seven. He breaks character to make a snide remark about the High Septon's choice, and to remind him that two prostitutes will cost him extra. Moments later, the brothel is attacked by Sparrows, led by Lancel Lannister, who seize the High Septon. Olyvar attempts to tell them that they will have to answer to Baelish, but they strike him across the face and remove his fake beard.[6]
            Olyvar is present when the brothel is attacked again by the Sparrows, this time having formed into the Faith Militant with Cersei Lannister's permission. Again, he is struck when he tells them they will have to answer to Baelish. Olyvar hears screams coming from another room which he approaches to see the Sparrows have singled out a man having sex with one of the male prostitutes, and approach him with a knife. Olyvar flees as one of the men screams off-screen. (it is heavily implied they are either castrated or killed)[7]
            Olyvar is later called to give evidence at the "Holy Inquest" of Loras, who is accused of "fornication", "buggery", and "blasphemy", though it is clear he is doing it on Cersei's instructions. Despite their previous, affectionate relationship, Olyvar turns on his lover, and provides the High Sparrow with testimony that allows him to pursue formal charges against Loras, who attempts to attack Olyvar but is restrained. Olyvar's testimony also leads to Margaery's arrest for perjury, despite Loras and Margaery both denouncing Olyvar as a liar.[8]
            Later, during a meeting between Lady Olenna and Petyr Baelish, Baelish reveals that Cersei summoned him back to King's Landing for "a piece of information" he had, revealing that Cersei forced Baelish to give up Olyvar so she could build up a case against Loras and Margaery. He tells Olenna that he will give her the same thing he gave Cersei: a handsome young man âimplied, in this instance, to be Lancel.[9]
            In the books, Loras Tyrell is left deeply mourning the loss of his great love Renly Baratheon, and famously swears that he will never love again, saying "When the sun has set, no candle can replace it." Several critics including Westeros.org were upset that Loras has sex with Olyvar in "Kissed by Fire", because it seemed rather sudden, as if Renly's death did not deeply impact him. Writer Bryan Cogman, however, subsequently did an interview with Westeros.org, and specifically addressed this concern: changes in adaptation meant that Loras had to have sex with Olyvar, to let it slip that he would marry Sansa, as part of the plot mechanics of the Lannister/Tyrell rivalry. However, Cogman explained, his earlier drafts of the episode actually included longer scenes which made it explicitly clear that Loras is not finished mourning Renly. Rather, Loras was very depressed and lonely, and in effect "drowning his sorrows" by engaging in casual sex in the hope that it would make himself feel better, but it ultimately made Loras feel more emotionally distraught and reminded of how much he misses Renly. Cogman lamented that "as we get closer to production a lot of trims have to be made and this scene was one where I had to do that," and he acknowledged that cutting the scene gave the unintended impression that Loras was moving past Renly, when he actually isn't.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Olyvar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOlyvar</string></dict>
        <key>Olly</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.175.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>OllyÂ was a farm boy from the Gift who fled to the Night's Watch after his village was attacked by the Free Folk. He goes on to be named the personal steward of Jon Snow.
            Olly lived with his mother and father in a village in the Gift.
            When Olly and his father are on their way home for dinner, their village is attacked by a group of wildlings. When his father is killed by Ygritte, his mother tells him to hide. He flees, and she is killed by Styr. Olly hides under a cart, but is caught by the Thenn warg. The warg brings him to Styr, who holds a blade to his throat. Styr tells OllyÂ that he is going to eat his dead parents, and orders him to tell the men of the Night's Watch at Castle Black in an attempt to draw them out into the open. He then releasesÂ Olly, who reaches Castle Black and informs the men of the approaching wildlings.[1]
            OllyÂ stays at Castle Black, living amongst the brothers of the Night's Watch and wearing the black clothes of the Night's Watch. He later trains with them for the upcoming fight against the wildlings. Olly brags to the brothers about his archery skills, though only Grenn says he believes him, as well as promising to take him hunting soon. [2]
            Olly greets Jon Snow, Grenn and Eddison Tollett as they return to Castle Black after coming from Craster's Keep. Jon pats him on the head as he greets the brothers.[3]
            Olly remains at Castle Black and spars with Jon Snow in the training yard, alongside other new recruits. He has little experience with a sword and shield, but Jon does his best to teach Olly how to be a proper swordsman. Olly abruptly stops sparring when Melisandre arrives to fetch Jon. Later, Olly is present when Mance Rayder is executed by Stannis Baratheon for refusing to bend the knee.[6]
            Olly is present at the choosing for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and is happy when Jon Snow defeats Ser Alliser Thorne for the position of Lord Commander.[7]
            Jon later names Olly as his personal steward, grooming him for command as Jeor Mormont once did for him. He is present at Jon's meeting with Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth, in which Jon points out, while looking at Olly, that many of his black brothers do not like the wildlings. Later, Davos asks Olly to recite part of the Night's Watch oath in order to persuade Jon to rally the Night's Watch to Stannis's side in the upcoming battle for the North. Olly is later at a meeting of Night's Watch where Janos Slynt refuses to man and repair Greyguard, a ruined castle on the Wall. Jon orders Slynt to be brought outside and orders Olly to bring him Longclaw. Olly gives Jon his sword and witnesses Slynt's execution.[8]
            However, Olly's trust in Jon begins to sour after Jon makes the suggestion of allowing the wildlings to pass through the Wall and become subjects of the Seven Kingdoms or even members of the Night's Watch so as to avoid them falling into the coming White Walker army. First Steward Bowen Marsh points out what the wildlings did to Olly's family and friends in the Gift while in Mance Rayder's army. Later, in Jon's office, Olly asks if Jon means to lure the wildlings into a trap, but Jon denies it, reminding Olly that despite the losses they have suffered at the wildlings' hands, they will need all the help they can get if the Night's Watch is to stand a chance against the White Walkers.[9]
            Later, Olly visits Sam in his rooms, ostensibly to offer him some food. However, he wants to ask Sam why Jon would want to join forces with the Wildlings, particularly Tormund, who led the raid in which his parents were killed. Sam reassures Olly that Jon knows what he is doing, and that unless he is successful, neither the Night's Watch nor Westeros stands a chance against the White Walkers. Sam explains this is a hard choice Jon had to make, however unpopular, and then then tells him not to worry, as Jon always comes back.[10]
            When Jon Snow returns from Hardhome with thousands of wildlings and lets them in through the Wall, Olly is among the many black brothers who look at the wildlings and even their Lord Commander with disgust. When Jon smiles at Olly, the boy goes away angrily.[11]
            Olly is sent to Jon's room to let him know that a Wildling knows where his uncle Benjen is. Jon quickly rushes out of the room, across the courtyard and past a group of Night's Watchmen, only to find a sign with the word "Traitor" scrawled upon it. Several Night's Watchmen mutiny against Jon and stab him, bringing him to his knees, and Olly approaches. Jon whispers Olly's name as a plea for mercy. With tears in his eyes, Olly finishes Jon off by stabbing him through the heart, ending the mutiny and leaving his Lord Commander dead in the snow. [12]
            Olly is present in the dining room of Castle Black when Thorne announces Jon's murder at their hands and gives his justification to sway most of the Watch to his side. He witnesses Thorne issue Davos Seaworth and the brothers loyal to Jon his ultimatum to surrender or die.[13]
            Later, Olly is present as the mutineers attempt to break into the room where Jon's body is. Before they could break in, however, Edd returns with Tormund Giantsbane and an army of wildlings. Though Thorne demands that the watchmen stand and fight, they are intimidated into surrender by the giant, Wun Wun. Olly then charges Tormund (likely due to his involvement in the attack on Olly's village), but is quickly overpowered and disarmed. Olly is then led away to the Ice Cells along with Thorne and the rest of the mutineers.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Olly</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOlly</string></dict>
        <key>Orell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.176.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Orell was a wildling and warg, who could assume the consciousness of an eagle that he used for reconnaissance.
            While the massive host of the Free Folk marches out of Skirling Pass through the Frostfangs, Orell scouts the Fist of the First Men by warging into his pet eagle. He discovers dead "crows" - the result of the Battle of the Fist of the First Men.[1]
            OrellÂ is among the party that reaches the Fist of the First Men alongside Jon Snow and Mance Rayder. Here they encounter the bloody aftermath of assault on the Night's Watch by the White Walkers and their army of undead Wights. Except for corpses of horses, there is no sign of any human corpses - which Orell had seen when he scouted ahead earlier by warging into his eagle.[2]
            While climbing the Wall, a crack within the ice causes an avalanche. Losing their footing, Orell yells to Tormund they must cut Jon and Ygritte's rope. Orell eventually cuts the rope, and Jon is able to swing Ygritte and himself to safety before it snaps.[3]
            Orell manages to cheat death, however, warging into the mind of his eagle with his dying breath. As Jon stands over Orell's dead human body, Orell's consciousness controlling the eagle's body attempts to exact revenge by clawing at Jon's face with his beak and talons, but Jon is able to fight him off.[4]
            Jojen Reed mentions to Bran Stark that if one wargs into an animal for too long, they will forget what it was like to be human. As Orell must now stay inside the eagle for the rest of his life, this is presumably what will happen to him.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Orell is a wildling raider in the same band as Ygritte. He has an affinity for animals including his pet eagle.
            Orell is killed in the confrontation with Qhorin Halfhand's scouting party, during which Orell is inhabiting his eagle. A portion of Orell's consciousness remains within the eagle, and develops a deep hatred of Jon. The eagle then aids Rattleshirt in tracking and capturing Jon and Qhorin. Later, shortly before the wildlings arrive at the Fist of the First Men, the eagle attacks Jon, scars his face and attempts to claw his eyes out before Ygritte drives it away.
            Another wildling skinchanger, Varamyr Sixskins, takes control of Orell's eagle, using it to scout Castle Black and spots Stannis's arrival at the Wall. During the battle Melisandre destroys the eagle with her fire magic, driving Varamyr insane and supposedly destroying also the remnants of Orell inside the eagle.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Orell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOrell</string></dict>
        <key>Orys Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.177.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Orys Baratheon was the founder of House Baratheon.
            Orys Baratheon is the founder of House Baratheon and is the distant ancestor of King Robert Baratheon and his brothers, Stannis and Renly.
            During the War of Conquest, he was a commander in the army of Aegon the Conqueror, and was the Conqueror's bastard half-brother. When Aegon invaded Westeros, he sent Orys to seize Storm's End, the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings and capital of the Stormlands. Orys defeated the Storm King, Argilac the Arrogant, and took not only Storm's End but also his sigil (the black stag) and words ("Ours is the Fury"), as well as his daughter Argalia, and his sword, Torment, to cement his rule over the Stormlands. He became the first Lord Paramount of the Stormlands.[2]
            He has an entry in The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms. It reveals that Orys married Argalia, daughter of Argilac the Arrogant, the last Storm King, and that one of his sons died stopping an assassination attempt against King Aenys Targaryen.[3]
            The World of Ice and Fire reveals that Orys Baratheon was Aegon's closest friend and ally. He served Aegon as the first-ever Hand of the King, as well as the commander of his forces. Aegon offered Orys's hand in marriage to the daughter of the Storm King, Argilac Durrandon, but was rebuffed. Angered at the insult of being offered a bastard instead of a king, Argilac cut off the hands of Aegon's envoys.
            When Aegon landed his army at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush, he led a lightning campaign to secure the surrounding area, taking Rosby, Stokeworth, Duskendale and Maidenpool in short order. Orys led the army while Aegon attacked from the skies.
            After this victory, Aegon sent Orys and his sister-wife Rhaenys to take Storm's End. Argilac left his castle to give battle in the open, attacking during a torrential thunderstorm to limit the use of Rhaenys's dragon, Meraxes. However, Meraxes instead fought on foot and was still able to inflict carnage on Argilac's forces. Argilac himself was slain by Orys. Orys negotiated the surrender of Storm's End, with Argilac's daughter Argella delivered to him in chains and naked. Orys treated her kindly and later wedded her.
            Orys continued to serve as Hand of the King for his nephew Aenys I, who succeeded Aegon I upon his death. Orys later died during one of the numerous local rebellions against Aenys I: many lords hoped that with Aegon the Conqueror dead and his weak son on the throne, they might be able to throw off Targaryen rule forever. These rebellions were crushed by Aegon's ruthless younger son, Maegor the Cruel, who succeeded Orys as Hand of the King.[4]
            The relationship between Aegon the Conqueror and Orys Baratheon may be loosely inspired by that of the real-world William the Conqueror of Normandy and Odo of Bayeux, who was the Norman conqueror's half-brother (Orys was rumored to be Aegon's half-brother) and vassal, and upon the conquest of England, was made the ruling earl of an important region of England and was his brother's regent and chancellor in that country.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Orys_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOrysBaratheon</string></dict>
        <key>Ortengryn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.178.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ortengryn was the Maester of Ironrath and a loyal servant to House Forrester.
            Originating from a minor house in the Vale, Maester Ortengryn studied at the Citadel in the hope of being assigned to the Eyrie. But by the time heâd earned enough links on his chain to graduate from acolyte, Jon Arryn had been murdered and the South was in turmoil. The Citadel ultimately assigned Maester Ortengryn to Ironrath, where he soon came to respect the Forrester familyâs honor and integrity. He now serves the Forresters with pride and has become a trusted advisor to Lord Gregor.
            Ortengryn's links in his chain are gold for money and accounting, and silver for medicine and healing.
            Ortengryn is first seen in the great hall when Gared Tuttle, the squire of Lord Forrester, arrives in Ironrath after escaping the Red Wedding. Ortengryn treats Gared's wounds with maggots from an encounter with Bolton and Whitehill men, which results in a leg wound for Gared and the death of one Bolton and potentially one Whitehill soldier. He converses with Gared, giving him condolences for the death of Gared's family, and explaining the implications of Gared's justice for his family, such as Lord Ludd Whitehill demanding justice for the 'murder' of the men. He expresses regret for the death of Gregor and Rodrik Forrester, and Lady Elissa Forrester and Talia Forrester then enter the great hall, wanting to see Gared. After Talia has a brief conversation with Gared, Ortengryn sends her off to bed. He then asks Gared to tell Lady Forrester the final moments of Gregor and Rodrik. When Gared presents the Forrester greatsword, to Ortengryn and Elissa, which Ortengryn promises to give to Lord Ethan.
            Ortengryn is later seen climbing one of the towers of Ironrath with Ethan, discussing the doubt of some members of the Forrester household of his leadership. He motivates Ethan, telling him of his ancestors contributions to the house, such as Thorren and Gerhard, and his own father. He then tells of the Forrester tradition of selecting a Sentinel, the lord's most trusted advisor. They are interrupted however by Royland Degore, who has found a Forrester soldier, Erik, stealing weapons.
            After Ethan makes the decision on the fate of Erik, Ortengryn comforts him. He notes that a Sentinel could help him in a situation like that, and that there are two capable men for that role: Ser Royland or Duncan Tuttle. He then gives Ethan the Bracer of the Sentinel, and advises him to make a decision for the Sentinel at Ethan's first small council meeting. At the meeting, he states Ethan has made his decision and that only one can be it. After your Sentinel is picked, and the council is discussing Ramsay Snow's impeding visit to Ironrath. Ortengryn notes that the Bolton needs the Forresters to harvest ironwood. He also devises a plan for peace by giving the Boltons ironwood for protection. You can choose his plan to deal with Ramsay in the meeting. He is not present at the meeting, however, although Talia does call him for as Ethan is on the ground after being stabbed in the neck by Ramsay.
            When Rodrik Forrester falls from the corpse cart, Ser Royland Degore calls for someone to fetch the maester, and Rodrik goes back unconscious. Rodrik wakes from his unconsciousness temporarily, to see the maester having surgery on him, with Ortengryn's hands bloody and using blades to cut stuff on Rodrik. He notices Rodrik's consciousness, and stops operating to offer the milk of the poppy to him, which he can refuse or accept. Lady Forrester and Duncan enter, with Ortengryn stating he's in a dedicate moment in the surgery. Nonetheless, Lady Forrester runs over to her son, while Ortengryn notes that Rodrik's wounds would have killed any other man and that if he cannot finish the surgery he may die, but if he lives he may never walk again. Rodrik slips back into unconsciousness from the milk of the poppy or the pain, which Ortengryn says before he does.
            Later, when Talia greets Rodrik now awake, she informs him that the maester believes Rodrik's leg may never fully heal.
            Ortengryn is the first of the small council to see Rodrik approaching, and stops their argument. Royland states that they are surprised he is walking, because the maester said it be weeks if he walked, at all. Rodrik can then say the maester doesn't know everything, Ortengryn then lowers his head. Later, when Duncan and Royland are arguing, Ortengryn tries to defuse the tensions, but to no avail. When discussing Rodrik's betrothal, he joins Duncan and Royland in surprise of Elaena Glenmore coming visit to Ironrath. As Royland and Duncan argue about how to deal with the garrison, the maester asks Rodrik to put an end to the tiresome dispute. Lady Forrester asks him to light the ironwood torches.
            When preparing for Lady Elaena's visit, Ortengryn redoes Rodrik's bandages. He also points out to Rodrik that he might wish to remind Elaena that in terms of lineage he was still very much a man and could produce an heir. Lady Forrester silences him before he can finish on these statements.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ortengryn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOrtengryn</string></dict>
        <key>Otto Hightower</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.179.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Otto HightowerÂ was the Hand of the King to bothÂ Viserys I TargaryenÂ andÂ Aegon II Targaryen.
            Otto served King Viserys I Targaryen, as his Hand, from 120 AL until his death. Upon hearing this, his daughter Queen Alicent Hightower, Viserys's wife, ordered that the servant who first saw him dead be put in the Black Cells. Otto then summoned a Small Council meeting, and he demanded that Aegon II Targaryen would be King. However, the small council members were confused, as they had been demanded by Viserys that they must swear fealty to his eldest child Rhaenyra Targaryen. The Master of Coin, Lyman Beesbury, declared this as treason, only to have his throat cut open by Ser Criston Cole, who had previously pointed out that a son comes before a daughter, despite the sucession that the dead king had refused to change. This ended the debate at dawn.
            When the civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons broke out between Aegon and Rhaenyra, Otto used diplomacy to further the interests of the Greens, but although this had not been entirely without success, Aegon had little patience for strategy. One of Otto's final acts as Hand was to build an alliance with the Triarchy across the Narrow Sea, old enemies of Rhaenyra's husband Daemon, but by then, Aegon had grown tired of letting others fight his war for him.
            With his eldest son, Jaehaerys, dead, Aegon was losing in the war. Daemon had managed to capture Harrenhal, while Rhaenyra's son Jacaerys had recruited House Stark of Winterfell, House Arryn of The Eyrie and the other houses of The Vale of Arryn for Rhaenyra. Furious, Aegon dismissed Otto, and appointed Lord Commander Criston Cole as his new Hand.
            Ser Otto was famous for his knowledge. For this ability, he was namedÂ Hand of the King. He is now a warning to future Hands that knowledge is not everything. He served as Hand of the King underÂ Jaehaerys I,Â Viserys I, andÂ Aegon II Targaryen, but was not Hand continuously.
            Otto first served as Hand after the death of Jaehaerys's Hand and son, PrinceÂ Baelon Targaryen. Jaehaerys was devastated by the death of his son and loss of hisÂ beloved wifeÂ earlier, becoming grief stricken, and with his health failing he became bedridden. Otto effectively ruled the kingdom as Hand in the final two years of Jaehaerys's reign while his daughterÂ Alicent HightowerÂ nursed the ailing king.
            Otto continued as Hand to Jaehaerys's successor,Â Viserys I Targaryen. He was father to Viserys's second wife, Queen Alicent. InÂ 109 AC, Otto was removed as Hand for hounding Viserys to declare Alicent's sons the heirs to theÂ Iron ThroneÂ instead of PrincessÂ Rhaenyra Targaryen. Having no place at court anymore, Ser Otto returned toÂ Oldtown. A "queen's party", known as theÂ greens, a group of powerful lords who were friends with Queen Alicent, remained, who supported the rights of Alicent's sons.
            InÂ 120 AC, Otto returned as Hand after LordÂ Lyonel StrongÂ died. When Viserys died inÂ 129 AC, Otto played a crucial role in crowning his eldest grandson as KingÂ Aegon IIÂ in defiance of the last will of Viserys I, which specified Rhaenyra as the successor. This defiance precipitated the civil war known as theÂ Dance of the Dragons.
            The opposing faction, theÂ blacks, included the battle-tested PrinceÂ Daemon Targaryen, who, in the course of his pre-war adventures, had made many foes. Ser Otto had been amongst the first of these. He reached out to other enemies of the prince, theÂ Kingdom of the Three Daughters, as allies. They were crucial in breaking theÂ VelaryonÂ blockade in theÂ Battle in the Gullet.
            Aegon II, however, perceived Otto's diplomacy as slothful at a time when Prince Daemon had capturedÂ HarrenhalÂ and many houses had declared for the blacks. This led to his replacement as Hand by SerÂ Criston Cole, theÂ Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, despite the pleading of Ser Otto's daughter (and Aegon's mother), QueenÂ Alicent Hightower. It was only after his dismissal that his efforts bore fruit.
            Otto was the first to be executed as a traitor byÂ Rhaenyra TargaryenÂ when sheÂ took King's LandingÂ inÂ 130 AC, just as he had predicted.

        <key>Othell Yarwyck</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.180.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Othell YarwyckÂ was the First Builder at Castle Black, a senior position within the Night's Watch.
            Othell Yarwyck is First Builder of the Night's Watch and a member of House Yarwyck, a noble house of the Westerlands sworn to Casterly Rock. He is based at Castle Black and is tasked with organizing the builders in maintaining the Wall and the castles belonging to the Watch.
            Othell Yarwyck is present for the induction of the new recruits at Castle Black. He accompanies Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly into the Haunted Forest to witness them saying their oaths of loyalty to the Watch in front of a heart tree. He is among the first to congratulate them on entering the Watch, and is also present when Ghost returns with a corpse's hand in his mouth.[1]
            The party discover the corpses of Othor and Jafer Flowers and return them to Castle Black. He confirms Sam's discovery that the corpses do not smell, which is odd since they appear to have been dead for weeks. He like Jon is in favor of burning the bodies immediately, but is overruled by Lord Commander Mormont; who desires them to be examined first. [2]
            Othell Yarwyck remains at Castle Black while Lord Commander Mormont leads an expedition beyond the Wall.
            Othell Yarwyck is one of the five black brothers to "judge"Â Jon SnowÂ for his actions during his time with theÂ wildlings. After Maester Aemon dismisses Jon, Yarwyck helps Aemon to his feet and to leave the hall.[3]
            A young boy, Olly, arrives at Castle Black and tells the Night's Watch how a wildling raiding party massacred his village. OthellÂ angrily proposes that they should send a message to the wildlingsÂ by killing the raiders and throwing their bodies off the top of the Wall. Many black brothers agree with him, but Ser Alliser ThorneÂ argues that striking back is exactly what the wildlings want.[4]
            Othell is present when âJon SnowÂ proposes to seal Castle Black's tunnel due to the imminent attack by Mance Rayder's army. Alliser Thorne reminds Jon that the builders are responsible for maintaining the tunnel, and not the stewards. Alliser asks for Othell's opinion on Jon's proposal to seal the tunnel. Othell reluctantly sides with Alliser.[5]
            Othell participates in the Choosing of the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He counts the votes and informs Maester Aemon that there is a tie between Jon Snow and Alliser Thorne, which the Maester breaks by voting for Jon.[6]
            Later, when the newly chosen Lord Commander Snow gives Janos Slynt the command of Greyguard and he refuses it, as it is in ruins, Jon tells Janos that Yarwyck can spare ten of his builders to help him rebuild the fort, and Yarwyck himself agrees. However, Janos repeatedly refuses the command and insults Jon and is executed by Jon for his rebellion.[7]
            Othell is later present in the common hall when Jon informs them of his plan to rescue the wildlings at Hardhome. Othell is vehemently against the idea of bringing the wildlings through the gates, even when Jon informs him that thousands of women and children will die if they do nothing. Othell is unmoved and says it would be better for them to die as it would mean less enemies for the Night's Watch. Stannis Baratheon quietly mutters the word "fewer" to himself, correcting Othell's grammar.[8]
            When Jon Snow returns from Hardhome with thousands of wildlings and lets them in through the Wall, Othell Yarwyck is among the many black brothers who look at the wildlings and even their Lord Commander with disgust.[9]
            Thorne openly admits that he orchestrated Jon's murder, and cites that Yarwyck was one of the conspirators. Yarwyck says nothing and looks down, apparently regretting what he has done. He is later present when Thorne issues his ultimatum to Davos Seaworth and the black brothers still loyal to Jon.[11] When the mutineers try to break their way into the room where Davos and the others are guarding Jon's body, Eddison Tollett returns with the wildling army and orders the mutineers arrested for their betrayal. Yarwyck is among those dragged off to the ice cells.[12] Later when Lord Commander Snow acts out his final order, hanging the conspirators, Yarwyck's final words are a plea to write his mother in White Harbor, asking she be told he was not hanged a traitor, but died honorably fighting the wildlings. Jon gives no indication that he will honor Yarwyck's request and hangs him along with Thorne, Olly, and Bowen Marsh.[13]
            During Season 1 it was believed that Fortune was playing Bowen Marsh, andÂ Dennis McKeever was playing Yarwyck, based on comments by Fortune and McKeever's character deliveringÂ a line said by Yarwyck in the books. Neither of them were absolutely confirmed to be playing these characters, however, as their names were never stated in on-screen dialogue or in the credits. McKeever reappeared in Seasons 2 and 3 in a background role in the Great Ranging, in which Yarwyck didn't partake. In Season 4, Fortune's character was directly identified in on-screen dialogue as Yarwyck, and Michael Condron was subsequently cast as Marsh for Season 5. This establishes that Fortune's character should always be considered to have been Yarwyck, while McKeever was simply playing an unnamed Night's Watch officer. While this might technically be a retcon, Season 1 never absolutely confirmed which characters these actors were playing, so it introduced no internal continuity errors.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Othell_Yarwyck</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOthellYarwyck</string></dict>
        <key>Othor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.181.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Othor was a ranger of the Night's Watch and is killed while beyond the Wall. His body is found and returned to Castle Black where he rises again as a wight before being destroyed by Jon Snow.
            Othor is a ranger in the Night's Watch. He and Jafer Flowers accompanied Benjen Stark's ranging mission beyond the Wall. Both Jafer and Othor are killed while on this mission.
            The corpses of Othor and Jafer Flowers are found beyond the Wall by Samwell Tarly, Jon Snow and a party led by Othell Yarwyck. They return the corpses to Castle Black and suggest they be burned. Lord Commander Jeor Mormont decides to let Maester Aemon examine them first.[1]
            At night, the corpses rise as wights. Othor attacks Mormont, but Jon Snow intervenes and burns the wight, destroying it. Othor's and Jafer's bodies are re-burned the next day. Samwell notes that according to a book he found in Aemon's library, the touch of the White Walkers can animate the dead.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Othor is noted as a big, ugly man who enjoyed singing bawdy songs.
            In the books, where the bodies of Othor and Jafer were brought to Castle Black, both corpses had blue eyes â different from the eye color they had in their lives. In the series, Othor's eyes were blue only while he was fighting Jon.
            When Othor came to life as wight, he killed at least one guard before entering Mormont's quarters. Jon found the body sprawled bonelessly, its head had been twisted completely around.
            Jon's fight against Othor the wight is slightly different than portrayed in the TV series: first, Othor's blue eyes glowed; second, after Jon cut Othor's arm off, the severed limb continued fighting by grabbing at Jon's calf and he barely managed to pry the fingers off his leg, while in the series it simply fell on the floor; third, Jon destroyed Othor not by throwing a lamp directly at him: instead, he snatched the lamp from Mormont, used it to set the drapes on fire, then grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes and whipped them at the dead man, severely burning his fingers while doing so.
            The fight with Othor made Jon realize that Valyrian steel is useless against wights, the same conclusion that Sam reached about dragonglass when fighting against Paul the wight: the only two known materials that are lethal to Others - are ineffective against their minions. Fire is still the only effective weapon against the wights.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Othor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOthor</string></dict>

        <key>Oberyn Martell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.183.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Prince Oberyn Martell, commonly referred to as the Red Viper of Dorne, was a member of House Martell, the ruling family of Dorne, and the younger brother of Doran Martell and the late Elia Martell, and the father of eight bastard girls known as the Sand Snakes. He is well known for his fighting skills, passionate temper, and sexual appetites.
            Prince Oberyn was the younger brother of Prince Doran Martell and Princess Elia Martell, and like most members of House Martell, he was styled "Prince" instead of "Lord". He was nicknamed "the Red Viper" for his knowledge of poisons and for his unusual, deadly style of combat. Oberyn was known for being an accomplished warrior, but he was just as infamous for his sexual appetite, which extends to both men and women; Tyrion Lannister tells Bronn that Oberyn is "famous for fucking half of Westeros". Oberyn's paramour was Ellaria Sand; she is his wife in all but name, and Doran once noted that Ellaria made Oberyn very happy. She was also the mother of four of Oberyn's infamous eight bastard daughters, all of whom he has acknowledged and given his love and care. He named the fifth one, Elia Sand, after his late sister.[1][2]
            When he was a teenager, Oberyn accompanied his sister EliaÂ on a visit to Casterly Rock. While there, Oberyn and Elia were eager to see the "monster" that had just been born. Cersei finally showed them Tyrion, but the Martell siblings were somewhat disappointed to see that heÂ was merely a baby, and somewhat disturbed by Cersei's already strong hatred of him.[3]
            Prince Oberyn trained at the Citadel in his youth, in order to become a maester. Although he ultimately grew bored and abandoned his studies, he managed to forge several links in a maester's chain, and became well versed in the use of poisons in the process. When he was sixteen, an older nobleman caught Oberyn in bed with his mistress and wife, and challenged Oberyn to a duel to first blood. Oberyn won the duel, and several days later the man died from festering wounds, likely because Oberyn had poisoned his blade.[4] Oberyn also travelled to Essos in his youth. For a time, he served in the mercenary company known as the Second Sons. He once wentÂ toÂ the city ofÂ AstaporÂ and saw the Unsullied there, whom he later remarked were impressive on the battlefield, but less so in the bedroom. He lived in Essos for a total of five years.[5] It is implied that Oberyn fought duels in the infamous fighting pits of Meereen, as he mentions to Tyrion that he learned some of his combat techniques "during his years in the fighting pits".[6]
            Despite his wayward ways and liberal attitude towards sexuality, Oberyn was very devoted to his family, telling his lover Ellaria that any other person would always have to wait behind her for his affection. He was very close with his sister, Elia, and took her death very hard. As a result, he had a strong and fierce hatred for House Lannister, especially towards Tywin Lannister, whom he believed ordered his sister's murder. He also developed a resentment toward his deceased brother-in-law Rhaegar Targaryen for (from Oberyn's perspective) being unfaithful to Elia and "stealing away another woman", which in turn led to a war that cost all of them their lives.[1][7]
            Despite their very different personalities, he was also close to his older brother, Doran.
            Tyrion LannisterÂ meets the lords of Dorne outside King's Landing, only to find out that Oberyn will be representing House Martell at the king's wedding, and not his brother, the ruling Prince Doran. The Dornish lords tell Tyrion that Oberyn in fact arrived in the city before dawn. It doesn't take Tyrion long to realize that OberynÂ is in one of Littlefinger'sÂ brothels. Oberyn assists his paramour Ellaria in choosing a whore for her own enjoyment before selecting Olyvar to satisfy himself. Oberyn's fun is cut short when he hears Lannister men singing "The Rains of Castamere", which sends Oberyn into a quiet rage. Before one of them can draw his sword, Oberyn drives his dagger through the man's wrist, though he assures the man's compatriot that he can be saved, if his injury is treated immediately. Tyrion arrives, and interruptsÂ the fight.Â Leaving the brothel, Tyrion asks OberynÂ why he came to the capital. Oberyn, much to Tyrion's discomfort, relates the story of how Gregor Clegane, Tywin's bannerman, raped and murdered Elia Martell and slaughtered her children. He then warns Tyrion that the LannistersÂ aren't the only ones who pay their debts.[1]
            Later, Oberyn attendsÂ Joffrey's wedding, where he meets Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister. When he introduces Ellaria to them, Tywin is tactfully polite but Cersei hypocritically mocks Ellaria's baseborn origins, instigating a debate over the cultural differences between the Dornish and the rest of Westeros - and prompting Oberyn to smugly remind Cersei that her daughter Myrcella is essentially a hostage of the Martells. Oberyn also gives Loras Tyrell a very flirtatious look, which leaves Loras blushing.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Oberyn_Martell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOberynMartell</string></dict>
        <key>Norren</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.184.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Norren was a warrior in the service of House Forrester.
            Norren's family have faithfully served House Forrester for centuries. His squire is Bowen, who views serving him with little joy.
            Norren serves in the Northern army, and fought at the Battle of the Whispering Wood, where he claims to have been an integral part in the capture of Jaime Lannister. While Bowen claims he was so drunk he almost didn't make it out of his tent, and never got near the Kingslayer.[1]
            Shortly before the events of the Red Wedding, Norren is seen outside The Twins boasting to House Forrester's men that he captured Jaime Lannister at the Battle of the Whispering Wood. This was then reduced to an integral part, and then a minor part with Thermund claiming Jaime dragged him across the battlefield on his face, though Norren is still proud of it. The men joke at his expense. Lord Gregor Forrester then emerges from his tent and asks if the men are questioning Norren's honor explaining that his family has served House Forrester well for generations, and House Tully is in his debt claiming they'd never seen a field plowed so well, as the day the Lannister dragged Norren across the battlefield. As the men begin laughing at their Lord's joke Norren joins in after a moment soon after raising his cup in toast after Lord Gregor announces House Forrester has been chosen to ride as the Vanguard for the assault on Casterly Rock. Later, he runs out of wine, and calls for Bowen to go fetch some more who does after getting Gared to join him. As they walk the two squires discuss their back grounds and positions where Bowen reveals his disdain for serving Norren calling him arrogant, a drunk, and a liar.
            Once the slaughter begins, Norren manages to arm himself with an axe and Forrester shield fighting the Frey men alongside his Lord killing several. He is present when Gared returns and informs them he saw Rodrik cut down. If saved Bowen will have made it back to the camp and joins him in fending off the Frey's attack. If Gared left Bowen behind, he will ask about his squire's whereabouts, showing concern for him. After Lord Gregor is shot Norren kills another Frey and urges him to escape while he can. Seeing an opportunity, Lord Forrester and Gared flee, while Norren charges back into the fray. It is left uncertain as to whether Norren got out alive or was killed by the Frey men.
            If Bowen was saved he stays behind with Norren to keep fighting while Gregor, and Gared escape and can be seen at the Battle of Ironrath alone possibly confirming that Norren was killed during the Red Wedding.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Norren</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascNorren</string></dict>
        <key>Oznak zo Pahl</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.185.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Oznak zo Pahl is the champion of Meereen.
            When Daenerys Targaryen arrives at the doors of Meereen, Oznak zo Pahl is sent out as its champion to duel a champion of Daenerys' choosing. He insults her and her Unsullied by urinating in their direction, mocking their status as eunuchs and accusing Daenerys of being a man who hides his genitals in his anus. Daenerys chooses Daario Naharis, the least valuable of her party, to battle him. Daario Naharis defeats him by throwing a knife into the eye of Oznak's horse, causing it to fall and him with it. Pahl attempts to rise, but is quickly decapitated. Daario returns Pahl's gesture by urinating toward Meereen.[1]
            Oznak zo Pahl's taunting of Daenerys, translated:
            Executive producer Dan Weiss came up with the idea to have Oznak's untranslated taunting of Daenerys in Low Valyrian use the dialogue from the French Taunter scene in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Linguist David J. Peterson confirmed this, though he modified a few words to match the scene (referring to Daenerys as the "Dragon Queen" and to "Westeros"). Peterson had to come up with Valyrian words for "hamster" and "elderberry": the word for "hamster" is nÃ½nyghi (which Peterson stated was inspired by the Knights Who Say Ni) and the word for "elderberry" is tomisto, from High Valyrian tÅmÄ«tsos, a reference to Peterson's friend Tommy Lieber.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Oznak zo Pahl is a noble from Meereen and a scion of the House of Pahl. He wields a 14-foot lance striped with the colors of his house (pink and white). It is rumored that he once cut the liver out of a man named Scarb who had looked at a Meereenese lady wrongly. Oznak claimed that he was defending the lady's honor, for Scarb had raped her with his eyes. No one dared to question Oznak's act since his uncle is the richest man in Meereen and his father commands the city guard.
            Oznak is defeated by "Strong" Belwas instead of Daario Naharis, and the events play out slightly different. Daenerys chooses Belwas, a eunuch and former pit fighter, because he is the least important of her protectors, and because if Oznak should fall to such the Great Masters will be shamed, while if Belwas is defeated - it is a poor victory that Meereen can take no pride in. Belwas evades three of Oznak's charges before injuring his mount on the fourth, forcing him to fight on foot. He does not immediately kill the champion, as he allows his opponent to cut his belly once before finishing them off. He decapitates him, before defecating next to his corpse.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Oznak_zo_Pahl</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascOznakzoPahl</string></dict>

He pledges his house to House Stark once more after called upon by Jon Snow.
            Ned Umber is the son of Smalljon Umber and grandson of Greatjon Umber. He seems to be named after Eddard Stark, who was also known as Ned Stark. After the death of his father at the Battle of the Bastards, Ned becomes the new lord  of House Umber and their castle despite being only ten years old.
            Ned is at the council of Northern and Vale lords in Winterfell's main hall held by the new King in the North Jon Snow. Sansa Stark suggests giving the Last Hearth to an ally of Jon Snow, but Jon dismisses this idea, as Ned wasn't to blame for Smalljon Umber's actions. Jon speaks his name and Ned stands up from amongst the other lords, a full head shorter than them and wearing an expression of fear and uncertainty. Jon then motions for him and Alys Karstark to walk forward and stand before him; fearing that he will have them executed, Ned and Alys obey. However, Jon does not show any desire to punish them for their fathers' actions and instead asks them to once more swear fealty to House Stark. Visibly relieved, Alys and Ned draw their swords, kneel before Jon and declare they will serve House Stark "now and always", retaining his position as Lord of Last Hearth.[2]
            Ned is also present when Jon announces his plans to leave for Dragonstone, to make an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen in order to defeat the Night King, and leave Sansa in control of the North.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no member of House Umber whose first name is Ned.

        <key>Mord</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.190.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mord is the turnkey at the Eyrie with whom Tyrion Lannister has to negotiate with him after being thrown into the Sky Cells. He is played by guest star Ciaran Bermingham.
            Mord is the gaoler in charge of the Sky Cells in the Eyrie. He is in the service of House Arryn. He is slow-witted and follows the orders of his "betters."Â  He is not so slow that he does not recognize opportunity when it is presented and he is the only reason Tyrion was able to make his play for freedom.
            Tyrion Lannister is given into Mord's redoubtable care while a prisoner at the Eyrie.[1] While Tyrion is trapped in the Sky Cells he tries to bargain for his freedom. Mord responds by beating him because he has no money to pay with. With great difficulty, Tyrion manages to bargain with Mord to allow him a fair hearing with Lysa Arryn, under the promise "a Lannister always pays his debts". Tyrion is able to manipulate the situation during his audience with Lysa to demand a trial by combat, which is won in his favor by Bronn. Set free, Tyrion asks for his money-purse back from Rodrik Cassel. As Tyrion turns to leave, true to his word, he tosses the gold-filled purse to Mord, who looks back in delightful astonishment as Tyrion exits the Eyrie.[2]
            Actor Peter Dinklage was not wearing padding, and the scene where Mord beats him with a truncheon, even though it was a prop one, left him with bruises.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mord is a petty, dimwitted, and cruel man who delights in tormenting prisoners and telling them how they are going to fall out of the cells to their deaths on the rocks six hundred feet below the castle. He took Tyrion's coat when he first got there and the nights are freezing.
            Mord is described as very unattractive person: he has small dark eyes and rotting brown teeth. The left side of his face is scarred where an axe cut off his ear and part of his cheek. He has a large belly and thick, stubby-fingered hands.
            After Petyr Baelish kills Lysa Arryn and puts the blame on Marillion, Mord tortures Marillion by plucking his eyes and cutting several of his fingers, till he breaks down and confesses falsely that he killed Lysa. When Sansa looks at Mord, she notices that he has gold teeth.
            "Mord" means "murder" in Norwegian, Danish, German, Swedish and Polish, though it is uncertain if George R. R. Martin had any knowledge of this when he created the name.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mord</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMord</string></dict>
        <key>Moro</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.191.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Khal Moro was a Dothraki Khal.
            He is first introduced sitting with his wives and bloodriders in his tent asÂ Daenerys TargaryenÂ is brought as a gift for him by twoÂ of hisÂ warriors. Impressed by her beauty, he circles her, opining that seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time is the best thing in the world, however, his blood riders casually disagree, listing other great things, like killing a rival khal and enslaving conquered people. Moro, obviously mildly irritated by their flippancy, declares that seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time is one of the five best things in the world and makes it clear that it's the end of the discussion.
            As he is about to rip Daenerys's dress off to see her naked body, she firmly tells him to not touch her in Dothraki, surprising everyone as they were unaware she spoke their language. Daenerys then declares her identity, listing off her many titles. Moro, however, simply laughs in response, stating that he will still bed her and she will give him a son. Daenerys firmly turns him down, declaring that she will not bear him or anyone else's children. Intrigued, Moro states that he likes that she has spirit, but his obvious lustful intentions are immediately dashed when she reveals that she isÂ Khal Drogo'sÂ widow. Moro humbly apologizes for his behavior, for it is forbidden in Dothraki tradition to bed a Khal's widow. He then cuts her free of her restraints and gives his word that nobody will harm her. He refuses to bring her back to Meereen, however, as the same laws that protect Daenerys from molestation require that she be brought toÂ Vaes Dothrak to join the dosh khaleen.[1]
            Moro later presides over the khalar vezhven, in this capacity dismissing the death of his warrior Akho as inconsequential to the proceedings. When her case is brought up, Moro advocates for Daenerys to join the dosh khaleen, while some of his rivals suggest handing her over to the Wise Masters, who have apparently offered 10,000 horses in exchange for her. Moro's conciliatory attitude ends, however, when Daenerys declares that none of the Khals are fit to lead the Dothraki, but she is. Moro threatens to have the khals gang-rape Daenerys for her insolence; in response, Dany overturns the braziers, setting the entire Temple ablaze. Moro is one of the few to make it to the door of the Temple, only to find the doors barred from the outside. Daenerys overturns the final brazier, killing Moro in the resulting conflagration.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Khal Moro has appeared only briefly as of yet. In the first novel, he attends the presentation of Daenerys to Khal Drogo - which in the books takes place in Drogo's manse in Pentos - along with his own son, the khalakka Rhogoro. Moro sometimes allied his khalasar with Drogo's for major raids. He shares the name with a Khal of the Century of Blood - Moro, son of Khal Mengo.
            The storyline in which Moro is involved in the show, however, will not appear until the sixth book in the series, The Winds of Winter, which has not been released yet, so he could have a larger presence in that book. It's also possible that his role could be filled by a different khal in the novel.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Moro</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMoro</string></dict>

            Khal Moro laid waste to the Waterfall City of Sathar, after which he renamed it "The Place of Wailing Children". This event made the Sarnori realize just how perilous the Dothraki were, causing them to rally together behind the High King Mazor Alexi.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Moro had all of the men of Sathar put to the sword once he conquered the city, with the women and children being carried off as slaves to the morts in the hill city of Hazdahn Mo, which was a colony of the Ghiscari Empire. He then had the city burned to the ground, renaming it Yalli Qamayi, the place of Wailing Children.
            Six years later, Moro formed an alliance with the King of Gornath by marrying one of his daughters to him, razing Kasath with his aid. Moro was killed by Horro twelve years later.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Moro_(son_of_Mengo)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMoro</string></dict>

            Mors Martell was one of the many nobles who vied for supremacy over the rest of the lords of Dorne. According to tradition, he fell in love with Princess Nymeria, the Rhoynar warrior-queen, the first time he saw her. The two married and joined their strengths, thus allowing House Martell to defeat all rival houses and unify Dorne under their rule. In the Rhoynish fashion, House Martell adopted the title of "Prince" as well as equal rights of primogeniture, regardless of gender.[1] After Mors was killed in battle, Nymeria took over command of his armies and ruled alone for many years.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mors Martell's history is the same. In The World of Ice and Fire book it is revealed that Mors bore the title "Lord of the Sandship" - the seat of House Martell that would become Sunspear - and died in the Third Battle of the Boneway, slain by King Yorick V Yronwood, though Nymeria completed the conquest of Dorne, dubbed by historians as "Nymeria's War", and passed the crown to her daughter by Mors.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mors_Martell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMorsMartell</string></dict>

            When the Dothraki led by Khal Moro destroyed the city of Sathar, the Sarnori assembled under Alexi as their High King. Having gathered a large army to break the power of the Dothraki once and for all, the Sarnori met them in battle in what became known as the Field of Crows. The four Dothraki khals commanded nearly 80,000 horsemen, while the Sarnori had 100,000 foot soldiers, 10,000 armored riders, 10,000 light horsemen and 6,000 scythed chariots.
            The chariots broke through the Dothraki cavalry, and the khalasar of Khal Haro fled the battle after Haro was killed. When the chariots pursued the fleeing cavalry, Alexi and his armored riders followed, the foot soldiers behind them, and the Sarnori appeared victorious. However, the Dothraki had merely set a trap, and the fleeing horsemen turned and fire a volley of arrows at the Sarnori. Two khalasars attacked their flanks while another attacked from the rear, cutting off their retreat. With no escape, Alexi and his troops were destroyed.[1]

        <key>Mero</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.196.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mero was a Braavosi sellsword known as the Titan's Bastard and one of the captains of the Second Sons.
            Mero is one of the captains of the company of sellswords known as the Second Sons. He hails from the Free City of Braavos. His nickname, "the Titan's Bastard", makes reference to the Titan of Braavos, the enormous statue that guards the harbor entrance to the city.
            Along with his co-captain Prendahl na Ghezn and a lieutenant, Daario Naharis, he meets Daenerys in her tent outside Yunkai but snubs her offer to fight for her on the premise that the Second Sons already had a contract with Yunkai. After aiming several lewd comments at Daenerys, which offend Daenerys'sÂ bodyguards so much that Grey Worm offers to cut Mero's tongue out,Â and groping Missandei, he leads the Second Sons out of her tent with a barrel of wine as a token of her willingness to work with them. Despite putting up with his insults while in his presence, the moment he is gone Daenerys orders Ser Barristan SelmyÂ to kill Mero first ifÂ their armies come to battle, to which Barristan replies he will be glad to do so.
            Mero is next seen back at his camp discussing Daenerys with Daario and Prendahl while groping a Yunkish bedslave on his lap. They eventually decide to assassinate her. Mero gives theÂ Yunkish slave three coins to hand out at random to the three Second Sons to decide which of them should do the deed â Daario winds up with the Braavosi coin, leaving the task to him. Later that night, Daario enters Daenerys's tent and produces Mero's head, along with that of Prendahl, and pledges the Second Sons to her cause.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mero's background is the same. He is described as having pale green eyes and a bushy red beard. He is the captain of the Second Sons, though under his leadership the Second Sons' reputation has fallen to the point where none of the Free Cities will hire him any longer.
            In the books, as the Second Sons are a separate company from the Stormcrows â to which Daario Naharis and Prendahl na Ghezn belong â Mero is not killed by Daario, instead he flees when the Stormcrows go over to Daenerys and attack the Yunkish forces. Later he attempts to kill Daenerys, but is stopped and killed by Ser Barristan SelmyÂ (under the name Arstan Whitebeard). He had disguised himself among the freedmen by shaving off his hair and beard.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mero</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMero</string></dict>

            He travels the Kingsroad with his father as part of King Robert Baratheon's retinue.
            When he is encountered by Joffrey Baratheon practicing sword-fighting with Arya Stark, Joffrey confronts him for 'pretending to be a knight'. Despite his protests that the weapon he was using was only a stick, Joffrey forces him to pick it up. Joffrey sadistically begins pressing his sword against the boy's cheek, which prompts Arya to attack him. Mycah manages to escape but later is killed by the Hound under the orders of the prince much to Ned Stark's horror.[1]
            The Brotherhood Without Banners sentences the Hound to trial by combat for Mycah's murder after Arya accuses him.[2]
            He is mentioned by the Hound when he is trying to convince Arya to kill him. He says that Mycah "begged for mercy", that he killed him anyways, and that his saddle "smelled like butcher boy for weeks".[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mycah is thirteen years old. He falls in with King Robert Baratheon's party as it returns to King's Landing from Winterfell and befriends Arya Stark.
            After the Hound defeats Beric Dondarrion, he teases Arya by telling her (without the slightest remorse or regret) "I rode him [Mycah] down and cut him in half, and laughed".

When Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros, King Mern joined forces with Loren Lannister, the King of the Rock, to face Aegon in battle. Their armies met at the Field of Fire, during which Mern himself was killed, and his kingdom fell to Aegon.
            At first the united armies of Lannister and Gardener seemed to be winning, pushing back Aegon's troops. However, once Aegon unleashed his three dragonsÂ -Â Vhagar, Meraxes and Balerion the Black Dread - even the combined might of the Kingdoms of the Reach and the Rock could not stand up to them. Four thousand men perished, consumed by the dragons' fire, earning the site of the battle the name of 'the Field of Fire.' Among the dead were King Mern himself and all of his sons; thus the Gardener dynasty became extinct. Mern's steward, Harlen Tyrell, surrendered Highgarden to Aegon and was named Lord Paramount of the Reach, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South.[1][2][3]
            Seem that King Mern wasn't inclined to a war initially, like it would have been a sure defeat, but is implied that Lord Harlen Tyrell had suggest Mern to going to war to not appear weak and coward, with the intention to reclaim the Reach for himself.[4]

            Mychal Baratheon is an early member of House Baratheon, the son of Orys Baratheon and Argalia Baratheon, and a distant ancestor of King Robert Baratheon and his brothers Stannis and Renly.
            He has an entry in The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, which notes the fact that he, along with all of his ancestors and descendents were born "black of hair".[2]

The page Ned Stark reads from The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms specifies that he was the son of Orys Baratheon, founder of House Baratheon. The full family tree of House Baratheon for all three centuries of its existence hasn't been revealed in the books yet, nor has specific mention been made of Orys' son, so it is possible that reference to Mychal Baratheon is based on notes from author George R.R.

        <key>Malko</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.202.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Malko is the captain of a slaving ship.
            Malko is the captain of a slaving ship operating in Slaver's Bay and the Summer Sea. He speaks the Common Tongue of Westeros and appears to be knowledgeable of Westerosi history, such as Robert's Rebellion and the Siege of Pyke.
            Malko's ship anchors on the shoreline while on a voyage to Volantis so that the slavers can replenish their water supply. The slavers, led by Malko, discover Jorah Mormont and Tyrion Lannister and capture them. Malko plans on using Jorah as a galley slave and orders Tyrion to be killed and his penis cut off, as dwarfs' penises are believed to be magic. Tyrion warns Malko that no merchant will believe him unless he sees the source of the penis. Then he attempts to convince Malko to take them to Meereen to the fighting pits where Jorah can prove his worth. After hearing Jorah killed Qotho, a Dothraki bloodrider, Malko becomes impressed and agrees to take them to Meereen.[1]
            Once he has arrived in Slaver's Bay, Malko proceeds to auction off Jorah while changing details to make his story sound more impressive (and to get a higher price), including Jorah killing Khal Drogo (instead of Qotho) and taking part in the attack on "Spike" while wielding a flaming sword (instead of Thoros of Myr). He manages to sell Jorah to Yezzan zo Qaggaz, a Meereenese Great Master for 20 gold honors. As Yezzan leads Jorah away, Tyrion desperately attempts to also be sold to Yezzan. Malko scoffs at this, saying that at least Tyrion is funny. Tyrion proceeds to gain control of his chain and beat the slaver who was holding him. Yezzan, intrigued with Tyrion, ends up buying him for a single gold honor because he's funny.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character by the name of Malko: he is a condensation into one role of half a dozen separate slaver characters from the books. At Volantis, Jorah and Tyrion board the Selaesori Qhoran, a merchant ship bound to Qarth, since they are told by the widow of the waterfront that the Red Priest Benerro has seen in his flames the ship will reach Slaver's Bay instead. The ship is captured by unidentified Yunkish slavers. Unlike in the show, Jorah fights the slavers and kills three of them before he is overcome. As a result, he is chained to an oar, beaten very severely, starved, and branded with a demonâs mask on his cheek. Tyrion and the rest of the passengers do not resist, and the slavers do not harm them. None of the slavers seeks to castrate Tyrion or kill him. Jorah and Tyrion are offered on a slave auction block set up before the gates of Meereen by the Yunkish Wise Masters.
            The slavers have no idea who Jorah and Tyrion are. Jorah is introduced by the auctioneer simply as "big and strong" man, without any exaggerated descriptions of his deeds; Tyrion and the other companion are introduced as "A pair of dwarfs, well trained for your amusement". When the price offered for them increases to 5,000, Tyrion yells that it is an insult and he is worth much more, and implies that he is a Lannister.
            In the books, instead of making peace with Daenerys, the Yunkai'i decide to lay siege to Meereen with their slave soldiers and along with three mercenary companies - the Long Lances, the Company of the Cat, and the Windblown - as well as forces of Mantarys, Tolos, Elyria, Qarth, and New Ghis, and remain outside the walls after Daenerys announces her marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq to make peace with the besiegers and stop the attacks of the Sons of the Harpy. While slavery remains forbidden in Meereen, it is openly practiced outside its walls, while Daenerys also gave leave for adults to sell themselves into slavery if they so desired.
            One of the slavers who bids on Tyrion and then Jorah is Zahrina, a crone who purchases cheap slaves for the fighting pits, "meat" for the more competent and formidable fighters. After Tyrion and his other companion are bought by Yezzan zo Qaggaz, he persuades Yezzan's overseer Nurse to buy Jorah too.
            As for Malko in the TV show, the Basilisk Isles south of Valyria and Slaver's Bay are a major location of pirate dens, even worse than the Stepstones, preying on ships trying to round the Valyrian Peninsula and selling their crews into slavery. The Basilisk Isles are just off the north coast of Sothoryos (the narrative's fantasy analogue to Africa), and many of its inhabitants are notably dark-skinned. Malko probably isn't from the Summer Islands, which are further west than the Basilisk Isles and whose inhabitants are also black, because the Summer Islanders abhor slavery.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Malko</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMalko</string></dict>

            Ser Meryn Trant is a member of House Trant, a vassal house to House Baratheon. He becomes a knight of the Kingsguard of Robert Baratheon after Robert's Rebellion. He is a successful tourney knight, though Sandor Clegane is scornful of Trant's skills, remarking that "any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants."[1]
            He takes great pride in his status as a knight of the Kingsguard even though he routinely follows orders that break a knight's sworn duty to defend the weak and the innocent without hesitation or question.
            After King Robert's death, the Lannisters seek to ensure Joffrey's ascension to the Iron Throne by making sure Lord Eddard Stark acquiesces, so they send Ser Meryn Trant, with a group of Lannister guardsmen, to apprehend Eddard's daughter Arya, who is having swordfighting lessons with her teacher,Â Syrio Forel. Ser Meryn warns Syrio not to interfere, but the Braavosi defends Arya, armed only with a wooden practice sword, and disables all the Lannister guardsmen, to Meryn's fury and disbelief. Cursing the guards as "bloody oafs", Ser Meryn draws his own sword and engages Syrio. Arya obeys Syrio's instruction to flee, and she leaves them still fighting. Later, while the newly crowned King Joffrey holds court, Ser Meryn stands among the other Kingsguard in the throne room, but Syrio's fate is not mentioned.
            When Cersei dismisses Ser Barristan Selmy as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, the old knight is insulted and draws his sword in fury, inducing Meryn Trant and the rest of the Kingsguard to do the same and to block Ser Barristan's path to the Iron Throne and Joffrey. In response, Barristan sneers that even now he could kill Ser Meryn and the other four Kingsguard as easily as "carving a cake". There is a tense pause in the throne room but in the end Selmy throws his sword at Joffrey's feet and storms out in disgust.[2]
            Ser Meryn is present when Joffrey shows Sansa her fatherâs head on a spike. In return, she tells Joffrey that someday her brotherÂ Robb may bring her Joffrey's head. Joffrey then says his mother has told him that a king should not strike his lady so he orders Ser Meryn to hit Sansa instead. MerynÂ shows no emotion as he does so.[3]
            Ser Meryn guards King Joffrey Baratheon during his Name Day Tournament in the Red Keep. When Ser Dontos Hollard arrives drunk for his bout, Joffrey orders Meryn to pour a barrel of wine down Dontos' throat. Joffrey relents when he is told it is bad luck to kill a man on his name day byÂ Sansa Stark, who convinces him to make Dontos his court fool instead.[4]
            Following Robb Stark's victory over Stafford Lannister at the Battle of Oxcross, King Joffrey has Sansa Stark brought to court to answer for her brother's crimes. He points a loaded crossbow at her and then commands Ser Meryn to beat Sansa but spare her face. Meryn punches Sansa hard in the stomach and then knocks her over using the flat side of his sword.Â Joffrey orders Sansa stripped and Meryn tears her dress from her shoulders. SandorÂ Clegane watches on in disgust at Trant's behavior.[5]
            Tyrion Lannister interrupts the assault on Sansa and asks Meryn what kind of knight beats a helpless girl; he answers with "the kind that serves their king." Bronn sarcastically warns Meryn to be careful of getting blood on his white cloak. Tyrion orders Sansa covered and reminds Joffrey that she is his betrothed. He rebukes Joffrey for absurdly punishing Sansa for events she had no part in. He also notes what became of the Mad King, who also did what he liked until he was killed by Joffrey's uncleÂ Jaime. Meryn warns Tyrion not to threaten the King; Tyrion counters that he is educating his nephew. He instructs Bronn to kill Meryn if he speaks again and points out that that is a real threat. Tyrion helps Sansa up and walks her out of the throne room.[5]
            Ser Meryn, along with the rest of the Kingsguard, is present when Princess Myrcella Baratheon is sent to Dorne alongside her sworn shield and Meryn's sworn brother, Ser Arys Oakheart. When Joffrey provokes a riot, Ser Meryn cuts down several enraged smallfolk before bringing the King to safety. When Tyrion orders Ser Meryn to gather men to help rescue the missing Sansa Stark, he angrily replies that he takes his orders from the king and refuses to go. Joffrey is too busy sulking and doesn't care if Sansa dies.[6]
            Ser Meryn and one of his sworn brothers accompany Cersei Lannister to her brother Tyrion's chambers after the Battle of the Blackwater. They wait outside at Tyrion's insistence. When Bronn and Podrick PayneÂ appear to see Tyrion, the two knights exchange barbs; Meryn is incredulous that Bronn has been appointed a knight for his efforts at the Battle. He sneers that Bronn is merely an upjumped cutthroat, while Bronn, more amused than offended by Meryn's comment, mocks Meryn for being better at "beating little girls than fighting real men", infuriating Meryn.Â Bronn tries to push past for his meeting with Tyrion but Ser Meryn bars his way and threatens to cut off his hand if he tries to enter. The two Kingsguard begin to slowly draw their swords unaware that Bronn also has the knife on his back half drawn. Before they can fight, Cersei reappears and Ser Meryn leaves with her. Later, when Lady Margaery Tyrell visits an orphanage in Flea Bottom on the way to the Red Keep, King Joffrey asks Ser Meryn why they have stopped. Ser Meryn explains and asks the king if he wishes to speak with his betrothed, but Joffrey, afraid of the smallfolk after they rioted, refuses to leave the litter.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Meryn_Trant</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMerynTrant</string></dict>
        <key>Mance Rayder</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.204.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mance Rayder was the leader of the Free Folk, holding the title of "King-Beyond-the-Wall", and a feared opponent of the Night's Watch, which he formerly served in as a black brother.
            Mance Rayder was once a noted ranger of the Night's Watch. He was actually born a wildling and is proud that he has wildling blood in his veins, but as an infant he was left at one of the castles on the Wall to be raised in the Night's Watch.[1]
            As a young man, he deserted his post and fled north of the Wall to join the wildlings.[2] He rose to become the King-Beyond-the-Wall, a title bestowed on a wildling leader who manages to unify all of the tribes under his command. It appears he has held the position of King-Beyond-the-WallÂ for more than a decade, asÂ Ser Alliser Thorne mentions he was King-Beyond-the-Wall during the previous winter.[3]
            Ser Alliser tells Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly that the wildlings under Rayder are hard, skilled men who know their country much better than the Watch does.[3]
            A wildling raiding party takes Bran Stark prisoner near Winterfell. One of their members, Osha suggests taking Bran Stark as a captive to Mance. This suggestion is rejected as the wildlings are fleeing south in terror of the White Walkers.[4]
            Craster tells Lord Commander Jeor Mormont that Mance is assembling an army in the Frostfangs.[5] Varys reports rumors of the wildlings organizing under Mance to the Small Council.[6] Qhorin Halfhand predicts that the wildlings will be more dangerous under Mance because he used to be a man of the Night's Watch and knows their tactics.[7]
            When she is captured, Ygritte points out to Jon Snow that the wildlings chose Mance Rayder to lead them, and he's not "King-Beyond-the-Wall" because his father was. Ygritte also says that Mance Rayder chose to desert from the Night's Watch to join the Free Folk.[8] Ygritte reverses the situation and takes Jon prisoner. She argues to the Lord of Bones that Mance will want to question Jon because he is the bastard son of Ned Stark, so they shouldn't just kill Jon on the spot. The Lord of Bones has also captured Qhorin and they march back to Mance with both captives.
            When Jon Snow slays Qhorin, Ygritte mentions to the Lord of Bones that he can tell Mance Rayder who killed Qhorin. Jon's ropes are cut and they stand before Mance's encampment. [9]
            Jon Snow is brought to the main wildling camp and introduced to Mance Rayder, though Jon initially mistakesÂ Tormund for the King-Beyond-the-Wall, until Mance reveals himself, and asks Jon why he wants to break his vows and leave the Night's Watch to join them. Jon Snow expresses disgust at Lord Commander Mormont'sÂ complacency towards Craster, particularly in regards to Craster's practice of sacrificing his newborn sons to the White Walkers, and he tells Mance that he wishes to join the side that fights for the living.[10]
            As Mance's army marches from the Frostfangs, Mance asks Jon about his killing of Qhorin Halfhand, whom Mance liked. Mance reminds Jon that despite his liking of him he will kill him if he betrays the Free Folk, also revealing to Jon of his Wildling blood. Jon answers he understands what it is like to want to protect one's people. Mance refutes him and rhetorically asks him if he understands how to unite nearly one hundred clans and tribes - Thenns, Hornfoots, Ice-river clans, cave people - that want to massacre each other. He adds that his army speaks seven different languages. He then insists asking Jon how he managed to unite moon worshippers, cannibals, and giants into the same army. Jon admits he doesn't know. Mance answers he told them they were all going to die unless they go south. Afterward, the two join Tormund and Ygritte beside Orell, who is scouting with his eagle. Mance explains Orell is a warg, capable of entering the minds of animals and seeing through their eyes. He then asks Orell what he saw. Orell explains he saw the Fist of the First Men, and dead "crows".[1]"
            Upon arriving at the Fist, Mance and his army discover that the bodies of the Night Watch were gone and the White Walkers had rearranged the dead carcasses of their horses into a complex spiral. Realizing thatÂ Lord CommanderÂ Jeor MormontÂ had lost most of his fighting men, which severely weakened the Watch, he ordered TormundÂ to take twenty men and Jon, and climb the Wall. Their mission was to wait for other parties on the other side and attack Castle Black from the South while he hit them from the North with the main army. When the time would come, Mance would signal them by lighting the 'biggest fire the North has ever seen'.[11]
            Mance meets with Jon Snow the morning after Battle of Castle Black. He is disappointed that Jon's true allegiance was with the Night's Watch all along. Mance then asks Jon about his lover, Ygritte. Jon informs Mance of her death during the battle, but admits he was not the one to kill her. Jon and Mance share a drink and Mance admits that Jon and his brothers fought well. Mance questions Jon about the fate of the giant that entered Castle Black's tunnel and never came back out. Jon tells him that the giant was killed by his friend Grenn, who was also slain. Jon wants Mance to order his wildling army to return to their homes, but Mance knows that the Night's Watch is low on oil, arrows, and men. Mance also reveals that he sent a force of 400 wildlings to climb the Wall five miles west of Castle Black, where it is unmanned; it is now only a matter of time and casualties.Â Mance offers Jon an ultimatum; open the tunnel, let the wildlings pass the Wall, and no one else will die. If they refuse, the wildlings will massacre the remaining garrison in Castle Black. Mance's real goal is not to destroy the Watch (despite his long-standing feud with them), but to get his people on the opposite side of the Wall from the oncoming White Walkers; he references the motto of Jon's family, "winter is coming".Â Jon eyes a knife that is nearby him in the tent, clearly giving away his true intentions to Mance. He asks Jon if he is capable of killing a man that has shared food with him and offered him reasonable peace terms.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mance_Rayder</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascManceRayder</string></dict>
        <key>High Septon </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.205.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>This High Septon (previously known as Maynard before his ascension as High Septon) served around the time of Robert's Rebellion. During his tenure, he issued an annulment to the marriage of Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and Princess Elia Martell and oversaw the secret wedding ceremony of Prince Rhaegar to Lyanna Stark in Dorne. Maynard eventually died as a High Septon had succeeded him.[1]
            The man known as Maynard eventually came to be chosen as the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven by the Most Devout around the time of Robert's Rebellion. Shortly before the outbreak of the rebellion, Maynard issued an annulment for the marriage of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and Princess Elia Martell, overseeing the secret marriage ceremony of Rhaegar to Lyanna Stark in Dorne.[1] He eventually died as another High Septon was chosen.
            Gilly reads to Samwell Tarly some information recorded by Maynard, such as the number of steps in the Citadel, the number of windows in the Great Sept of Baelor and his own bowel movements. Samwell finds all of this information useless, though when Gilly reads about the annulment and secret wedding that Maynard performed, neither of them realize its importance.[1]
            When Samwell arrives at Winterfell, he meets with Bran Stark, who confides in Sam that Jon Snow is not the son of his father, Eddard Stark, but the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and his aunt Lyanna Stark, and thus is Jon Sand. Samwell reveals High Septon Maynard's annulment of Rhaegar's marriage to Elia Martell to Bran, however, and, knowing of Bran having the power of greensight, urges Bran to look into the past to confirm all of this. Bran uses the sight to watch Maynard wed Rhaegar and Lyanna and learns that they were actually in love with each other. He further discovers that their son is named Aegon Targaryen, and is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, over his aunt Daenerys.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R.R. Martin, there is no High Septon who is remembered as High Septon Maynard. High Septons abandon whatever names they had before, and thus they have no names and are simply remembered by the time during which they served as the head of the Faith of the Seven. There was, of course, a High Septon during the time of Robert's Rebellion, though like all other High Septons, his name is unknown. There has been no mention of the High Septon around Robert's Rebellion issuing an annulment to Rhaegar and Elia's marriage and remarrying Rhaegar to Lyanna. Rhaegar and Elia already had two children, Rhaenys and Aegon, while Lyanna was betrothed to Robert Baratheon, so it is unclear how an annulment could have been issued if one was.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Maynard_(High_Septon)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHighSepton</string></dict>
        <key>Maelys Blackfyre</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.206.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Maelys Blackfyre, better known as Maelys the Monstrous, was called "the Monstrous" in part due to his freakishly large size and strength, but also due to the fact that he had a small vestigial second head sprouting out of the side of his neck - the remnant of a twin that he had absorbed in the womb.[1]
            Maelys Blackfyre was the last of the Blackfyre Pretenders to the Iron Throne. Like previous members of House Blackfyre, he proclaimed himself the rightful king as a descendant of Daemon Blackfyre, bastard son of King Aegon IV Targaryen, while the main Targaryen line descended from Aegon IV's lawful son King Daeron II Targaryen. Maelys rallied an army of mercenaries in the Free Cities and began a conquest of the Stepstones as a prelude to invading Westeros itself. The Targaryens attacked the Stepstones before he could launch the invasion, leading to the War of the Ninepenny Kings. This conflict ended when Maelys was killed in the Stepstones by the young Ser Barristan Selmy, extinguishing Daemon Blackfyre's line and ending further threat of Blackfyre pretenders.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Maelys Blackfyre was the last male descendant of Daemon Blackfyre. He had a huge upper body and a second head sprouting from his neck. This was said to be the head of his twin whom he had absorbed in the womb, earning him the nickname "Maelys the Monstrous".
            Maelys was named Captain-General of the Golden Company after killing his cousin Daemon when they fought for the position, becoming a kinslayer for the second time, although this time by choice. The freakishly strong Maelys killed Daemon's horse with a single mighty punch, then twisted Daemon's head around and tore it bare-handed from his shoulders.
            During the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Maelys was one of the Band of Nine, a group of merchants, sellswords, and pirates who joined forces to carve kingdoms out for themselves. After conquering the Disputed Lands, Tyrosh and the Stepstones, Maelys convinced the other members of the band to attack Westeros and aid him in retaking what he claimed was his birthright. However, the Targaryens acted swiftly and sent their own force out to the Stepstones to meet him. There, Maelys was slain by Ser Barristan Selmy in single combat on the Stepstones, ending the Blackfyre pretensions to the Iron Throne.
            The exact line of descent from Daemon I to Maelys is unclear. Daemon had seven sons and several daughters. Based on chronology, he was apparently Daemon I's grandson, but it isn't known from which of his children.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Maelys_Blackfyre</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMaelysBlackfyre</string></dict>
        <key>Murmison</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.207.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Septon Murmison was a septon during the reign of Aenys Targaryen.
            Murmison officiated the wedding of Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaena, the son and daughter of King Aenys. The Faith Militant and the clergy of the Faith of the Seven objected to this incestuous union, and rebelled against the crown, leading to the Faith Militant uprising.
            Murmison himself was seized by the Faith Militant for his role in the marriage, scourged with whips, and killed.[1]
            The video featurette on the Faith Militant uprising seems to imply that the Faith Militant simply scourged Murmison with whips - actually, the Faith Militant dragged Murmison from his palanquin as he was being carried through the city, and tore him to pieces.
            Murmison was a reputed miracle worker, and Aenys even appointed him Hand of the King in an attempt to placate the Faith of the Seven - though this did not succeed, and anyone should have known that aiding Aenys's foolish decision to have his own children marry would anger the Faith into open revolt. Murmison is therefore remembered as one of the worst Hands ever, and by the end the realm was praying for his demise.
            When Aenys first took the throne he retained his father's last Hand of the King, Alyn Stokeworth, but he died in one of the localized rebellions that broke out after his coronation; Maegor quickly succeeded in crushing a different rebellion, so Aenys happily named his half-brother as his new Hand. Maegor served as Hand for another two years or so and for a time all seemed well, but Maegor increasingly grew frustrated that he could produce no children with his first wife, Cerse Hightower - nor could he get an annulment, because she was the High Septon's own niece. As Aenys and his own wife kept producing more healthy children, driving Maegor even further back in line of succession, he could bare it no longer, and polygamously took a second wife, Alys Harroway. The Faith was also upset with the Targaryens' past history of polygamous marriages, not to mention the personal insult to her uncle the High Septon. Even the politically unskilled Aenys realized he had to do something, so he had Maegor exiled to the Free Cities and named Septon Murmison as his new Hand. This at least kept the Faith from openly revolting for a time - until Aenys grew so aloof and prideful that he stupidly decided to marry his eldest son and daughter to each other. Murmison was expelled from the Faith for performing the marriage, and within a fortnight he was killed in the streets by the Faith Militant.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Murmison</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMurmison</string></dict>

            Prince Maron's marriage to Princess Daenerys is mentioned in House Targaryen's entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Prince Maron married Princess Daenerys as part of the marriage pact that brought Dorne under the rule of the Iron Throne.

        <key>Marillion</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.209.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Marillion is a singer in the Seven Kingdoms. He has his tongue cut out by Ser Ilyn Payne on the orders of King Joffrey Baratheon for writing and performing a limerick about Joffrey's parents.
            Marillion is a troubadour and singer wandering the Seven Kingdoms and selling his skills in return for bed, board and coin.
            Marillion is entertaining the patrons of the Crossroads Inn when Catelyn Stark and Ser Rodrik Cassel arrive. His offer to perform for them is rebuffed, as are his attempts to impress Tyrion Lannister when he arrives. He witnesses the Lady Catelyn taking Tyrion prisoner with the help of some of her father's bannermen.[1]
            Sensing the potential for a great song or story, he decides to accompany Catelyn's party as they travel to the Eyrie. He works on a song about Tyrion's capture along the way. He survives an attack by the hill tribes and reaches the Eyrie safely with the rest of the party.[2]
            Marillion travels back to King's Landing and is brought before King JoffreyÂ for performing a song mocking the late King Robert and QueenÂ Cersei at a localÂ tavern. Joffrey asks whether Marillion prefers to keep his fingers or his tongue, and stunned by fear stammers out that every man needs hands.Â Joffrey orders Ser Ilyn Payne, the royal executioner, to remove Marillion's tongue. The guards seize him, and as Marillion begs for mercy, Payne cuts out his tongue in front of the entire horrifiedÂ court.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Marillion is a talented musician but also arrogant: he is both vain about his skills and his good looks. He is searching for a lord or lady who will be his patron.Â Marillion meetsÂ Catelyn, Tyrion and Bronn at the Crossroads Inn. His attempt to perform a song for Catelyn in return for a silver is rebuffed. He then spots Tyrion and offers to sing about his father's victory at King's Landing; Tyrion replies that this would be sure to spoil his supper. After Tyrion is taken prisoner by Catelyn, Marillion accompanies the party toÂ the EyrieÂ as depicted in the TV series. En route,Â he endeavors to compose a song about the episode, to Tyrion's irritation.
            Marillion remains at the Eyrie asÂ a favorite ofÂ Lysa ArrynÂ after the departure of Catelyn and Tyrion. Soon the entire Vale grows to hate him, except Lysa and her son, mainly because he sexually harasses the maids and composes mocking songs about the nobles. Anyone who complains to Lysa about him gets fired. He sings Robin to sleep every night, and tweaks the noses of Lysa's suitors with verses that mock their foibles. Lysa showers him with gold and gifts; costly clothes, a gold arm ring, a belt studded with moonstones, a fine horse. She has even given him her late husband's favorite falcon. It all serves to make Marillion unfailingly courteous in Lysa's presence, and unfailingly arrogant outside it.
            Marillion is present at the wedding of Lysa and Petyr Baelish. After the bedding he gets drunk and tries to rape Sansa Stark. Lothor Brune, who has been given orders from Petyr Baelish to watch Sansa, prevents this and wounds Marillion. The maids in the Eyrie do not have Lothor Brune to defend them from Marillion's unwanted advances, though. SansaÂ wonders why the gods would have given such a lovely voice to such a wicked man.
            After Lysa spotsÂ Petyr kissing Sansa, she has Marillion bring Sansa to her. She blames Sansa for seducing Petyr and threatens to throw her through the Moon Door. As they struggle, Marillion plays the harp and sings, drowning out Sansa's pleadings. Just as Sansa almost falls, Petyr arrives. He saves Sansa and reassures Lysa. Then he throws Lysa through the Moon Door, calls the guards and tells them that Marillion killed Lysa.
            Marillion is thrown into a sky cell and is tortured by Mord. His eyes are plucked and several of his fingers are cut. Finally he breaks down and confesses that he killed Lysa in the presence of Lord Nestor Royce and other nobles from the Vale. Since Marillion is already despised by many nobles because of his arrogance and mocking songs, they readily accept his confession and do not suspect Petyr. Later, Sansa assures Robin that Marillion has died, although she did not actually see him die and was only told by Petyr. Robin insists that he can still hear Marillion singing at night, though.
            In the book, the bard who gets mutilated at the order of King Joffrey for the song about King Robert, the boar and the lions, is an unnamed character.
            According to George R.R. Martin, the character was not named after the band, which he had never heard of prior to writing the first book.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Marillion</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMarillion</string></dict>

            Mag is a leader among the giants that joined the Free Folk army united by Mance Rayder. Mance refers to him as the "king" of the giants, last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years to before the arrival of the First Men in Westeros.[1]
            During the Battle of Castle Black, Mag approaches the Wall on the back of a mammoth. He rides up to the front gate and dismounts, at which point he and Dongo take the mammoth and turn it around while several wildlings tie ropes to it, then they tie the other end of the ropes to the gate's supports. While the mammoth tries to pull the gate open, men of the Night's Watch throw down flaming barrels of tar, which explode and drive the mammoth off. Dongo attempts to chase after it, but this brings him within the firing arc of a large ballista mounted atop the Wall. The ballista bolt impales him from behind and he is killed.
            Mag is enraged at the death of his fellow giant and bellows out a fearsome cry. His already incredible strength swelled with anger, Mag manages to lift the massive gate with his bare hands. He succeeds in passing underneath, though it slides closed again when he releases it. Mag then charges through the icy tunnel to the portcullis in the middle. Grenn, Donnel Hill, Cooper, and three others are waiting for him and terrified, but Grenn rallies his men by leading them in reciting the oath of the Night's Watch, finishing just as Mag collides with the gate.
            After the battle ends, Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly find Mag's body in the tunnel beneath the Wall, along with those of the men he fought, who successfully held the gate at the cost of their own lives.[2]
            When Jon treats with Mance in the wildling camp, Mance asks what happened to the giant who managed to get inside the gate, but who never came out. Jon explains that he died, killing six black brothers including Jon's friend Grenn. Saddened, Mance tells Jon that the giant's name was Mag the Mighty, the giants' king - the last of a bloodline which stretched back to long before the arrival of the First Men in Westeros. In mutual respect, Mance and Jon drink to the memory of both Mag and Grenn.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg is better known as Mag the Mighty. As giants in the novels are more ape-like, Mag the Mighty is described with a grey pelt streaked with white (somewhat like a silverback gorilla). He dies fighting Donal Noye, the blacksmith at Castle Black, in single combat. Noye's role defending the tunnel from Mag was given to Grenn in the TV series.
            Mag is one of the largest and strongest giants, and seems to act as a leader among them. In the TV series, Mance simply says that Mag was the king of the giants, but in the books Tormund explains to Jon that giants have no kings, not anymore than mammoths do. The human wildlings simply took to informally calling Mag the "king of the giants" because the other giants seem to follow him. Even the wildlings know practically nothing about the social bonds that exist among the giants, if any. Thus it is unclear if Mag is actually a hereditary chieftain, or a chosen chieftain, or if he has no formal leadership position at all, and the other giants simply tend to follow his lead.
            Giants can talk (though currently they only know the Old Tongue), but even wildlings who have conversed with them don't fully understand the giants. Jon first sees Mag when he enters Mance Rayder's camp, and Mag is leading the other giants into the camp while mounted on their mammoths. Tormund greets Mag (speaking to him in Old Tongue) and says that Mag asked if Jon was a girl that Tormund had taken as a new bride. Jon is confused, and asks if Mag has mistaken him for a girl, because he is currently cleanshaven. Tormund says that he isn't sure, as Mag may never have actually seen a cleanshaven boy before - but on the other hand, Mag might also have been making some sort of bizarre joke, given that when Mag said this he let out a rumbling belch that Jon realized was laughter. The wildlings don't understand giant social structure much better than they do giant humor.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mag_Mar_Tun_Doh_Weg</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMagMarTunDohWeg</string></dict>

            Matthar is present during the speech Lord Commander Jeor Mormont gave to the "graduating" recruits. Matthar is assigned to the Rangers.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Matthar is also called Matt. Like Grenn and Pyp, he becomes friends with Jon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Matthar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMatthar</string></dict>
        <key>Matthos Seaworth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.215.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Matthos Seaworth was the son of Ser Davos Seaworth and a squire and scribe to Stannis Baratheon.
            Matthos is present during the ritual burning of the images of the Seven, conducted by Melisandre, as offerings to the Lord of Light. Like the rest of the assembly, Matthos chants praises to the eastern god.[4]
            Inside the castle of Dragonstone, Stannis holds a meeting in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Matthos reads aloud from a letter that he has prepared stating Stannis's claim to the Iron Throne. Stannis objects to the use of âbeloved brotherâ to refer to Robert, which Ser Davos calls harmless courtesy to no avail. Matthos continues to detail the illegitimacy of Joffrey Baratheon as a bastard born of incest between Queen Cersei and Jaime Lannister. Stannis insists that Jaime be called the Kingslayer and that he receive his title as a knight. Matthos finishes reading and Stannis says that Eddard Stark made a mistake by not telling more people when he learned the truth about Joffrey. He orders copies of the letter to be sent to every corner of the realm from the Arbor to the Wall. Stannis says that the time has come to choose and that he wants no man to be able to claim ignorance.[4]
            Matthos remains while Davos fails to convince Stannis of seeking an alliance with either his brother Renly or Robb Stark and Maester Cressen attempts to poison Melisandre and only succeeds in dying while the Red Priestess survives unscathed.[4]
            Davos and Matthos meet with the Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan on the beach of Dragonstone. Davos promises that Salladhor will be paid a fortune in gold when they take King's Landing. Salladhor points out that Stannis has the smallest army of the claimants to the Iron Throne and wonders why he should fight for the king with the smallest chance of victory. Davos tells him that it is a smart gamble to back Stannis because Stannis is a proven battle commander. He adds that Renly and Joffrey have never fought before. Davos adds that Stannis has just begun the fight and expects more of his bannerman to join his cause because he is the most honorable man in the Seven Kingdoms. Salladhor notes the irony of a smuggler vouching for the honor of a king.[5]
            Matthos warns Salladhor to mind his words, calling him a pirate. Davos silences his son and Salladhor says that he was not insulted and asserts his pride in his reputation as an excellent pirate. Salladhor asserts that he does not sail for promises. Davos challenges this, explaining that Salladhor sails on a promise of ships to plunder every time he leaves port. Salladhor says that promise always comes true and Davos says that his promise is the same. Davos points out that Salladhor is not a young man and that pirate's lives are short. Salladhor jokes that only the clever pirates grow old. Davos suggests that Salladhor could continue to steal from cargo ships and live an easy life while it lasts but that he is offering a harder alternative with greater rewards. He promises riches and fame. Salladhor says that he has a good name for songs and then tells Davos that he wants Queen Cersei.[5]
            He says that he will lend his 30 ships provided he can sleep with Cersei when they take King's Landing. Matthos is annoyed by Salladhor's selfishness and says they are not fighting for Salladhor to rape the Queen. Salladhor makes the distinction that he does not intend to rape her and jokes that Matthos has not experienced his persuasiveness. Matthos insists that Stannis has a divine right to rule and Salladhor is dismissive of the claim, saying that he has heard similar all over the world. Matthos turns away and Davos says that he cannot promise the Queen, only the gold and glory. Sallashor asks if Davos believes that Stannis can win and Davos says that Stannis is the âone true king.â Salladhor contrasts Davos's loyalty to Stannis against their history together; Stannis chopped off Davos's fingers for smuggling. Salladhor says that he will sail with Davos because Davos is the most honest smuggler he has ever met and asks Davos to make him rich. They shake hands and Salladhor leaves.[5]
            Matthos asks Davos when Stannis will set sail. Davos says that it will be when Stannis's god wills it. Matthos takes offense and says that the Lord of Light is his god and Davos's god too. He urges Davos to learn to read so that he can experience the holy books for himself. Davos expresses his doubt in the power of prayer. Matthos says that Davos has always returned home. Davos says that he did not pray but Matthos counters that he always prayed for Davos to return. Davos says that he will put his faith in Stannis because of the opportunities he has given their family. Matthos says that Stannis is only a man and Davos warns him not to tell Stannis that.[5]
            Davos and Matthos arrange model ships on the Painted Table. Stannis and Melisandre arrive and Davos reports his success recruiting Salladhor. Stannis is doubtful of their capability, saying that pirates prefer to fight unarmed men. Davos deadpans that it is the wiser choice and Stannis counters that they will not have a choice. Stannis asks Davos if he trusts Salladhor. Davos replies that he is an old friend and that they have known each other for thirty years but that he has never trusted Salladhor. Davos reassures his King that Salladhor will follow the scent of gold. Stannis promises that Salladhor will have his share if he gets the job done and dismisses the men. As they leave Melisandre stops Matthos and whispers in his ear, "Death by fire is the purest death."[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Matthos_Seaworth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMatthosSeaworth</string></dict>
        <key>Lothar Frey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.216.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lothar Frey was one of the many sons of Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing and head of House Frey. He was often referred to as "Lame Lothar" due to the pronounced limp he has in his left leg.
            Lothar is a son of Walder Frey, the Lord of the Crossing. He is the steward of the Twins, managing the day-to-day running of the castle. He often plans and organizes the fine details to achieve his father's goals.
            Lothar travels to Riverrun with Lord Walder's bastard son, Black Walder Rivers, and meets with King Robb Stark and his advisors to discuss the reforging of the Stark-Frey alliance for Robb's planned attack on Casterly Rock. The Freys carry Lord Walder's demands, which includes a formal apology from Robb, the castle of Harrenhal and all of its lands and incomes, and for Edmure Tully to marry Roslin, one of his daughters. Edmure is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met, but is eventually convinced to go through with the arrangement.[1]
            Lothar hires a group of assassins to pose as musicians at Edmure and Roslin's wedding. Talisa Stark comments on their talent, and Lothar replies that they should want to be good due to their cost. After the bedding ceremony, Lord Walder rises to make a toast to Robb and offer a marriage gift to his Queen, signaling Lothar to draw a knife from his sleeve and repeatedly stab the pregnant Talisa in the stomach, killing her and her unborn child. He presumably participates in the ensuing massacre.[2]
            Lothar and Black Walder inform their father that Brynden Tully has retaken Riverrun, and of the opposition they face from other Riverlands houses and the Brotherhood Without Banners. Walder admonishes his sons for letting the Blackfish slip through their fingers at the Red Wedding, and orders them to retake Riverrun by using the captive Edmure for bargaining with. He also tells Lothar to present Brynden with the knife he used to kill Talisa Stark and her unborn child.[3]
            Lothar and Black Walder command the Second Siege of Riverrun. They prove to be incompetent commanders and fail to secure their flanks or to dig trenches. In an attempt to force the Blackfish to surrender, they force Edmure to wear a noose around his neck and threaten to kill him. However, the Blackfish is undaunted and calls their bluff. Later, House Lannister reinforcements arrive under Jaime Lannister and Bronn. Jaime chastises the Freys for their incompetence and takes command of the siege. He also orders Lothar and Black Walder to feed and wash Edmure. When Black Walder refuses, Jaime backhands him across the face and informs the Freys that they can return home if they do not agree with his methods. Lothar is apologetic and sycophantic in contrast to his half-brother.[4]
            Lothar is later present at the Twins, where the Freys and the Lannisters celebrate their successful siege of Riverrun. He is afterwards killed by Arya Stark, who presumably learns (while disguised as a servant) of how he killed her pregnant sister-in-law. She minces his flesh and bakes him into a pie together with Black Walder, whichÂ she then servesÂ to their father before slitting his throat, as Black Walder did to her mother.[5]
            Lothar and Black Walder's remaining male family members are poisoned by Arya, who hosts a banquet using the face of their father.[6]
            When asked by Hot Pie if she has made any pies recently, Arya repsonds with "a few", referring to the deaths of Lothar and Black Walder.[7]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lothar Frey is often referred to as "Lame Lothar", on account of his crippled leg, and serves as the Steward of the Twins. He is the twelfth son of Lord Walder Frey, the first from his marriage to his fourth wife, Lady Alyssa Blackwood.
            Lothar is described as plump, with close-set eyes, a pointed beard, and dark hair in ringlets to his shoulders. His leg was twisted at birth. Unlike the TV version, he is intelligent and cunning despite his handicap. As Steward of the Twins he holds the important position of overseeing the day-to-day running of his father's castle. When it comes to politics or war, Walder Frey determines the general course that House Frey will take, but it is often Lame Lothar who then plans and organizes the fine details to achieve his father's goals. Thus he is one of the major ringleaders within House Frey.
            While courteous on the surface, Lothar can also be extremely vicious. After his father decided to betray the Starks, Lame Lothar handled most of the specific planning for the ambush (consulting with Roose Bolton), appointing the specific tasks that would be followed out during the attack. It was his idea to hire the sellswords disguised as musicians to play "The Rains of Castamere" to signal the start of the Red Wedding massacre. He also has the idea of rigging the tents in the Stark's camp to collapse, trapping the soldiers inside as they're set alight. Even other members of his family believe him to be far more dangerous than he outwardly appears.
            Lothar doesn't kill Robb's wife in the books because she is not even present at the Red Wedding. Robb's wife in the books is Jeyne Westerling (who was changed to "Talisa Maegyr" in the TV version), and she never became pregnant by Robb in the books. Robb left her for safety at Riverrun before traveling to the Twins with the rest of the Stark army. Richard Madden (Robb Stark) explained that the TV series simply killed off Talisa at the Red Wedding along with everyone else, because otherwise viewers would hold out hope that she would give birth to a son that would avenge Robb just as viewers used to think that Robb would live to avenge his father Eddard - they wanted to make it clear that they are avoiding such narrative clichÃ©s.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lothar_Frey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLotharFrey</string></dict>
        <key>Lothor Brune</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.217.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lothor Brune is a freerider in the service of Lord Petyr Baelish.
            Lothor Brune participates in the tourney of King Joffrey Baratheon's sixteenth nameday. He is set to duel Ser Dontos Hollard, but the fight is forfeited when Ser Dontos appears drunk.[1]
            In A Song of Ice and Fire, Lothor Brune is a relative of House Brune of Brownhollow. He is a quiet, loyal man of middle age described as having has a squashed nose, a square jaw and grey hair. He is stocky and strong, and while not a handsome man he is not ugly either. In the books he was also present at the Tourney of the Hand, defeating Jory Cassel on a judgment by the King, tied with Ser Aron Santagar and lost to Ser Robar Royce. He tips off Petyr Baelish about Sansa Stark's request to spare Ser Dontos at King Joffrey's 13th nameday. He also takes part in the Battle of the Blackwater and is awarded with a knighthood afterwards, earning the nickname "Apple-Eater" for capturing a knight of House Fossoway and killing two more on the battlefield.
            When Ser Dontos spirits Sansa out of King's Landing after the Purple Wedding, Lothor is present on Petyr's ship, and commanded the team of crossbowmen that killÂ Dontos Hollard at Baelish's order (coincidentally, the same man Lothor was supposed to face at Joffrey's tournament). Lothor throws a burning torch on the rowing boat after Dontos is murdered, ensuring that his body is never recovered. He accompanies Littlefinger to his keep at the Fingers and later to the Eyrie.
            In the books, Joffrey's nameday tournament in which Dontos and Lothor are set to fight is held between men fighting on horseback. Possibly due to budgetary and time constraints, in the TV series they are preparing to fight on foot. This makes it somewhat of a misnomer that Lothar is specifically introduced as a "freerider" but he isn't fighting on horse.
            While Sansa stays at the Vale, she notices Lothor is fond of Mya Stone, Robert Baratheon's eldest bastard (has not appeared so far in the TV series). She thinks Lothor would be a good match for Mya.
            Lothor is present when Harrold Hardyng, to whom Littlefinger plans to marry his "daughter", talks rudely to her, nearly bringing her to tears. Later, Lothor comforts Sansa by commenting "Harry the Heir? Harry the Arse, I say. Heâs just some upjumped squire". Sansa thanks him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lothor_Brune</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLothorBrune</string></dict>
        <key>Lorren</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.218.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lorren was a veteran ironborn raider dubbed Black Lorren.
            Lorren is a famous ironborn raider, noted for his experience and ferocity in battle. He is loyal to House Greyjoy, the rulers of the Iron Islands.
            When Theon Greyjoy tries to take command of his crew and his ship, the Sea Bitch, Lorren mocks Theon by saying he doesn't need Theon to tell him how things are done, and that he could take on the job as the Captain for himself.[1]
            Lorren is among Theon'sÂ ironborn who seize Winterfell. He captured Ser Rodrik Cassel and brought him before Theon, who brutally executes the defiant Rodrik.[2]
            When Bran and Rickon Stark later escape with Osha and Hodor, Theon initially blames Lorren, who counters that Theon let his guard down with Osha by having sex and sleeping with her the night before. Theon angrily beats up Lorren in front of the rest of the ironborn for his comments.[3]
            Lorren is present for Theon's speech when Northmen lay siege of Winterfell. Aware of the terms offered to the invaders, he doesn't share the enthusiasm shared by the rest of his comrades. After Theon is knocked out by Dagmer, he admits he couldn't wait for Theon to shut up.[4]
            Balon Greyjoy receives a letter from Ramsay Snow demanding that he withdraw all Ironborn from the North, which also reveals that Lorren and the other ironborn at Winterfell were flayed alive by Ramsay and the House Bolton soldiers despite Robb Stark's promise of mercy.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Black Lorren is regarded as one of the most dangerous and formidable ironborn raiders, second only to Andrik the Unsmiling. He's described as a squat, thick man with a long black beard.
            When Theon goes to search for the Stark boys, he gives Lorren command over Winterfell and its residents as castellan. While Ser Rodrik is besieging Winterfell, it is Lorren who urges Theon to fight to the bitter end, but Theon prefers instead to parley with the besiegers. Although Lorren does not actually defy Theon like in the show, he grows to despise him for his behavior, as it is considered weakness and cowardice in the eyes of ironborn.
            When Ramsay and his men turn on Theon and sack Winterfell and kill the ironborn, Lorren fights bravely; it takes four men to kill him. His body is found surrounded by several dead Dreadfort soldiers, indicating that he has taken some of his killers with him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lorren</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLorren</string></dict>

        <key>Lommy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.220.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lommy, called Lommy Greenhands, was an orphan from King's Landing who joined the Night's Watch and became a companion to Arya Stark. He was killed by Polliver, a man-at-arms of House Lannister, while traveling north on the Kingsroad.
            Lommy is an orphan living in King's Landing. He was formerly apprenticed to a dyer before being arrested for thieving.
            Hot Pie and Lommy Greenhands bully Arya Stark when she joins their group. They demand she give up her sword, Needle. Hot Pie claims that he killed a boy once by kicking him to death, Lommy is quick to back him up. Arya refuses and threatens to kill Hot Pie. Both boys flee after being confronted by Gendry.[1]
            Lommy Greenhands is traveling north on the Kingsroad with Yorenâs recruits.[2] Gold Cloaks from King's Landing come upon them looking for Gendry. Yoren intimidates them into leaving but they promise to return with more men. Later, Lommy says that they should yield if the gold cloaks return, not wanting to be caught in a battle. Hot Pie claims that he is unafraid of battle and Arya questions his courage. Hot Pie claims to have seen lots of battles, Lommy refutes the assertion, as does Arya, and Hot Pie wonders what a dyer's apprentice would know about battle. As Gendry returns to refill the pail, Arya tells Hot Pie that Gendry is an armorer's apprentice. She instructs Hot Pie to relay his definition of a battle to Gendry. Hot Pie does so, and Gendry asks who told Hot Pie that. Hot Pie claims that he heard it from a knight. Gendry asks how Hot Pie knew he was a knight and Hot Pie again cites armor as deciding the issue. Gendry explains that anyone can buy armor. Hot Pie asks how Gendry knows and Gendry reminds him that he sold armor.[3]
            The group is sleeping in a barn when they are roused to arms by Yoren and told they are being attacked. Lommy grabs Gendry's bull's head helmet and runs outside. The group is attacked by Lannister guardsmen, and Lommy's leg is wounded by a bolt from a crossbow. He points out to Polliver that he cannot walk and someone must carry him; the Lannister man-at-arms offers his hand to Lommy and pulls him into the point of Needle, which he had taken from Arya Stark, driving the sword into the boy's throat. When Ser Amory Lorch demands the survivors point out Gendry, Arya tells him that Lommy was Gendry and the bull's head helmet lying next to his lifeless body is proof.[4]
            Arya meets Polliver again, about two years later. Keen to have revenge for what the Lannister soldier did to Lommy, she crippled him and while reciting the exact words Polliver said to Lommy before killing him, she stabbed him through the neck with Needle and Lommy was avenged.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lommy is a young recruit for the Night's Watch that Yoren meets in King's Landing. His forearms are dyed green from constant work. He does not appear until the second novel, A Clash of Kings. He survives the initial confrontation between the Night's Watch recruits and Ser Amory Lorch's men, escaping with Gendry, Arya and Hot Pie, though with his leg injured. He travels with them until they are captured by Ser Gregor Clegane's men. Lommy yields but is killed in the same way by Raff the Sweetling.
            Eventually Arya encounters Raff and avenges Lommy's death, but it happens much later than the scene where she kills Polliver in the show.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lommy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLommy</string></dict>
        <key>Lodos</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.221.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lodos is mentioned by the Archmaesters of the Citadel as they discuss a raven they receive from Bran Stark, warning the the Night King and his army are marching on Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. One of them compares his claim that he saw this through warging to Lodos' claim that about the Drowned God destroying Aegon the Conqueror.[1]
            InÂ The World of Ice and Fire, Lodos was a Drowned Man who claimed to be the living son of the Drowned God. He was crowned King of the Iron Islands by Nagga's bones at Old Wyk following the death of Harren the Black at the Burning of Harrenhal during the Targaryen Conquest.
            With the extinction of House Hoare, and all of the ironborn's strength on the mainland destroyed, they fell into infighting on their home islands. With no clear successor, five separate men on five different islands declared themselves king, among them Lodos, who was crowned by a gathering of forty other priests.
            When Aegon I Targaryen finally attacked the Iron Islands four years later, with a vast armada and his dragons, Lodos called upon the Drowned God to send krakens to drag Aegon's fleet into the depths of the sea. When no krakens appeared, Lodos filled his robes with stones and walked into the sea to "take council" with the Drowned God. Thousands followed him and their corpses washed up on the shores for years to come, though Lodos's body was never found.
            A man claiming to be Lodos reborn appeared on the Iron Islands during the reign of King Aenys Targaryen. He was executed by Lord Goren Greyjoy and his pickled head sent to the Red Keep.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lodos</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLodos</string></dict>

            Loboda is an elder of the Thenn, a fierce tribe of Free Folk.
            Loboda is a fierce and highly skilled warrior, and just like Styr he also fights wielding a huge axe. Loboda seems to show little sign of fear even when he is confronted by a White Walker, and without hesitation engages the Walker in single combat.
            When Lord Commander Jon Snow and Tormund arrive at Hardhome to offer the Free Folk to retreat to Castle Black and settle south of the Wall, a meeting of the clan chieftains is held, where Loboda represents the Thenns. Loboda doesn't believe the Night's Watch cares about what happens to them, despite the Lord Commander's appeals and his offer of dragonglass as a weapon against the White Walkers, which Loboda dismisses as just as unlikely as the mythical "ice spiders as big as hounds". Karsi replies that with everything they have seen none of this is unbelievable. Jon argues Mance Rayder would have supported his suggestion, so Loboda asks what happened to him. When Snow admits he killed him, Loboda prepares to kill him, only to be stopped by Tormund, who reveals it was a mercy kill. Karsi decides to side with the Lord Commander's plan as long as Tormund vouches for him, but Loboda remains stubborn, claiming that all the Free Folk who get on the Crows' boats will be executed, as they have always been enemies and his ancestors would spit on him if he broke bread with a crow. Loboda abandons the hall, and he is followed by many other chieftains, to the dismay of Jon, Tormund, and Karsi, who exclaims she "fucking hate[s] Thenns."
            While the wildlings who accept Jon's request to return with him are rowed to the boats, an avalanche engulfs thousands of wildlings on the other side of the settlement and a white fog consumes the area, so Loboda quickly orders the gates to be shut, leaving many of the Wildlings to their death by the White Walker army.
            Loboda defends the gate while killing several wights. However the massive army of the dead floods the position and breaches some parts of the palisades and scales the defenses. After seeing the White Walkers overseeing battle on one of the peaks. Loboda escorts Jon to retrieve the dragon glass inside the burningÂ hut, and when a White Walker appears, he tells Jon to find the dragon glass while he fights the Walker. After failing to strike down the White Walker twice, Loboda is quickly disarmed when his axe is shattered by the Walker's icy spear. The Walker then impales Loboda through the gut killing him instantly. He is likely among the dead resurrected by the Night's King just as Jon Snow, Eddison Tollett, Tormund, Wun Wun and a few other men manage to escape to the boats. Though it's possible his body was burned inside the flaming hut.[1]
            In theÂ A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no mention of a character named Loboda or ofÂ the presence of any Thenns at Hardhome. However, the show character plays a role similar to an unnamed, seasoned Thenn warrior mentioned in the prologue of A Dance with Dragons, who in the aftermath of Mance Rayder's defeat convinces a large group of Thenns to go back to their lands in the far north and are never heard of again. A secondÂ group of Thenns follow Styr's son Sigorn to the Wall and submit to the rule of KingÂ Stannis Baratheon. As the son of Styr, Sigorn is the new Magnar of Thenn.
            Loboda's threat to pluck Jon's eyes out is a nod to another Wildling chieftainÂ from the novels who likes to do this to his enemies and is only known among the Night's Watch by the nickname of "the Weeper" or "the Weeping Man", because he suffers from epiphora. The Weeper leads 300 warriors against the Shadow Tower in conjunction with Mance's attack on Castle Black, and while he is also defeated, he lives and manages to regroup his forces, remaining a constantÂ annoyanceÂ to the Night's Watch.
            Nothing from the TV episode or supplementary materials actually said that Loboda succeeded Styr as the new Magnar of the Thenns: he is apparently just a major chieftain/lieutenant of Styr.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Loboda</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLoboda</string></dict>
        <key>Locke</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.223.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Locke was a man-at-arms sworn to House Bolton, considered by Roose Bolton to be his best hunter.
            Locke, described by Roose Bolton as his "best hunter",[1]Â is dispatched to recapture Jaime Lannister. He and his men soon track the Kingslayer down, and take him into custody, along with his escort, Brienne of Tarth. Though Jaime attempts to bribe him, Locke refuses, fearing reprisals from Robb Stark.[2]
            En route to Harrenhal, Locke and his men attempt to rape Brienne but are persuaded otherwise by Jaime, who lies to Locke, convincing him that Brienne's home of Tarth - also known as the "Sapphire Isle"- is named such due to an abundance of precious gemstones, and that Selwyn Tarth would richly reward him for returning his only daughter alive and "unbesmirched". Emboldened by his success, Jaime attempts to barter for his release by reminding Locke of the wealth and power of his own father, Lord Tywin. This has an adverse effect, however, as Locke, angered by Jaime's arrogance and complacency, mockingly asks him to dine with his captors before throwing him over a tree stump and putting a knife to his eye. He tells Jaime that he believes himself to be the smartest man there is, but that he is nothing without his "daddy" and should not forget it. Locke ultimately leaves Jaime's eye alone, but gives his captive a permanent reminder by instead chopping off his sword hand.[3]
            Locke and his men continue taunting Jaime on the ride to Harrenhal, forcing him to wear his severed hand around his neck and offering him horse piss to drink. When the weakened Jaime steals a sword and tries to fight his captors, they disarm him and Locke kicks him onto the ground, threatening that if he pulls something like that again it will cost him the other hand.[4]
            Locke successfully delivers Jaime and Brienne to Roose Bolton at Harrenhal. Bolton is not amused to see that Jaime has been maimed and orders Locke to dispose of the severed hand. Locke proposes to send it to Tywin, which prompts Bolton to tell Locke that he will hold his tongue or lose it.[5]
            As Lord Bolton leaves to attend the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey at The Twins, Locke receives a raven from Lord SelwynÂ TarthÂ offering 300 golden dragons to ransom Brienne, butÂ Locke refuses, believing Jaime's lie about Tarth's wealth and thus considers Tarth to be shortchanging him. Locke also taunts Jaime as he sets to leave for King's LandingÂ with Qyburn and Steelshanks, saying that he'll "take good care" of Brienne, and puts her inside the Harrenhal bear pit for his amusement and that of his men, giving the warrior woman nothing but a wooden tourney sword to defend herself from the animal. To Locke's frustration, Jaime comes back to rescue Brienne with the help of Steelshanks, who has no choice if he wants to fulfill Lord Bolton's orders to bring Jaime alive to his destination.[6]
            Locke reunites with Roose Bolton and aids him with evading the ironborn forces in order to re-enter the North and deliver his new bride to the Dreadfort. He greets Roose's bastard son, Ramsay Snow,Â like an old friend, evidently having a strong bond with the boy over their shared sadism. After Ramsay reveals to his father that Bran and Rickon Stark are alive and speculates they might have sought shelter with their bastard half-brother Jon Snow at the Night's Watch, Roose promises Locke 1000 acres and a holdfast if he finds the two boys.[7]
            At CastleÂ Black, Locke infiltrates the Watch with the new recruits trained by Jon Snow and Grenn, proving himself skilled in combat. Pretending to befriend Jon, Locke poses as a game warden from the Stormlands who chose to take the black rather than losing his hand, the penalty for hunting a prized partridge to feed his children, and jokingly laments that he still has to suck up to "highborn cunts" like Alliser Thorne.Â Later, Thorne sends Locke to fetch Jon. Locke briefly eavesdrops on Jon and Samwell Tarly talking about Bran's whereabouts and pointing out Craster's Keep as the likeliest place, before revealing himself and telling Jon that Thorne wants to see him. Thorne sanctions Jon's expedition to capture or kill all theÂ mutineersÂ at Craster'sÂ Keep. After several brothers volunteer, Locke volunteers as well, hoping to find Bran and Rickon at the Keep. Jon points out that he cannot take a recruit, but Locke counters that Jon needs men who know how to fight and is willing to say his vows, which Thorne allows.[8]
            After the Night's Watch group led by Jon arrive at Craster's Keep, Locke is ordered to scout ahead. While scouting, Locke encounters the hut in which Bran, JojenÂ and Meera Reed, and Hodor are held prisoner. Locke returns to Jon and the others to give his report on the mutineers, but lies about the hut with the prisoners, claiming that it is a kennel and that they should stay far from it so the hounds don't alert the traitors. The raid takes place that night. Locke slays a few mutineers but then goes to Bran and the others and introduces himself as a member of the Night's Watch's rescue party, but soon exposes himself as a threat when he slices Bran in the leg. When Bran calls out to Jon, Locke covers his mouth and threatens to gut the others if he does that again. Locke then picks up Bran and attempts to escape the keep with him as he still needs to find Rickon as well. However, Bran wargs into Hodor, who ambushes Locke and kills him by snapping his neck with such force that his head is nearly torn from his body, unknowingly granting Jaime revenge for the loss of his hand.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Locke</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLocke</string></dict>
        <key>Glenmore </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.224.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Glenmore is the head of House Glenmore.
            Lord Glenmore commands a moderately sized army, and is described by Lady Elissa Forrester as being "no coward". His daughter, Elaena, had been betrothed to Rodrik Forrester before the War of the Five Kings broke out, the reason for the two not already being married. He is protected by the Glenmore Elite Guard, a force of twenty men, led by his son, Arthur Glenmore.
            After Elaena had received word that Rodrik survived the Red Wedding, she quickly set out for Ironrath. However, Lord Glenmore advised her to reconsider the betrothal in light of recent events. Depending on player choice, Rodrik can potentially offer half of the Forresters' ironwood to Lord Glenmore so that his worries may be assuaged.
            Elaena and her brother Arthur Glenmore visit Ironrath, on the grounds to help Rodrik take down Gryff Whitehill, because Lord Ludd Whitehill paid Lord Glenmore a visit at Rillwater Crossing and threatened him and his house with destruction along with the Forresters if he didn't accept a marriage between Gryff and Elaena. Lord Glenmore accepted the deal. He also believes his elite guard is on a ship bound for the Reach, when they are actually with Arthur and Elaena in Ironrath.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Glenmore_(Lord)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGlenmore</string></dict>
        <key>Jeor Mormont</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.225.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jeor Mormont was the father of exiled knight Ser Jorah Mormont and the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, choosing Jon Snow as his personal steward and grooming him for command while seeing him as a surrogate son. He led a great expedition ranging north of the Wall to investigate rumors of Free Folk amassing and White Walkers being sighted. He was killed at Craster's Keep by his own men after they rebelled against the Lord Commander for not standing up to Craster.
            Jeor Mormont, nicknamed The Old Bear, is the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, leading from his headquarters at the fortress of Castle Black. Jeor was once the Lord of Bear Island and head of House Mormont until he abdicated his seat in favor of his son, Ser Jorah Mormont, and joined the Night's Watch. He rapidly rose through the ranks to become Lord Commander.[1] His son Jorah disgraced himself by selling slaves and fled to the Free Cities, leaving Jeor's sister Maege to rule Bear Island.[2]
            Lord Commander Mormont watches the new trainees practicing and talks to Tyrion Lannister about their lack of resources. He and Maester Aemon later request that Tyrion bring word of their problems to the King and Queen and ask for their help.[3]
            Jeor conducts a ceremony to induct the new class of recruits into the Night's Watch, reminding them of the honor of their brotherhood. Jeor chooses Jon Snow, a bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark, as his personal steward. Jon thinks this an insult to his superior martial skills, but Samwell Tarly suggests that the Lord Commander made this choice to groom Jon for command.[4]
            Jeor is summoned when the bodies of Othor and Jafer Flowers are discovered north of the wall and returned to Castle Black. Sam notices that they haven't rotted, to which Jeor comments that even though Sam is a coward, he is not stupid. Later Jeor receives word via raven that Eddard has been declared a traitor and arrested. He calls for Jon and informs him of this the news, reminding him of his duty before attempting to reassure him of his sisters' safety. Later Jon attempts to stab Ser Alliser Thorne after he mocks his family for being traitors. Jeor witnesses this and confines Jon to quarters. That night Jeor enters his own quarters to find Jon fighting a Wight, Othor risen again. Jon stabs the Wight but it rises and pulls Jon's sword out of its abdomen. Jon throws Jeor's lantern on it, lighting it on fire.[5]
            Thanking Jon for his action, and growing to see Jon as a surrogate son, Mormont gives him a Valyrian steel sword, Longclaw, an heirloom of House Mormont. Jeor had previously given to his son and heir, Ser Jorah Mormont, but Jorah had left the sword behind when he went into exile leaving Westeros in disgrace.[6]
            Jon attempts to leave Castle Black and join his brother Robb's army after he learns of Eddard's execution, but is persuaded to stay by his friends. Jeor is aware of Jon's attempted desertion but refuses to punish him, saying it is more important that he came back. Jeor tells Jon that the true danger and threat to the Seven Kingdoms comes from the White Walkers and wights beyond the Wall, not the looming civil war, and asks for Jon's help. Mormont aims to lead the Night's Watch in force beyond the Wall, find the missing Benjen Stark and identify and eliminate the threat posed by the White Walkers. Jon joins Mormont's party as it leaves Castle Black.[7]
            In the far North the great ranging of the Night's Watch traverses the Haunted Forest. They have passed six abandoned wildling villages and have been travelling for months. They reach Craster's Keep, the home of Craster, an unsavory ally who marries his daughters and has no sons. Jeor questions Craster and learns that he has not seen missing First Ranger Benjen Stark in years. Craster tells him that the wildlings are assembling under King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder. After Jon provokes Craster, Jeor aggressively reprimands him outside and confirms that he is indeed grooming him for command: he tells Jon, "You want to lead one day? Well learn how to follow."[8]
            The Watch are forced to move on when Jon follows Craster into the woods and sees him leaving a son for the White Walkers. Craster catches him and beats him. Jeor reveals to Jon that he has always known that Craster sacrificed his sons to Wildling gods but ignored it because of his value as an ally.[9] The ranging next camps at the Fist of the First Men where they await Qhorin Halfhand and his party from The Shadow Tower. Qhorin arrives and reports sighting lookouts in the Skirling Pass. Given Mance's background as a deserter from the Watch,Â Qhorin predicts that the wildlings will be more organized. He suggests they accordingly shift to wildling tactics and use a small group of scouts to overcome the lookouts. Jon requests to be part of the mission and Jeor accepts with encouragement from Qhorin and a promise from Samwell Tarly that he will take on Jon's duties as a steward.[10]
            As wights and their masters descend on the Fist of the First Men, the Night's Watch are forced to try and pull back to the Wall to warn the remaining garrison of the impending attack. During the retreat Mormont saves Samwell Tarly from a wight, only to learn that he had failed to dispatch ravens requesting aid as ordered, leaving the Night's Watch to fend for itself. Mormont angrily berates Tarly for bungling his one and only task.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jeor_Mormont</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJeorMormont</string></dict>
        <key>Loras Tyrell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.226.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Loras Tyrell was a popular tourney knight and ranked as one of the most skilled knights in Westeros. After being incarcerated for months and confessing his guilt before the High Sparrow, he abdicated his titles and became known as Brother Loras. However, he died mere minutes later along with his father and sister when the Great Sept of Baelor was destroyed in a plot orchestrated by Cersei Lannister.
            Ser Loras Tyrell is the son of Lady Alerie Hightower and Lord Mace Tyrell, the Lord Paramount of the Reach and Warden of the South. The Reach is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Tyrell is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Loras was raised in privilege in the family seat and regional capital of Highgarden. Loras is the heir to Highgarden and the Tyrell lands and titles,[1] and this status, along with his skills and good looks, makes him possibly the most sought-after bachelor in all of Westeros.[2]
            Loras is a skilled knight famed for his many tournament victories and his good looks, which make him popular with the smallfolk and with young women in particular. Loras is one of the few knights who has on rare occasion managed to defeat the formidable Jaime Lannister in a joust.[3] He is commonly known as the "Knight of the Flowers", as a rose is the sigil of House Tyrell and he thus wears armor elaborately engraved with flowers.
            Loras is the former squire of Lord Renly Baratheon and remains Renly's lover. When the series begins Loras is in King's Landing primarily to compete in tourneys and attend court.[4]
            Ser Loras takes part in the Hand's tournament, riding against Ser Gregor Clegane. He charms the common people by giving a rose to Sansa Stark, but at the same time, he also exchanges a look with his lover, Renly Baratheon. Loras uses a mare who is in heat to upset and confuse Gregor's mount, as Gregor is known to favor unruly stallions, making it easier to unseat him. Gregor, furious, decapitates his own horse with a sword, and then attacks Loras. Gregor's brother, Sandor, intervenes and saves Loras's life. Even though there is supposed to be one more round with Loras jousting against the Hound to determine a tournament winner, Loras proclaims Sandor the champion, to the approval of the crowds. When Loras raises Sandor's arm declaring him the winner, Sandor looks somewhat lost, as he is not used to the adoration and approval of the public that Ser Loras takes for granted.[5]
            Loras shaves Renly's chest in his chamber. Renly comments about how much Loras's armor must have cost his father. They discuss the succession and Loras suggests that Renly should claim the Iron Throne himself should anything happen to King Robert. Renly points out that he is fourth in line to the throne, behind his nephews Joffrey and Tommen and his brother Stannis. Loras dismisses them, saying that Joffrey is a monster, Tommen is too young and Stannis has all the charisma of a lobster. Loras suggests that the common people would support Renly, who is more widely known and popular. Loras suggests that his family would support and finance Renly's claim. Renly remains dubious.[5]
            When Catelyn Stark arrives in King's Landing with news of the attempt on Bran's life by the man with a knife, Littlefinger identifies it as his own knife which he lost to Tyrion Lannister on a bet that Loras would defeat Jaime Lannister in a joust which is why Catelyn takes Tyrion prisoner. When confronted with this Tyrion denies it saying he always bets on Jaime to win so he would never have bet on Loras against him.
            After Robert Baratheon is wounded and is expected not to live, Renly approaches Eddard Stark offering men so they can seize Joffrey before Cersei can consolidate her power, but Eddard chooses not to act while Robert still lives. The next day, he learns that Renly and Loras have fled the city with their loyal retainers, and were last seen riding south.[6] Tywin Lannister learns that Renly has claimed the Iron Throne, as Loras had urged Renly to do.[7]
            Renly declares himself King of Westeros with the support of House Tyrell. He gathers an army of over 100,000 men from across the Reach and the Stormlands.[8] He solidifies his alliance by marrying Loras's sister Margaery Tyrell, the only daughter of Mace Tyrell. He camps his army near Storm's End and throws a tournament for his men. Renly and his new Queen watch from a wooden dais. Margaery stands and cheers Loras as he disarms his opponent. His rival manages to step under a swing of his great axe and knock him off his feet. Loras yields when his opponent lifts his visor and holds a knife close to his face.
            Renly congratulates the combatants as they stand and calls the winner forward. He commands them to stand and remove their helm. The crowd are shocked when the fighter is revealed to be a woman; Brienne of Tarth. Renly tells her that she is everything that her father promised. Margaery says that Loras fought valiantly and Renly agrees with her. He names Brienne champion and offers to grant anything that she requests. Brienne asks to join his Kingsguard, and he accepts.[9] Loras is not happy about her appointment to the Kingsguard.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Loras_Tyrell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLorasTyrell</string></dict>

The two exchange greetings, in which Lord Blackmont reveals Prince Oberyn has arrived the previous night, before he and the rest of the envoy proceed to the Red Keep.[1]

            Lyonel participated in the Conquest of Dorne and was declared Steward of Dorne by King Daeron I Targaryen, the Young Dragon. He was murdered, however, when he pulled down a sash by his bed to summon his consort and a hundred red scorpions fell on him. His death ignited a revolt that led to the death of King Daeron and the end of the Iron Throne occupation.[1][2]
            Lady Olenna Tyrell mentions Lyonel, though not by name, as the last Tyrell to have visited Dorne. She was musing on whether her meeting with Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes at the Water Gardens would go any better, which it apparently did.[3]
            About Lyonel
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lyonel Tyrell was an infant during the Dance of the Dragons, with his mother ruling the Reach as Regent. She chose to remain neutral during the civil war, thus the Reach was divided between the supporters of Aegon II and those of Rhaenyra.
            Decades later, Lyonel commanded the army that invaded Dorne via Prince's Pass. After the Young Dragon's initial victory, Daeron appointed Lyonel as governor of Dorne. The Dornishmen however proved cunning and impossible to rule, particularly under a Reachman - the Reach and Dorne having been bitter enemies for centuries. Thus, Lord Lyonel moved with his train from one keep to the next, chasing rebels out and keeping the knees of the Dornishmen bent. It was his custom to turn the lords of the keeps he stayed in out of their chambers and sleep in their place. One night at Sandstone, seat of House Qorgyle, finding himself in a bed with a heavy velvet canopy, he pulled a sash near the pillows to summon a wench. When he did so, the canopy opened and a hundred red scorpions fell upon him. His death sparked new revolts, and in a fortnight all the work of the Young Dragon was undone, eventually bringing the about the death of King Daeron himself.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lyonel_Tyrell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLyonelTyrell</string></dict>

He was also the father of Jacaerys, Lucerys and Joffrey Velaryon.
            
            SerÂ Laenor VelaryonÂ was aÂ knightÂ fromÂ House VelaryonÂ and was the first husband of PrincessÂ Rhaenyra Targaryen. He was aÂ dragonriderÂ whose dragon wasÂ Seasmoke.
            Laenor was the son of LordÂ Corlys VelaryonÂ and PrincessÂ Rhaenys Targaryen.Â He was one year younger than his sister,Â Laena. During theÂ Great Council of 101 AC, some lords spoke for Laenor.
            Laenor wasÂ knightedÂ a fortnight before his wedding with PrincessÂ Rhaenyra TargaryenÂ inÂ 114 AC. His groom and likely lover, SerÂ Joffrey Lonmouth, was mortally wounded by SerÂ Criston ColeÂ during the wedding's tourney. Laenor refused to leave Joffrey's side during his passing. Laenor returned toÂ High TideÂ while Rhaenyra remained at court inÂ King's Landing. Laenor eventually found a new favorite, the household knight SerÂ Qarl Correy.
            Ser Laenor and Princess Rhaenyra had three sons, PrincesÂ Jacaerys,Â Lucerys, andÂ Joffrey Velaryon, the last named after Joffrey Lonmouth. It was noted none of the children resembled either Laenor or their mother in appearance, causing many to suspect that the children's real father was SerÂ Harwin Strong.
            Laenor was slain by his friend Qarl over a quarrel inÂ SpicetownÂ inÂ 120 AC. KingÂ Viserys I TargaryenÂ brought his court and dragons to Driftmark for the funeral.Â None of Laenor's sons survived the later civil war, theÂ Dance of the Dragons.

        <key>Lewyn Martell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.231.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Prince Lewyn Martell was a knight in the Kingsguard of King Aerys II Targaryen, who became known as "the Mad King".[1]
            Prince Lewyn Martell was the uncle of Prince Doran, Princess Elia, and Prince Oberyn Martell, and a great-uncle of Princess Rhaenys and Prince Aegon, Elia's children by her husband, Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone. He was also somehow related to Rhaegar himself as well as his siblings, Viserys and Daenerys, and his other son by Lyanna Stark, Jon Snow, as their ancestor Queen Myriah was a Martell by birth, and Lewyn's ancestor, also named Daenerys, was a Targaryen by birth.[2]
            A younger son, he joined the elite Kingsguard, forswearing any claim to land and title.
            During Robert's Rebellion, at the climactic Battle of the Trident, Prince Lewyn accompanied his fellow Kingsguard Ser Barristan Selmy as they both followed Rhaegar to face the rebel army led by Robert Baratheon. Prince Lewyn perished in the battle, along with thousands of other Dornishmen.[3]
            Prince Rhaegar also died in the battle, brought down by Robert's warhammer after an epic duel. Ser Barristan, Lewyn's fellow Kingsguard, was very badly wounded but due to the quick actions of Robert's maester ultimately survived.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lewyn Martell is remembered fondly by his family as a kind man who loved his extended family. The Kingsguard are forbidden to marry or even to love, and in the past several have been severely punished even for having sexual affairs. As per the customs of Dorne, however, Prince Lewyn continued to secretly keep a paramour. Ser Barristan and the other Kingsguard were aware of it but kept his secret, as he did not let it interfere with his duty.
            Lewyn joined the Kingsguard in part because he was the younger sibling in his generation of House Martell. He was actually the eldest son, but rule passed to his older sister (mother of Doran, Elia, and Oberyn) due to Dorne's gender-blind inheritance laws, different from the rest of the Seven Kingdoms.
            At the Battle of the Trident, Prince Lewyn led the large Dornish contingent (10,000 men strong) which threatened to break Robert Baratheon's left flank. During the fighting he became badly wounded, however, and in the confusion Ser Lyn Corbray led a counter-charge by the rebels, in which he personally dueled and killed Lewyn Martell. The vain and arrogant Ser Lyn would in later years boast about how he had personally defeated Prince Lewyn, though in reality Prince Lewyn was already very badly wounded (perhaps mortally so) and Corbray simply finished him off.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lewyn_Martell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLewynMartell</string></dict>
        <key>Lancel Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.232.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Lancel Lannister was the eldest son of Kevan Lannister and a nephew of Tywin Lannister. He served as a squire for King Robert Baratheon until he was elevated to knighthood, but after sustaining heavy injuries during the Battle of the Blackwater, he joined the religious movement known as the Sparrows and abandoned his family name, after which he was simply known as Brother Lancel.
            Lancel Lannister is the son of Ser Kevan Lannister and the nephew of Lord Tywin Lannister, the head of House Lannister and Lord of Casterly Rock. He is the first cousin of Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion Lannister. He has the familial blond hair and resembles his cousin Jaime. He is a squire to King Robert Baratheon.[1]
            King Robert has Lancel pour wine for him whileÂ discussing old battles with Ser Barristan Selmy. Robert mocks Lancel's alliterative name, asking if his father had a stutter. Robert becomes annoyed when Lancel runs out of wine and sends him for more.[2] At the Hand's tourney, Lancel tries in vain to help Robert into his armor, tactfully suggesting that it was "made too small". Robert angrily replies that Lancel's mother was a "dumb whore with a fat arse". At this point Eddard enters the tent and bluntly tells Robert, "You're too fat for your armor", to the king's amusement. When Lancel also laughs, Robert sends him out in search for the "breastplate stretcher" (a snipe hunt for a nonexistent device). Eddard seems to feel sorry for Lancel, while Robert hopes that he is sent all over camp looking for this thing. Eddard says he should stop torturing Lancel.[3]
            Lancel accompanies Robert, Renly and Ser Barristan on a hunt, frequently giving Robert wine.[4] He is present when Robert is mortally wounded by a wild boar. Varys insinuates that Lancel's readiness with the wine may have been deliberate in order to slow Robert's reactions.[5]
            While Jaime is being held captive in the Riverlands by Robb Stark, Lancel enters into a sexual relationship with his cousin Cersei. The Queen receives news of the war. Lancel questions her about it, as he finds it exciting and wants to know what she will do. Cersei becomes irritated and tells him to stop talking and get back into bed.[6]
            Lancel attends court in the Iron Throne room following the defeat of Stafford Lannister in the Battle of Oxcross. King Joffrey Baratheon aims an ornate crossbow at Sansa Stark and says that she is there to answer for Robb Starkâs treasons. She denies having any involvement in Robbâs actions, calling Robb a traitor. Joffrey instructs Lancel to tell her of Robbâs latest outrage. Lancel claims that Robb used sorcery and an army of wolves to kill thousands of men under the command of Stafford. He adds that the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain after the slaughter drawing cries of outrage and horror from the courtiers. Joffrey orders Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard to beat Sansa but spare her face. Tyrion arrives and halts the torture of Sansa.[7]
            Tyrion has had Grand Maester Pycelle arrested for breaking his confidence and feeding information to Queen Regent Cersei Lannister.[8] Cersei sends Lancel to Tyrion with a warrant for the release of Pycelle. He arrives late at night and Tyrion invites him for a drink and Lancel refuses. Tyrion wonders why Cersei did not come herself. Lancel says that he does not care and Tyrion continues to question him. Tyrion establishes that the order came directly from Cersei and then asks why Lancel waited to deliver it. Lancel says that he came immediately and Tyrion wonders what he was doing conferring with Cersei so late at night. Lancel improvises and says that Cersei often works through the night, and Tyrion retorts that she must be glad to have Lancel helping her at all hours. Tyrion notes the scent of lavender oil on his cousin and says that it is a favorite of Cersei. Lancel asserts his position as a knight, and Tyrion jokes that he is an anointed knight. Tyrion asks if Cersei had Lancel knighted before or after she took him into her bed. Lancel furiously calls that a lie, but when Tyrion threatens to tell Joffrey, he collapses into a chair, aghast. Lancel claims that it wasn't his fault, and Tyrion asks if she took him against his will. Lancel insists he was following Tywinâs orders to obey Cersei in all things, but Tyrion counters by asking him if Tywin ordered him to sleep with her as well. Tyrion points out the benefits Lancel has received and threatens to go straight to Joffrey at which Lancel falls to his knees and begs him for mercy and offers to leave the city. Tyrion says that Lancel must act as his spy to buy his silence. Tyrion asks Lancel to beg Cerseiâs forgiveness and agrees to release Pycelle but refuses to reinstate him to the council.[7]
            Bronn stands guard as Tyrion meets with Lancel in a litter on the streets of Kingâs Landing. Lancel reveals that the Queenâs plans for defense of the city hinge on the use of Wildfire. Tyrion is disbelieving and threatens to reveal Lancelâs sexual relationship with Cersei to Jaime Lannister. Lancel offers more information to back his claim; Cersei has met with the Alchemists' Guild and they have already stored thousands of pots of the substance. He says that they are planning to launch it from the walls onto Stannisâs fleet and army. Tyrion sees that Lancel is telling the truth and asks when Cersei told him. Lancel says that he has heard Cersei talking with a pyromancer and has visited their guild. Tyrion forces Lancel to swear that his words are true but tires of toying with his cousin and dismisses him. Tyrion kicks him over as he ducks out of the litter and then instructs him to tell Bronn to kill him if anything happens to Tyrion. Lancel dutifully does as he is told. Bronn says that it would be his pleasure as Lancel jogs away. Tyrion uses the information to usurp Cersei's connection to the Alchemists' Guild.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lancel_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLancelLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Lyonel Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.233.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Lyonel Baratheon was a knight and member of House Baratheon.
            Lyonel Baratheon was a member of House Baratheon of Storm's End, one of the Great Houses of Westeros, and rulers of the Stormlands. He took part in the Trial by Seven of Ser Duncan the Tall.
            He has an entry in the The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, as read by Eddard Stark.[1]
            Lyonel Baratheon appears in The Hedge Knight, one of the stories in the Tales of Dunk and Egg series, which focuses on Ser Duncan the Tall and Aegon V Targaryen during Aegon's time as Ser Duncan's squire. Ser Lyonel is known as "the Laughing Storm". He would often break into booming laughter the moment tourney rivals touched his shield, and laugh all the time he was mounting and charging and knocking them from their stirrups. If his challengers wore any sort of crest on their helm, Ser Lyonel would strike it off and fling it into the crowd.
            The entry for Lyonel in the Lineages book from Season 1 (see this image) says that he died at the age of 45, but this is unlikely, and possibly a case of the TV writers just filling in the gaps of knowledge for the prop book - in which case it is not strictly TV-canon. In the novels, he apparently died between 239 AL and 245 AL, and when he took part in Duncan's trial by seven in 209 AL he was already a large and powerful warrior. Assuming that Lyonel was at the very least 16 years old in 209 AL (like Duncan was, though he was probably older), he would have been born around 193 AL. Lyonel therefore could have been at most around 52 years old when he died - but from how he is presented in The Hedge Knight, he was apparently somewhat older than Duncan. More information may be filled in with future Tales of Dunk &amp; Egg novellas.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lyonel_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLyonelBaratheon</string></dict>
        <key>Lymond Hightower</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.234.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lymond Hightower was a King of the Hightower during the Age of Heroes.
            When the kings of House Gardener conquered the Reach, Lymond decided to marry into their family rather than fight them. By marrying a daughter of House Gardener, Lymond was able to transform the Hightowers from wealthy but relatively minor kings into the greatest lords of the Reach. Since then, House Gardener, and later on House Tyrell, has always defended Oldtown, allowing the Hightowers to focus on learning on trade.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lymond is not mentioned. The World of Ice and Fire specifies that Lymond was known as the Sea Lion and fought and killed King Theon III Greyjoy after ceasing to pay tribute to the Ironborn king. He brought back the First Men tradition of thralldom long enough to make the captured ironborn work on strengthening the walls of Oldtown.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lymond_Hightower</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLymondHightower</string></dict>
        <key>Lann</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.235.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lann, known as Lann the Clever, was a legendary trickster of the Age of Heroes. House Lannister boasts descent from him through the female line.
            According to legend, Lann the Clever swindled Casterly Rock from its previous rulers, House Casterly, using nothing but his wits.[1][2][3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lann the Clever is the founder of House Lannister and a popular character among singers and storytellers. One of the stories narrates how he stole gold from the sun to brighten his hair.
            There are many different and contradictory myths about Lann the Clever, assuming he actually existed, which only share the basic description that he swindled Casterly Rock from House Casterly "using only his wits" - though there are even rival tales about what specifically winning it "by his wits" involved. Some stories say that he found a secret tunnel into Casterly Rock, and snuck around inside causing intrigue between the Casterlys, stealing treasures from one brother's chamber and planting them in another's to cause strife, until ultimately the Casterlys killed each other and Lann took over, and possibly finished off any survivors. Other tales say that he used the secret tunnel to infest the castle with rats and vermin, until the Casterlys fled - while yet other tales say that he managed to sneak lions into the castle, who killed several Casterlys and caused the rest to flee. The more pragmatic story is that Lann was simply a man-at-arms in the castle, who impregnated Lord Casterly's daughter, and ended up marrying the girl. Because there were no other heirs left, when Lord Casterly died Lann became the new Lord of the Rock through his child. This story also has several variants, as in some there simply was no other heir, while in others Lann had married a low-ranking daughter and had to "use his wits" in various palace intrigues to increase his power and eliminate rival heirs who were further ahead in the line of succession.
            Even Lann's origins are not clear in the legends. Some say that he was actually an Andal adventurer who came to the far west, though others dismiss this because the main Andal invasion didn't occur until thousands of years later. Then again, it is not outright impossible that he was simply an Andal adventurer (or perhaps exile) who wandered all the way to the far side of Westeros. Even so, most versions of the story do assume that he was simply one of the First Men, the only human settlers of Westeros at the time. Whatever the case, the rulers of Casterly Rock eventually married into invading Andal families and the "modern" House Lannister came to be.
            On one other point the tales all agree: Lann never called himself a "king". The Casterlys were very rich but they had not called themselves "kings" either, and Lann didn't crown himself when he took over Casterly Rock. The Lannisters only started calling themselves "kings" many generations later, after their steadily accumulating wealth made them very powerful (though still long before the Andal invasion).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lann</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLann</string></dict>
        <key>Ludd Whitehill</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.236.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Ludd Whitehill is the Lord of Highpoint and head of House Whitehill.
            Ludd has known Roose Bolton, his liege lord for a long time. He has five children by his late wife,Â Lady Whitehill: Karl, Ebbert, Torrhen, Gwyn, and Gryff. Karl died fromÂ Greyscale, Ebbert is studying at the Citadel, Torrhen serves Roose Bolton, Gwyn stays with him at Highpoint, and Gryff is at Harrenhal.
            Ludd Whitehill and the men under his command aided their Bolton overlords in carrying out the Red Wedding - massacring men from other Northern houses during the slaughter - particularly those from House Forrester, their bitter rivals.
            Following Roose Bolton's ascension as Warden of the North, Ludd continued to serve faithfully by aiding Roose's bastard son, Ramsay Snow, in assuring the loyalty of the Forresters.
            Lord Whitehill is first seen walking into the Forrester Great Hall, offering his condolences to Ethan Forrester regarding Gregor's death, and Rodrik's supposed demise. He then tells him that he was disappointed that he was not the one to kill them. Ethan can choose to remain calm, or be a little defensive. Ludd Whitehill will complain about how there is no bread and salt being given to the guests. Ludd will get angry that he is not getting any justice for his men whom Gared "murdered". Ethan can tell him that he did it out of self-defense and that he was protecting his family, which does not matter to Ludd. The Whitehills then leave.
            Later that week, Ethan either meets Ramsay and Ludd in the Great Hall, or by the gate. Either way, they end up meeting in the Great Hall regardless. Ramsay orders Lord Ethan to bend the knee to the Warden of the North, RooseÂ Bolton. He can choose to kneel or refuse. Ramsay states he does not care about his loyalty and says that he will be taking their Ironwood. Ethan ends up proving a point and Ramsay settles for half of the Ironwood. He then tells Ethan that he will set up a garrison of twenty men in the walls of House Forrester. Lady Elissa refuses and then Ramsay snaps his finger and pronounces it already done. The men come inside the great hall as Ramsay asks Ludd who will lead the garrison. Ludd says that his son,Â Gryff, will lead the garrison, as he trusts him more than anyone else. Ramsay looks over to Ethan's younger brother, Ryon, who is hiding behind his mother.
            Ramsay taunts Ryon to rile Ethan, who can step forward, ordering them to leave him be. Ramsay will then look at Ethan's sister, Talia. He grabs her and says that she's coming with him as his ward. Ethan can offer himself, grab her or just tell him to let her go once again. Ramsay lets Talia go and steps closer to Ethan, telling him he is bold (or brave/wise) before thrusting a dagger into the Lord's throat in a split second. As the Forresters reel in shock, Ramsay explains that he does not want a bold lord. He then gives Ryon to the Whitehills to make sure the Forresters do not try anything.
            Ludd is given Ryon as his captive in case the Forresters try to fight back against the Whitehill Garrison inside their walls, he stated that the Forresters brought this on themselves before he left the great hall.
            Ludd bursts into Ironrath after receiving a raven from Elissa Forrester about letting Ryon attend the Funeral of Gregor and Ethan he will only let him attend if Rodrik kisses his ring to show him respect if he does Ryon attends the Funeral however if he does not he will be kept at Highpoint and his daughter Gwyn will attend the funeral instead, Ludd also announces that he is taking the other half of the Ironwood forrest before mockingly calling Rodrik "Rodrik the Ruined".
            Ludd does not appear in this episode however when Rodrik Forrester and Gwyn Whitehill meet on mutual land she reveals that Ludd is just waiting for a reason to attack and that Rodrik has a traitor on his council.
            Ludd sends a raven to Rodrik inviting him to Highpoint to discuss a truce. At Highpoint, however Ludd will judge Rodrik on whether or not he brought the Glenmore soldiers to protect him. Rodrik, Elissa, Gwyn, and Royland/Duncan come to the table of House Whitehill and when Ludd finds out Rodrik had imprisoned his son Gryff he will bring Ryon into the room only to hold Ryon hostage, however he is convinced to make the trade of Gryff for Ryon which he agrees but they will make the trade on neutral soil he then tells Rodrik to "get the fuck out of my halls".
            It is revealed by the traitor Royland/Duncan that Ludd planned on ambushing and killing Rodrik when they made the trade, however Gryff and the Whitehill garrison are freed by the traitor, meaning House Forrester has lost their only hostages. Ludd then commands Gryff and his men to ambush and kill Asher Forrester and his hired pit fighters when they make land on Westeros, thanks to Lord Whitehill's orders, either Asher or Rodrik are killed during this ambush.
            Ludd appears at Ironrath's front gates with the Whitehill army.
            
            If Asher survived:
            Ludd will try to persuade Asher to bend the knee as a bannerman to House Whitehill and to marry Gwyn to unite their houses. Asher can decide whether to insult Lord Whitehill, or to discuss House Forrester's fate with his family and advisors. A plan is then created, to assassinate Lord Whitehill. Asher can choose whether to ambush Ludd in their House, or whether to poison his drink, after tricking Lord Whitehill into believing he has won, setting the stage for the White Engagement. If poisoned, Ludd is killed at the cost of Lady Forrester's life. If ambushed, or if Asher unsuccessfully tried to make peace with the Whitehills after speaking with Gwyn, Ludd narrowly escapes the massacre in the great hall that claims the life of his son Gryff. Ludd rallies the Whitehill army and successfully seizes Ironrath in the ensuing battle.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ludd_Whitehill</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLuddWhitehill</string></dict>
        <key>Kurleket</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.237.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kurleket is a man-at-arms sworn to House Bracken. He helps Catelyn Stark to apprehend Tyrion Lannister and dies defending her during her passage through the Vale of Arryn.
            Kurleket is a loyal Man-at-Arms of House Bracken, a vassal house of House Tully. He is traveling the Kingsroad following the Tourney of the Hand.
            Kurleket is drinking with companions at the Inn at the Crossroads when Tyrion Lannister arrives on his way south. Catelyn Stark is also in the inn and Tyrion recognizes her. She turns to the knights from the Riverlands in the inn to help her to take Tyrion into custody, accusing him of attempting to murder her son Bran Stark. She asserts her origin as a daughter of House Tully and then tells the man of House Bracken that she recognizes the red stallion of House Bracken and says that her father Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun considers Lord Jonos Bracken one of his most loyal bannermen. Catelyn announces that she will return Tyrion to Winterfell to await the King's justice. The Knight of House Bracken draws his sword and threatens Tyrion.[1]
            He accompanies Catelyn east into the Vale of Arryn; her claims to be headed to Winterfell were a diversion. Among the party are the captive Tyrion, the two Lannister men-at-arms who were traveling with Tyrion, Catelyn and her escort Ser Rodrik Cassel, the sellsword Bronn, the singer Marillion, a knight of House Whent and six other swordsmen loyal to House Tully. The party are attacked by warriors from the hill tribes. Kurleket dies defending Catelyn. Catelyn, Tyrion, Rodrik, Bronn, Marillion, Chiggen, Ser Willis Wode, Morrec and Lharys survive the attack and continue to the Eyrie.[2]
            In A Song of Ice and Fire, three men-at-arms from House Bracken accompany Catelyn into the Vale. Kurleket is the leader of the trio and he is the one who speaks to Catelyn in the Inn at the Crossroads. He assists in the capture of Tyrion Lannister and is among the party that travels into the Mountains of the Moon. He was slain during a battle with the Mountain clans.
            Kurleket's name is an inside joke by author George R.R. Martin. All three men from House Bracken whom Catelyn recruits at the Crossroads Inn are named "Mohor", "Lharys", and "Kurleket" - as in Moe, Larry, and Curly, the infamous Three Stooges. Martin has himself confirmed the reference.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Kurleket</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascKurleket</string></dict>
        <key>Croft</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.238.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"One-Eyed" Croft is a high-ranking member of the Second Sons.
            Croft is originally from Westeros but came to Essos for unknown reasons. He also lost his left eye.
            He apparently was involved in a job with Asher Forrester, and afterwards the two didn't part on the best of terms.
            After the Second Sons were pledged to Daenerys Targaryen, Croft went with them to Meereen following the Battle of Yunkai. Croft leads the Hellhounds in the Second Sons.
            Needing to hire an army of sellswords in order to fight back against House Whitehill, Asher suggests Croft, reasoning that Croft owes him a favor. Beskha responds that Croft probably hates Asher after their last job, but Asher promises to bring Croft to their side.[1]
            Asher, Beskha, and Malcolm Branfield reach Daenerys' camp. Malcolm or Beskha, depending on who you saved earlier in the episode, set off to find Croft. Malcolm asks how well Asher knows Croft, to which both Asher and Beskha respond 'too well'. Malcolm states he thought they were friends. Asher answers this, saying they are, in fact, 'Great friends.'
            Croft finally appears in his tent, punching Asher's face and knocking to the ground. He curses and insults Asher, noting that Asher had some balls walking into his tent with his grin after all those years. He rants on how Asher never understood consequences, and how Asher stole from his, expecting to be forgiven. He gestures and his men grab the trio. The men push Asher against a wooden tent support, and give Croft a knife. Croft then asks how Asher is going to pay him back, and names Asher's eye, hand, and tongue. Beskha tries to diffuse the situation, citing on how she deserves his anger as much as Asher, but Croft quiets her, and states that she's next.
            Croft turns his attention back to Asher, ordering him to choose, or he'll cut off Asher's balls. Whatever, Asher chooses, Croft names Asher's choice, before stabbing the wooden pole behind him and laughing hysterically. His men let go of their hold on the trio. Asher and Beskha join in, with Beskha noting that is why people steal Croft's stuff and take off in the night. He orders Jodan, to fetch the Khaleesi's best wine. Malcolm comments that Croft has an interesting sense of humor. Croft then asks why Asher and Beskha are in Meereen, a long way from Yunkai. They reveal that they need Croft's Hellhounds, a hundred good men to fight in Westeros. He refuses, stating that he has good in Essos, and citing that the Second Sons are sworn to Daenerys Targaryen, and how he's laid his sword at her feet.
            Malcolm asks that they could speak to Daenerys, but Croft responds that she's commanding a siege, her enemies are nailing up slave children, and her dragon went missing. Asher chuckles, asserting that he knows how to find the dragon. Croft shrugs this off, and is only convinced to grant Asher a meeting with Daenerys when he either shows him a dragon tooth or Malcolm's or Beskha's burns. He remarks that if Asher is lying, it'll cost him a lot more than whatever Asher chose earlier in the episode.
            Later, Croft emerges from Daenerys's tent, and allows Asher to enter.[2]
            Croft enters Daenerys's tent while Asher speaks with her. Asher is denied Croft's contingent of Second Sons by Daenerys. Daenerys orders Croft to see Asher's group leave, and his men move to do so. When Asher's services are offered to help the Seconds Sons in their raid on Meereen, Croft, surprised at Daenerys's interest in this, asks if she is really considering it.
            After agreeing to the terms, Daenerys states that Asher and Beskha will join Croft's men, and that he will see settled in. Croft guides them to his tent. He reminds them that they can get their armor patched up and get extra bedrolls there, as well as the piss bucket being in corner where it's always been. Beskha enters the tent, while Asher comments on how long it's been since they had a piss bucket. Croft puts his arm around Asher tent, stating that it took him two years to get where he is, and Asher better not fuck it up for him. He leaves, calling to Nail, informing him they have two more for the mission.
            Asher walks through the camp, to find Croft and Beskha arguing. Croft orders Beskha to stop drinking, before they go on their mission. Croft tries reason with her to listen by stating that the kind of fool who does that wants to die out there. He and Beskha get in each other's faces and the argument escalates, as Asher observes. Beskha is angered that Croft thinks she's too drunk to fight, and as he questions what she should do, she punches his stomach. Asher can encourage Croft, Beskha, try to break it up, or stay silent. Croft turns to Asher to let him deal with her, believing she will get them killed. As he begins to exit, Beskha states that Croft sounds scared, before he turns back and warns if Beskha can't hold it together, they'll leave both of them. He storms out of the tent. Later in their altercation, Beskha mentions that she doesn't care what Croft has to say.
            Later, in Daenerys's tent, he joins the other Second Sons in planning the meeting. As Asher enters, he moves the chips representing the Unsullied and Second Sons on various parts of Meereen. Once the Queen asks if they shall begin, Croft takes command, explains the importance of their target, four guard posts used to warn the masters if the slaves wish to revolt, which they plan to take out so they don't see the uprising coming. He assigns Therrond to the north, Penn to the south, Asher, Beskha, and himself to the east, and Kieran the west. As Beskha enters to speak to Asher, Croft warns the others to not get cocky because one mistake can cost them, and to get do what they have to do, and take their people out unharmed. Before Asher and Beskha can leave, Daenerys reminds them to follow Croft's orders exactly or they will get nothing.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Croft</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCroft</string></dict>
        <key>Xaro Xhoan Daxos</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.239.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Xaro Xhoan Daxos was a powerful merchant established in the great city-state of Qarth.
            Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a powerful merchant prince of the great city of Qarth born on the Summer Islands, located far to the south of the Dothraki sea, beyond the Red Waste. He is a member of the Thirteen, an organization that rules over Qarth.
            He boasts of being the wealthiest man in Qarth.[1] In Qarth, a merchant invited into the Thirteen remains in his seat for as long as he is feared or respected enough not to be denied membership by his other twelve peers, unlike the Pureborn, who hold hereditary seats.[2]
            Xaro Xhoan Daxos has heard rumors concerning the return of magic into the world. Among them are glass candles burning, ghost grass growing far away from the Shadow Lands and a Dothraki khalasar led by a woman with three heads, presumably Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons.[3]
            Xaro and the Thirteen meet Khaleesi Daenerys Targaryen at the gates of Qarth, weeks after the Thirteen met with Daenerys's bloodrider Kovarro. They demand to see her dragons and when she refuses they deny her admission to the city. Xaro invokes the ancient custom of Sumai to allow her and her people to be admitted under his protection.[4] Xaro welcomes Daenerys to the city and makes her a guest in his expansive mansion. He makes repeated references to the fact that he came to Qarth with nothing, but by skill and determination has made himself the richest man in the city.[5]
            Xaro hosts a lavish reception for Daenerys in his gardens to introduce her around to Qarth's social elites, and showers her with gifts. Later that night, he shows her his massive treasure vault which is impossible to open without the key he always wears around his neck. Inside is his enormous fortune which he promises to divide with her if she will marry him. Xaro informs Daenerys that news has reached Qarth that King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the subsequent outbreak of the War of the Five Kings which is tearing Westeros apart. Daenerys learns that the major noble Houses which played an active role in deposing House Targaryen are now fighting each other: Robb Stark is fighting the Lannisters, and the Baratheons have been split between Robert's two younger brothers, Stannis and Renly.[6]
            Daenerys is at first excited by this news, as she has lived in fear of Robert Baratheon her entire life. More importantly, the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings means that House Targaryen's enemies are now divided. She seriously considers Xaro's offer of a marriage-alliance, as he can provide her with enough money to raise an army to invade Westeros with. Her advisor Ser Jorah Mormont is more hesitant, however, stressing that men like Xaro only want something in return. Daenerys acknowledges that Xaro has openly admitted that he hopes to become even wealthier if Daenerys reconquers Westeros as his wife, but Jorah points out that this won't simply be rewarding Xaro: the lords of the Seven Kingdoms will say that it was Xaro's conquest, achieved with resources he provided, and Daenerys will become little more than a figurehead.[6]
            Initially eager to take the quickest path back to Westeros, Daenerys eventually relents to Jorah's advice and decides to decline Xaro's offer for the moment. Instead she tries to secure support for her return to Westeros from his colleagues in the Thirteen, but without success. While they are meeting with the Spice King her dragons are stolen from Xaro's home.[7] One of Daenerys's maids Irri is dead while the other, Doreah, is missing and presumed dead. Xaro uses the theft as a premise to hold a council of the Thirteen in his home. He then stages a coup with the assistance of the warlock Pyat Pree and declares himself King of Qarth. The warlock uses his magic to kill the rest of the Thirteen. They reveal that they stole the dragons and have taken them to the House of the Undying. Daenerys flees in terror.[8]
            Daenerys later escapes from the House of the Undying after retrieving her dragons and with her men invades Xaro's house where she finds Xaro in bed with Doreah, revealing that she had in fact betrayed Daenerys and her dragons to Xaro and Pyat Pree. Xaro and Doreah plead for their lives, with Xaro promising to get her ships to invade Westeros. Using the circular key pendant, the treasure vault is opened and found to be empty, his enormous wealth a lie to cling on to his power and seat. Xaro and Doreah are locked inside the merchant prince's vault to die, andÂ Daenerys and her people ransack Xaro's house of all its gold and precious items, which Ser Jorah says will be enough to buy a small ship.[9]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a member of the merchant guild known as The Thirteen, one of several groups vying for power in Qarth. He has impressive influence and power, and owns eighty-four ships, including his own pleasure barge which he often takes sailing on the Jade Sea.
            In the books the Qartheen, and Xaro himself, are described as pale-skinned, while the actor Nonso Anozie is black, the series giving the explanation that he is a foreigner from the Summer Islands who has been accepted into Qartheen society. In the novels, he is described as having pale skin and a long, beaklike nose crusted with jewels: rubies, opals and flakes of jade. The series also departs from the novels in having him vouch for Daenerys at the gates of Qarth; in A Clash of Kings, Daxos was one of three Qartheen representatives (with Pyat Pree and Quaithe) who returned to her with Jhogo and invited her to Qarth.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Xaro_Xhoan_Daxos</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascXaroXhoanDaxos</string></dict>

            Qhorwyn's son Harwyn was considered unruly and worthless, and was sent away. After Qhorwyn died, he succeeded him as King of the Iron Islands after being elected in the Kingsmoot.[1]
            Qhorwyn was a shrewd king who avoided war and instead gathered wealth during his reign. He tripled the size of the Hoare fleets and ordered the creation of additional weaponry to dissuade enemies from attacking. Qhorwyn's eldest son died ofÂ greyscaleÂ and his middle son, PrinceÂ Harlan, died after falling from a horse while Qhorwyn was lying ill. After Qhorwyn's death, his third son and successorÂ Harwyn HardhandÂ conquered theÂ riverlandsÂ using his father's strengthened military.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Qhorwyn_Hoare</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascQhorwynHoare</string></dict>

            Qhored was a ruthless ruler and his law was dominant at sea. He sacked Oldtown and defeated the River King, Bernarr II Justman. He then took his three youngest sons as hostages. When their Bernarr's tribute was late, Qhored killed all three sons by ripping their hearts out with his own hands. Bernarr then attacked, but Qhored was successful once again. Qhored then drowned Bernarr in service to the Drowned God.[1]
            During the reign of King Qhored, theÂ ironbornÂ could rightfully claim that his writ ran "wherever men can smell salt water or hear the crash of waves." The ironborn were at their peak of expansion, ruling territory along theÂ Sunset SeaÂ from theÂ ArborÂ toÂ Bear Island.Â Many men abandoned the shores for fear of Qhored's reavers, while those who remained were forced to pay tribute.Â TheÂ Kingdom of the ReachÂ called him Qhored the Cruel. King Qhored died at the age of 90, having ruled for 75 years. Qhored's conquests were gradually lost by his successors and descendants, however.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Qhored_Hoare</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascQhoredHoare</string></dict>
        <key>Qhorin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.242.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Qhorin was a member of the Night's Watch, a senior and experienced ranger regarded as an elite scout and soldier. He was known as Qhorin Halfhand or simply The Halfhand.
            Qhorin is considered to be one of the best and most experienced rangers within the Night's Watch. He is called half-hand because he lost most of his fingers on his right hand in a fight with a wildling. His injury has forced him to train with his left hand, resulting in his becoming as proficient with his left as he ever was with his right. He was once a good friend to Mance Rayder before Mance turned traitor against the Night's Watch.
            Qhorin is based at The Shadow Tower along the Wall but spends a significant portion of his time ranging beyond the Wall. He was stranded beyond the Skirling Pass during the last winter before the series begins. He survived alone in the wild for an entire winter, returning to the Wall once the snow thawed.[1]
            Qhorin leads a force of men north from the Shadow Tower to meet Lord Commander Jeor Mormont on his great ranging to search for First Ranger Benjen Stark and investigate the origin of the Wights that attacked Castle Black. They rendezvous at the Fist of the First Men and discuss the wildlings organizing under King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder. Qhorin sights wildling lookouts in the Skirling Pass and suggests using scouting parties to displace them. He offers to lead one personally. Jeor's steward Jon Snow asks to join Qhorin, but Jeor argues against it stating he is not a ranger. Jon defends himself saying no one else present has killed a wight, but Jeor counters that he also let Craster beat him up, at which point Qhorin defends Jon. Sam offers to take on Jon's duties, and Jeor agrees to let Jon go.[1]
            Qhorin's party finds a group of lookouts and ambushes them. Jon hesitates in killing one, realizing the wildling, Ygritte, is a woman. Qhorin questions her and then leaves Jon alone to execute her.[2] Jon does not return and Qhorin goes looking for him. He finds Jon's tracks but is ambushed by wildlings while following them. Qhorin's men are killed and he is taken prisoner by the wildlings. He is soon joined in captivity by Jon. He urges Jon to ensure that the deaths of his men were not meaningless and says that he could be a valuable spy in the wildling ranks. He then feigns anger with Jon to make him seem more sympathetic to Ygritte, and to make him look like a traitor to the Watch.[3]
            Later on, Qhorin realizes that he will have to sacrifice himself in order to facilitate the ruse of Jon deserting to the wildlings, so he stuns one of his captors and acquires a sword, attacking Jon with the seeming intention of killing him for treachery. The Lord of Bones lets them fight, and Ygritte gives Jon back his sword. Qhorin enrages Jon by insulting his parentage. After a fierce duel, Jon mortally stabs Qhorin per Qhorin's own instructions, who whispers to Jon "We are the watchers on the Wall" before he breathed his last, signaling to Jon that he has done the right thing and reminding him where his loyalties lie. As planned, by killing Qhorin, the wildlings believe Jon has betrayed his oath and release him. On Rattleshirt's advice, Qhorin's body is burned to ensure he will not return as a wight.[4]
            When Jon is put on trial before a panel of black brothers for his time with the wildlings, Ser Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt accuse Jon of murdering Qhorin and initially refuse to believe that Qhorin would sacrifice himself so easily, despite Thorne having considered Qhorin like his own brother. Maester Aemon, however, believes Jon's claims and he is spared.[5]
            When Jon Snow and Sansa Stark are reunited, Jon laments having killed men he admires, among them likely Qhorin.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Qhorin Halfhand is regarded as an extremely capable scout, based at the Shadow Tower, the western-most manned castle of the Wall. He is held in high esteem by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont.
            He has a clean shaven face and is tall. It is never explicitly stated he wears a hat. He is very calm and collected. Qhorin specifically lost three fingers on his right hand, all except his index finger and thumb (thus he is still able to more or less functionally use his hand). In the TV series, of course, the actor is wearing heavy gloves due to the cold, and this obscures that he actually has these fingers, but they do refer to him in dialogue as "Halfhand". His personality differs quite a bit from the books in the TV series in that while he is still a rather calm person, he is shown to be more gruff and shows a disdain for southerners. Unlike his counterpart in the books, he sports a moutache and a goatee.
            Qhorin's story is significantly different than in the TV series: first, his reason for sending the scout parties was to find out what was the secret power that Mance Rayder was looking for in the Frostfangs.
            Second, Qhorin never ordered Jon to kill Ygritte: he told him "you must do what needs be done". After Jon let Ygritte go and returned to the others, Qhorin explained Jon it was not bad choice to spare her life. If he wanted to kill her, he'd do it himself, or order Ebben to do that. He left Ygritte's fate for Jon to decide in order to know him better.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Qhorin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascQhorin</string></dict>

            During theÂ Battle of Castle Black, Cooper takes part in defending the Wall against Mance Rayder's forces. When Castle Black's inner gate is threatened by the giant Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg, he accompanies Grenn, Donnel Hill, and other three black brothers to defend it. Although he initially wavers and considers fleeing upon seeing the giant, he is convinced by Grenn to stay and fulfill his oath to the Night's Watch. They successfully kill the giant, but all of the black brothers are slain in the process. Their bodies are discovered by Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly after the battle.[1]
            After the arrival ofÂ Stannis Baratheon and his forces, though not seen Cooper is among the numerous bodies of fallen black brothers burned in Castle Black's courtyard.[2]

        <key>Craster</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.244.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Craster was a member of the Free Folk and an unsavory ally of the Night's Watch.
            Craster is a wildling who lives north of the Wall. He lives in a fortified homestead, rather grandly called Craster's Keep, along with his daughters and wives. When his daughters grow old enough he marries them, and then incestuously fathers new children with them. At the time of the War of the Five Kings, he has nineteen wives. He is counted as an ally of the Night's Watch and allows his keep to be used as a redoubt by the Watch on their rangings northwards. However, he is also regarded as an unsavory character and his relationship with his daughters is regarded as sordid. The Night's Watch grudgingly has to tolerate this, as he is one of their few sources of information and shelter beyond the Wall.
            A Great Ranging of the Night's Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont arrives at Craster's Keep. Questioned by Mormont about Benjen Stark, Craster answers he has not seen Stark for three years and has not missed him because of his attitude. The wildling asks for wine and comments that southerners make good wine. Jon Snow takes offense and retorts that they are not southerners.[1]
            Craster turns his attention on Jon, compares him to his daughters and demands his name. He notes his bastard surname and reminds that anyone from south of the Wall is a southerner and that they are in the real north now. Jeor intervenes to apologize on Jon's behalf. Craster warns Jon against talking to his daughters. Jeor agrees to follow Crasterâs rules while they are his guests and orders Jon to sit down and keep quiet. Craster asks if they brought wine and Jeor says that they did before questioning him about the abandoned villages they have passed. Craster insists on wine before answering and Jeor sends a man to fetch a cask of Dornish wine from their supplies. Jon looks around at Crasterâs numerous daughter-wives on the upper level of the hall.
            Craster reveals that the other wildlings have all gone to join Mance Rayder, calling him Jeor's old friend. The Lord Commander takes offense and decries Mance for breaking his vows to the Watch. Craster notes that Mance has gone from being a simple brother to the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Jeor observes that Mance has claimed that title for years but wonders what he rules. Craster holds up a finger and comments on the axe one of the officers is holding. Jeor orders the man to hand over the weapon, promising that it will be replaced on their return to Castle Black. Craster tests the weapon by cutting into the wood at his feet. He then reveals that Mance has been gathering an army and plans to march south. Jeor warns that it is a bad time to live alone in the wild and that âThe cold winds are rising.â[1]
            Craster is unimpressed and says that his roots are sunk deep. He pulls over his daughter-wife Gilly and instructs her to tell Jeor how content they are, calling him the Lord Crow. Gilly says that they are protected by Craster and that it is better to live free than die a slave. Craster asks if Jeor is jealous of his many wives. Jeor says that they chose different paths and Craster jokes that Jeorâs path has only boys on it. Craster stands and asks if they would like to stay and Jeor accepts the offer. Craster warns that he will take the hand of any man who touches his wives and threatens to gouge Jonâs eyes out if he so much as looks at them.[1]
            Craster carries one of his babies into the woods at night. He leaves the baby on the ground and turns back towards his keep. Craster goes back to where he left the baby and finds Jon watching a White Walker pick up the baby from the ground. Before Jon can pursue the creature, Craster knocks Jon out with a blow to the head.[2]
            Craster brings Jon back to the keep with his wrists bound and face bloodied. Craster follows his captive inside and rouses the men of the Night's Watch. He tells them to get out blaming Jon for meddling and kicking his captive. Jeor and his men rise from their beds and Craster's wives watch from the rafters, Gilly among them. Craster approaches the Lord Commander and hands him Longclaw, telling him that he wants his men to leave and insisting that they make things right. Jon starts to speak, but the Lord Commander sends him outside, where Jon tells him what Craster is doing to his sons, but to his shock, Jeor has known for a long time and done nothing to stop it. Jeor explains that while he too is horrified at Craster's actions, he is essential to the Night's Watch for the information and shelter he provides for them North of the Wall. Jeor gives him Longclaw, instructing him not to lose it again, and they leave at dawn.[3]
            The survivors of the Battle of the Fist of the First Men return to Craster's Keep on their way back to the Wall. He initially mocks them and wants to refuse them shelter until he notices some of them stroking their weapons. Fearful that in desperation they might try to rush him, he relents. As the black brothers warm by his hearth, Craster continues to mock them, admits that he's feeding his pigs better than them - as pigs are useful to him - and half-seriously suggests to his guests that they should eat Samwell. He is also annoyed by Gilly's loud wailing from birthing pains. Craster insists that the black brothers should be grateful for his generosity, and that he is such a "godly man" for doing so. Mormont tensely questions that he is a godly man, but Craster insists that he is - to the "real gods", who consume entire armies on their way to the Wall but will spare Craster for his loyalty.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Craster</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCraster</string></dict>
        <key>Cressen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.245.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cressen is the Maester of Dragonstone and a servant of Stannis Baratheon. He dies trying to trick Melisandre into sharing a poisoned cup of wine with him.
            Cressen is a maester of the Citadel, a man of learning assigned to a castle to advise its inhabitants in matters of science and medicine. Cressen has served Lord Stannis Baratheon at Dragonstone for many years.[1]
            Cressen is worried about the influence that the red priestess Melisandre has over Stannis, and is horrified when she gets him to renounce the Faith of the Seven. When she has the carved wooden statues of the Seven burned on the beach, he speaks out against doing this. He says that all of them were named in the light of the Seven, and they risk the wrath of the Gods. Cressen tries to talk to Davos about going against her, but Davos refuses, saying that right now is not an opportune time to act. The maester decides that if Stannis can't be talked into putting Melisandre aside she must be killed, before she leads him into a war he cannot win.
            Later Cressen sits at the Painted Table, at a council meeting with Stannis, Davos, and Melisandre. When he puts poison in a cup of wine, Davos silently urges him to stop, but he does not. Walking around the table, Maester Cressen says that they should put their differences aside and asks Melisandre to drink a toast with him. He drinks from the cup first and hands it to her. She watches him and sees his nose start to bleed. She knows it's poison, but with a smile she drinks the rest of the wine anyway. As he dies almost immediately, she stands over him, unaffected by the poison. As she watches him die her red ruby necklace begins to glow.[2]
            When Shireen Baratheon is teaching Gilly how to read, she mentions to her and Samwell Tarly that Cressen taught her how to read when she was three years old.[3]
            When Samwell tells Archmaester Ebrose that Shireen Baratheon was cured of her greyscale to try and persuade the Archmaester to allow him to try and help Jorah Mormont, Ebrose responds that Cressen accomplished this when Shireen was very young and the disease had not spread so much.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cressen is a long-standing servant of House Baratheon. He was maester at Storm's End for many years, and advised Stannis during the year-long siege of the castle by the armies of House Tyrell during Robert's Rebellion. After the death of Lord Steffon Baratheon in a shipwreck, Cressen had adopted a fatherly attitude to the three Baratheon boys, particularly to Stannis, who lacked the charm of Robert and Renly. After Stannis was made Lord of Dragonstone, Cressen followed him to his new home, something uncommon among maesters, who are assigned to keeps and castles and not to lords, and has continued to advise him there ever since. Approaching eighty years of age, Cressen has started to slow down, so Stannis asked the Citadel to send him an assistant, Pylos, to take up his burdens and eventually replace him, a prospect Cressen is not happy about.
            While normally stoic and unsentimental, after his death Stannis later says that Cressen was like a second father to him after his own father Steffon died. Stannis did ask for Pylos to replace Cressen, though not because he simply wanted to dispose of the man, but because he was actually concerned about his well-being. As Stannis curtly explained to Cressen, his duties as a maester would require him to climb the steep stairs of the castle to the rookery every day, but with his failing health and bad hip, it was only a matter of time before he fell down the stairs and died, and Stannis would not have Cressen needlessly kill himself in his service.
            Melisandre never openly mocks Cressen at any point in the novels. It is Stannis's wife Selyse and their daughter's motley-tattooed fool Patchface who ridicule him for being old, and while Melisandre knew about the poisoned cup, she actually seems to take pity on the maester, and even tells him not to throw his life away by going through with the plan. His death also occurs slightly differently. First, Melisandre drinks and appears completely unaffected, but Cressen then drinks and dies from the poison. This also occured before the burning of the idols and not after.
            Shireen Baratheon mentions in Season 5's "The House of Black and White" that Cressen taught her to read. In the novels, Cressen was Shireen's teacher and had a kindly attitude towards her, pitying her frail health and how Greyscale had marred her face. Cressen and Shireen actually did have a scene together in the book: when Cressen received the special white messenger-raven from the Citadel announcing that autumn had begun, Shireen asked to see it and he obliged: he could never deny a request from her, feeling that life had already denied her so much. The scene between Cressen and Shireen didn't take place in the TV version, however, because Cressen is introduced and then dies in the Season 2 premiere - and the TV producers weren't even sure during Season 2 if Shireen would ever appear in the TV series, though they later decided to introduce her in Season 3.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cressen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCressen</string></dict>
        <key>Criston Cole</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.246.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Criston Cole was a knight and a Lord Commander of the Kingsguard of both Viserys I Targaryen and Aegon II Targaryen.
            During the great Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, about 170 years before the War of the Five Kings, Ser Criston Cole was the Lord Commander of old King Viserys I, and had sworn to support the succession of his eldest child to the throne, his daughter Rhaenyra Targaryen. However, as soon as Viserys I died, Cole sided with Viserys I's younger son Aegon II Targaryen in a coup to seize the throne, during which Cole personally crowned Aegon II. When Master of Coin Lyman Beesbury refused to go along with the other conspirators on the Small Council, Ser Criston slit open his throat at the council table itself. Eventually Ser Criston died in the war, after being betrayed by the Riverlords that helped him to hold the stronghold of Harrenhal.[1]
            Ser Criston Cole was the most controversial Kingsguard member in history - at least, before Jaime Lannister personally killed his own king. While reading through The Book of Brothers, Jaime himself reflects that some Kingsguard were the best of men, and some were the worst, though most were simply men of average morality and above-average skill with a sword. When he comes upon Ser Criston Cole's entry, however, he notes that he was a bit of both, a hero and villain in equal parts.
            Criston Cole personally crowned Aegon II at the start of the Dance of the Dragons, usurping his older sister Rhaenyra, and forever afterwards Cole became known as "the Kingmaker".
            Cole was one of the best warriors of his generation, and one of the few men ever to beat the famed Daemon Targaryen in combat (Viserys I's younger brother). He became a member of the Kingsguard early in Viserys I's reign, and became the constant companion and favorite of young Princess Rhaenyra. In time, many suspected that Cole had a passionate love affair with Rhaenyra, though it remained unconsummated. Here the rival propaganda spread by both sides in the war clouds history: Aegon II's supporters say that Cole begged her to elope with him to the Free Cities, never to return, but that she spurned a life as a sellsword's wife. More lurid anti-Rhaenyra tales alleged that it was actually Rhaenyra who tried to seduce Cole sexually, but he refused due to his vows. Whatever the case, over the years they had a falling out and Cole went from being her beloved to her bitterest enemy, driving him to join Aegon II's faction at court. Cole even personally tutored Aegon II's younger brother Aemond to be a great swordsman himself. Years later, Rhaenyra remarried to her uncle Daemon (as per Targaryen incest customs).
            There is uncertainty about Cole's exact motives. Some think that he was an ambitious man and realized that Aegon II was a pliable fool while Rhaenyra was a strong and willful ruler; indeed, Aegon II did later name him his Hand of the King. Others think that his reasons for siding with Aegon II were not political but entirely personal, due to his now firm hatred of Rhaenyra and Daemon. Whatever the case, Cole drew the first blood of the entire civil war, when he personally killed Master of Coin Lyman Beesbury. While sitting at the Small Council table itself after Viserys I died, Beesbury soon realized that all of the other council members wanted to usurp Rhaenyra by putting Aegon II onto the throne. When he firmly refused to go along with it, Cole snuck up behind him and without saying a word slashed Beesbury's throat, causing him to bleed out onto the council table. Cole personally set the crown of Aegon the Conqueror on Aegon II's head at his coronation.
            Yet it was to be no easy coup, as nearly half of the realm sided with Rhaenyra. Even the Kingsguard itself was split, as three other members fled to join Rhaenyra's Queensgard - they took Viserys I's crown with them, which was in response used in Rhaenyra's own coronation to symbolize that she was truly her father's rightful heir.
            After becoming frustrated with his grandfather Otto Hightower, Aegon II dismissed him and appointed Ser Criston as the new Hand of the King. Cole commanded Aegon II's armies in a successful campaign through the Crownlands that took Duskendale, and in the major Battle of Rook's Rest (which involved three dragons). Aegon II was badly injured in the battle and his brother Aemond became regent while he recovered.
            Aemond was a great warrior and dragonrider, but also a hothead with no strategic skill. Rhaenyra's loyalists were massing at Harrenhal, so Aemond decided to lead out all of his local forces along with Ser Criston to attack it - leaving King's Landing itself with only a skeleton defense. This was all a ploy by Daemon, and after drawing out Aemond and Criston his armies withdrew from Harrenhal to attack the Lannisters to the west, while Rhaenyra's smaller forces from Dragonstone to the east (augmented by dragons) were able to take King's Landing almost bloodlessly. Flying into a rage at now-empty Harrehal, Aemond left on Vhagar to fight a one-dragon war against Rhaenyra's supporters in the Riverlands, abandoning Cole and his remaining army, who began a difficult march back to the Reach through enemy territory, without any dragon to support them. They were soon surrounded by a combined Stark-Tully army, which despite outnumbering Cole's forces by around three to one had not dared to attack before when the great dragon was present - but now it was gone. The resulting battle, known as the Butcher's Ball, was incredibly lopsided and Cole's army was destroyed. During the battle, Cole challenged the Stark and Tully commanders to settle the fight by single combat. Given that Cole was one of the top warriors in all of Westeros, each of them realized that if they played his way they'd lose, so they didn't bother: instead they declined his challenge and killed him with volleys of arrows from a distance. The death of Cole and the destruction of his army, with King's Landing now under Rhaenyra's control, marked the height of the queen's fortunes in the war.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Criston_Cole</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCristonCole</string></dict>
        <key>Bloodsong</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.247.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bloodsong is a recently freed pit fighter in Meereen. Judging by his appearance and accent, he is likely from easternÂ Essos, possibly Yi Ti.
            Not much is known about Bloodsong other than he is a arrogant and skillful pit fighter. He took great pleasure from killing other pit fighters.
            When Asher Forrester came to the fighting pit looking for fighters to aid his family, the leader of a group a now freed pit fighter, Amaya, asks Asher to fight Bloodsong to prove his worth. When Asher eventually wins, he is given the choice to either finish Bloodsong off or spare him. Killing him impresses the pit fighters, who cheer Asher's name. Sparing him gives you the choice to kick him or help him up. If the player kicks him, the pit fighters seem a little more accepting of Asher's act of mercy. If the player helps him up, he accepts the gesture with a surprised expression on his face but the pit fighters are unimpressed.
            If spared, Bloodsong accompanies Asher to Westeros, saying that he will seek a more honorable death there. When the Whitehill ambush is sprung in the port town, Bloodsong is trapped outside of the gate along with most of the fighters. He escapes with either Asher or Rodrik while the other Forrester brother stays behind.
            Bloodsong is first seen walking with the other pit fighters, complaining about Westeros and how hungry he is. Upon arrival in Ironrath, he and the other pit fighters become dissatisfied with events and begin turning against Rodrik. The player can choose how to try and get the fighters back on their side but before anything else can happen a Whitehill soldier arrives informing them that the Whitehill army will be there soon meaning the fighters and the Forresters will have to work together.
            Bloodsong later accompanies Rodrik to Ludd Whitehill's camp. Rodrik, or in the first case Beskha, order Bloodsong and the other fighters to attack the Whitehills, free the restless horses, or burn down the guard tower in order to create a diversion. After Rodrik has taken care of Ludd/Gryff, Rodrik, Bloodsong and the other fighters return to Ironrath.
            He then fights alongside his fellow pit fighters during the Battle of Ironrath and kills numerous soldiers, even directly helping Rodrik at one point, suggesting that he has come to respect the Lord of Ironrath. He watches in horror as the gates are smashed down and the army attacks; soon most of the pit fighters, Forrester soldiers and smallfolk are killed while Amaya is shot dead and Bloodsong is presumably killed along with the rest of its inhabitants. However his fate is unknown and he may have survived.
            Bloodsong is first seen riding towards a farmhouse on horseback and informing Asher and the other fighters that some of the Whitehills that attacked them at the harbour are approaching. He then helps defeat these fighters and returns with Asher to Ironrath.
            Later, when the Forrester household are discussing how they are going to kill Ludd Whitehill, he seems to favour the Sentinel's idea of ambushing the Whitehills, scoffing at Beskha's suggestion that they give Ludd poisoned wine and calling poison 'a woman's weapon'. It is up to the player which method to use.
            He is present in the Great Hall when the Whitehills arrive, and helps kill Whitehill soldiers when a fight breaks out.
            Bloodsong fights alongside his fellow pit fighters during the Battle of Ironrath and kills numerous soldiers, even directly helping Asher at one point.

        <key>Blood </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.248.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>After Lucerys Velaryon was killed by Aemond Targaryen, Lucerys's stepfather Daemon Targaryen hired two assassinates to kill Aegon's and Helaena's children, Blood and Cheese. Blood was a former Goldcloak and Cheese was a rat-catcher who knew all the sewers around King's Landing. This meant that they both had perfect recognition of the layout of the Red Keep. After breaking into the royal apartments, they found Helaena putting her children to bed. They demanded a son for a son. Helaena pleaded they kill her instead, but they refused. She named her younger son Maelor as the victim. However, Cheese just told Maelor that his mother wanted him dead, and some believe that Helaena named Maelor because Jaehaerys was heir to the Iron Throne, or because Maelor was just too young to understand. This request became an act of defiance against the Greens, as Blood just beheaded Jaehaerys with a single blow. By the time the guards had came, the Queen was cradling her son's body. Jaehaerys's death would eventually led to his mother's insanity and suicide.[1]
            Blood was an serjeant in theÂ City Watch. He lost his gold cloak for beating aÂ whoreÂ to death whilst in a drunken rage. He spent time inÂ Flea Bottom. After the death of PrinceÂ Lucerys Velaryon, Blood, along withÂ CheeseÂ was employed byÂ Mysaria, PrinceÂ Daemon Targaryen's spymaster, to slay one ofÂ Aegon II Targaryen' sons.
            Once Blood and Cheese confronted QueenÂ Helaena TargaryenÂ in theÂ Tower of the HandÂ they told her to name which son she wanted them to kill. Helaena offered herself but they refused, stating it had to be a son. Although Helaena eventually named her youngest sonÂ MaelorÂ (after Cheese threatened that Blood would rape her daughterÂ JaehaeraÂ if she did not choose one now), they killedÂ JaehaerysÂ instead. It was Blood who slew Jaehaerys, striking the boy's head off with a single blow. After killing Jaehaerys, Blood and Cheese did no further harm to Helaena or her surviving children and fled with the prince's head in hand.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Blood_(goldcloak)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBlood</string></dict>
        <key>Lord of Bones</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.249.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The Lord of Bones, also known as Rattleshirt[1], was a notorious leader among the Free Folk and a fearsome raider.
            The Lord of Bones is an infamous wildling raider. He is known for wearing a giant's skull instead of a helmet and armor made of bones, which he wears to intimidate his enemies. His real name is unknown.
            Ygritte takes Jon Snow to the rest of the warparty and introduces him, to the Lord of Bones, as "a present". The wildling commander is dismissive of Ygritte's arguments to keep him alive, as he already has Qhorin Halfhand as prisoner. He relents, however, after Ygritte's insistence and the reminder that Mance Rayder would want to decide for himself whether the bastard son of Eddard Stark lives or dies. However, he threatens Ygritte to castrate Jon should he try to escape. As the warband and their prisoners march to Mance Rayder's camp in Skirling Pass, Qhorin attacks Jon, blaming him for the deaths of Stonesnake, Borba and Harker. The Lord of Bones warns Qhorin not to strike his captive again.[2]
            When Halfhand attacks Jon once again, as part of his plan to have Jon infiltrate Mance Rayder's host, the Lord of Bones orders his men to let the two fight. After Jon kills Qhorin, the Lord of Bones cuts the ropes binding his hands together and orders his men to burn the Halfhand's corpse. He turns to Jon and taunts him that he would not want Qhorin's corpse coming back for him.[3]
            The Lord of Bones successfully brings Jon to the King-Beyond-the-Wall's camp and to Mance Rayder's tent. Removing his helmet, he is commended by Mance and thenÂ asked to leave with his group, including Ygritte, so that ManceÂ may speak to Jon in private to which he obliges.[4]
            Jon Snow and Tormund visit Hardhome to rally the wildling forces to fight the undead army. The Lord of Bones meets with Tormund, and speaks about the events which led Jon and Tormund to work together. The Lord of Bones accuses Tormund of being a traitor and makes an insulting remark about Tormund sucking Jon's cock. Before he can finish the insult, Tormund grabs his staff and beats him to death with it in front of the other wildlings.
            If his corpse was not burned while the parlay was taking place, it is likely that in the aftermath of the massacre at Hardhome, the Lord of Bones was reanimated as a wight by the Night King alongside all the other dead Wildlings and brothers of the Night's Watch.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Lord of Bones is one of a number of formerly fiercely independent wildling warrior leaders who has been recruited by Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, to join his forces. He is a fierce enemy of the Night's Watch. Though he refers to himself as the Lord of Bones, the Night's Watch dubbed him "Rattleshirt" as a mockery of the rattle sound produced by his armor. His true name is unknown.
            It is not Tormund but the Lord of Bones who is captured by the Watch during the Battle of Castle Black. Tormund never goes to Hardhome and thus never kills him there, as he did in the TV show. Instead, Melisandre has him burned alive, but switches his appearance with that of Mance Rayder to make it look as if Mance is the one being burned, and Mance masquerades as the Lord of Bones for a while before revealing himself.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lord_of_Bones</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLordofBones</string></dict>
        <key>Cotter</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.250.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cotter is a member of the Free Folk recently recruited to the Night's Watch, encountered by Gared Tuttle. He abandons the Night's Watch in search of the North Grove.
            Cotter grew up in a village near Hardhome. When his sister Sylvi was born, she had white hair and was considered a bad omen. After her second nameday, Their mother left Sylvi wrapped in furs in the forest to die, but Cotter came to her aid and they left the village.
            Cotter and his fellow Free Folk were searching for weapons south of the Wall, Cotter got caught, however he successfully managed to pretend he was one of the smallfolk and was sent to the Wall. He claims he stole potatoes for his sister as the reason why he was sent to the Wall.
            It's implied since arriving at the Wall, Cotter has had to spend a deal of time with Finn, already exhibiting frustration at Finn's habit of "bragging about all the girl's he's fucked".
            When Gared Tuttle arrives at the Wall, he soon meets his brothers-in-training, Finn and Cotter, the three of them being trained by Frostfinger. Finn and Cotter both reveal why they were sent to the Wall and argue during Frostfinger's speech. During training, Cotter accidentally shoots himself in the toe with an arrow from his crossbow when he fails to reload it. Finn laughs at this and to get back at him, Cotter pick-pockets Finn's dagger.
            When Finn realizes the dagger is missing he blames and attacks Cotter, Gared is caught in the middle and ends up fighting Finn. Frostfinger is angry and explains the last thief he caught had his fingers chopped off. A man searches Cotter but finds nothing, as Gared leaves with Jon Snow, Cotter reveals he still has the dagger - hidden up his sleeve.[1]
            At the wall, Frostfinger assigns the new recruits positions in the Watch. If Gared defended Cotter, the latter will be pleased with him while Finn will be annoyed. Frostfinger tells the recruits that Finn and Gared are to be Rangers, while Cotter becomes a Builder. He tells the northerners to follow his lead to a weirwood tree beyond the Wall to take their vows.
            On the way to the tree, Jon is glad to see that Gared will become a ranger, but suggests he make up with whichever brother he scorned during the debacle with Finn's knife - if he snitched on Cotter, he will have to make up with him. If Gared befriends his peer, Jon will say he handled it well, then watches as the three of them take their vows.
            Gared reunites with his Uncle Duncan. Once the visit is over, Finn and Cotter question him about their conversation, but Gared is secretive. The three of them celebrate becoming men of the Watch, entering the elevator to head for the top of the Wall.
            Gared later walks over to Cotter and Finn and talks about going to Craster's. Cotter reveals that he took the North Grove map from him, while Finn walks off because of his disbelief of the North Grove, dismissing the grove as a children's story, but Cotter invites Gared into a quieter space and tells him he can help him find the Grove - Finn doesn't know how to sneak past giants or deal with Mammoths, but Cotter does because he is from the lands above the Wall; he is a Wildling who was caught stealing weapons below the Wall and passed himself off as a local. He begs Gared to keep his secret and in return he'll help him desert the Watch to find the North Grove.[2]
            Cotter helps Gared escape his cell early in the episode, and leads him out of Castle Black, hanging back while Gared makes more daring maneuvers. The two encounter Finn if Gared made friends with him in the previous episode, Gared gets the choice to bring Finn along or refuse to. They then desert the Night's Watch.
            A while after, Gared and Cotter (also Finn depending on your choices) run into a few Wildlings. Cotter gets stabbed in the shoulder with a spear, Gared can choose to stay hidden or help Cotter. Gared and Finn (if he's there) fight off the Wildlings, and one gets away. One takes off with the food and Gared can kill her. Gared picks Cotter up and they keep on moving.
            They arrive at a hut and Cotter asks Gared to look around for water to drink. If Gared took the herbal poultice and bandages from Maester Ortengryn in "Iron From Ice", he can use them to treat Cotter's wound. Gared searches a hut and a wildling named Sylvi points her spear at him, threatening to gut him like a fish. Cotter shows up and reveals that Sylvi is his sister, and that she can lead them to the North Grove.[3]
            Cotter is first seen with his wound getting worse. Sylvi tells her brother that they must go south to join Mance Rayder. She refuses to go to the North Grove and Cotter says that he's come a long way. Gared can try to convince Cotter to convince Sylvi, but it doesn't work and Cotter says that maybe Sylvi is right. He is later seen yelling for help as the Wights attack. If Finn is there then Cotter and Gared run over to him and find that he has been killed during the fight. Cotter is sad to see him dead and Gared says they make for the North Grove. The three all agree and run away.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cotter</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCotter</string></dict>
        <key>Red King</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.251.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Red King was a title held by the head of House Bolton of the Dreadfort during The Age of Heroes.[1]
            Before the North was unified under the rule of House Stark, House Bolton ruled in their own right over vast stretches of lands east of Winterfell and styled themselves as the "Red Kings of the Dreadfort". During this time the Boltons were the greatest rival of the Starks, and waged war against them for centuries.[1]
            After many centuries, the Starks finally forced the Boltons into submission when Rogar Bolton - last of the independent Red Kings - bent the knee to the Starks and recognized their rule as King in the North.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, it is believed that the Starks and Boltons have been fighting each other since right after The Long Night itself and the construction of The Wall, about 8,000 years ago according to legend.
            Historians say that the last of the Red Kings, Rogar Bolton, bent the knee to House Stark just as the first ships of the Andal Invasion were beginning to land in eastern Westeros - which started about 6,000 years ago. This would mean that the Red Kings reigned for about 2,000 years and were constantly fighting the Starks during that time period (not even counting later Bolton rebellions, of which there were several). The Starks rallied all of the other Northern Houses including the Boltons to fight back the Andal invaders when they landed on the coasts, or when they tried to pass through the overland choke point at Moat Cailin.
            The territory controlled by the Red Kings of House Bolton apparently covered lands beyond what the Boltons currently possess - perhaps the Karstark lands to the north and Hornwood lands to the south. The Umbers were said to also be independent kings in this time period so they didn't control them, while White Harbor and lands to the south (now held by the Manderlys) passed through several hands. Apparently the Boltons never controlled much territory west of the White Knife River.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Red_King</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRedKing</string></dict>

            Cotter Pyke is a senior member of the Night's Watch. He serves as commander of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, the eastern-most castle on the Wall. He is a bastard, born on the Iron Islands.
            Lord Commander Jeor Mormont tells Jon Snow that Cotter Pyke's rangers found four wights outside of Eastwatch and wisely burned their corpses.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cotter Pyke is the bastard son of a tavern wench. He betrays his common origins by being plain, even rough-speaking, with a broken nose. Despite his origins, Cotter Pyke is also considered to be a highly effective and able commander, and stands high in the ranks of the Night's Watch. He holds a level of disdain for, and is essentially the opposite to, Ser Denys Mallister, the commander of The Shadow Tower, who is a highborn knight.
            In "A Dance with Dragons" Cotter Pyke, not Tormund, is given the assignment of bringing the Wildlings from Hardhome. He and his crew are in great danger, in view of his second report to Jon. Just as Jon arranges a rescue party, he is attacked by his own men. The commotion makes the people at Castle Black forget about Cotter Pyke's predicament. By the end of the novel, it is unknown what is the status of him and his men, if any of them is still alive.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cotter_Pyke</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCotterPyke</string></dict>

            Cohollo is a Dothraki bloodrider in the service of Khal Drogo. He is one of Drogo's closest allies and a stalwart warrior who favors the Arakh.
            Cohollo, alongside Qotho and Haggo, accompanies Khal Drogo to view his bride, Daenerys Targaryen.[1]
            When a drunken Viserys threatens Daenerys and her unborn child, Qotho and Cohollo restrain him while Drogo pours molten gold over his head, killing him.[2]
            Following the raid of a Lhazareen village in Lhazar, Mago defies Drogo. Cohollo, along with his fellow bloodriders, steps forward to defendÂ Drogo's honor, only for the Khal to take matters in his own hands.[3]
            Drogo's wound festers and he becomes seriously ill. He falls from his horse in front of the khalasar, a sign of great weakness. Daenerys and then Cohollo kneel to the sides of the khal to check on him, while Qotho and Haggo remain mounted. Later, when Qotho takes Mirri Maz Duur to Drogo and Daenerys's tent, Cohollo accompanies him.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cohollo is the eldest of Drogo's three bloodriders and the most kind to Daenerys. He had saved Drogo from sellswords when he was very young. He's described as a squat bald man with a crooked nose and a mouth full of broken teeth.
            During the wedding of Daenerys and Drogo, Cohollo gives them a arakh chased in gold. When the three bloodriders attempt to stop the Mirri Maz Duur's blood magic ritual to heal Drogo, Cohollo is killed by Aggo.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cohollo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCohollo</string></dict>

After their unstable rule was brought to an end, House Stark of Winterfell became the ruling house with King in the North Brandon Stark the Builder. However, many Kings did not respect their rule either, including the Warg King. This started the Thousand Years War, in which The Warg King was defeated and killed at Sea Dragon Point. All the beasts that he could Warg into were killed, as were his son. Therefore, he was the last King of his people, and his legacy would never continue.

Leaf pressed a dragonglass dagger into his chest, causing his eyes to turn blue and turning him into the first of the White Walkers. Thousands of years later, Leaf tells Bran Stark that her people created the White Walkers to defend themselves when Westeros was invaded by the First Men, who were cutting their sacred trees and slaughtering the Children of the Forest.[1]
            The Night King is a legendary figure, known by name among, at least, some noble houses in the North.[2]
            The Night King first appears in a vision that Bran Stark has, when Bran communes with a Weirwood Heart tree. He experiences a flood of images from the past, present, and future, many of which he was not physically present for. He does not comprehend what all of these images are. In retrospect, one of them is an image of the Night King picking up the last of Craster's sons off an ice altar.[3]
            After RastÂ places Craster's final son on the ground in the Haunted Forest, a White WalkerÂ riding an undead horse approaches and takes the baby, carrying it towards a shattered mountain in theÂ Lands of Always Winter.
            Once inside, the White Walker approaches an icy altar ringed by large icy spikesÂ and places the baby upon the altar. In the distance, a group of thirteen black-garbed White Walkers are revealed to be viewing the proceedings from afar.Â One of themÂ breaks from the middle of their number and approaches the altar, stopping to regard the human child for a momentÂ before gently gathering him in its arms. The baby immediately calms, staring into the face of the Night King, who has a crown of horns jutting from his head. HeÂ places his index finger upon the baby's cheek, causing the child's eyes to turn icy blue and its skin to grow pale: most likely the fate ofÂ Craster's other sons.[4]
            The Night King appears again when Jon Snow and Tormund Giantsbane are coordinating the evacuation of Hardhome. He appears to be leading the attack, or is at least observing it with some other White Walkers, and watches from one of the cliffs above the town as Jon slays one of his lieutenants with Longclaw. The Night King looks on this turn of events with mild interest, as he didn't think anybody would put up any sort of meaningful resistance. As Jon, Tormund and the remaining defenders leave on the boat, the Night King appears on the dock and locks eyes with Jon. With a mere raise of his arms, the Night King raises the entirety of Hardhome's erstwhile defenders as wights, and keeps his gaze upon Jon as the boat slips away.[5]
            The Night King appears in one of Bran Stark's visions, where he witnesses him as a human being transformed into a White Walker by the Children of the Forest, notably among them Leaf. She explains after his vision that they had to do it because they were at war with the First Men.
            Later, Bran makes the risky decision to experience a vision on his own, and finds himself looking at an army of wights and the Night King and other White Walkers at the back. Bran walks closer and is shocked to see that the Night King notices his presence. Bran wakes up screaming after the Night King suddenly appears right next to him and grabs his arm.
            The Three-Eyed Raven says that the Night King touched him, which Bran confirms when a blue hand-mark is seen on his forearm. The Three-Eyed Raven says because of that mark, the Night King now knows exactly where they are, and the cave cannot protect them any more.
            The Night King and his army quickly travel to the cave, preceded by their aura of cold, a signal to the Children of the Forest and Meera Reed. The Children of the Forest prepare their scarce defenses outside of the cave, but are quickly overrun and they are forced to retreat back to the tunnels. The Night King sends his army of wights to attack the tunnels, and they kill most of the Children and Summer, though Bran, Meera Reed and Hodor manage to escape the cavern through a back tunnel. One of the other White Walkers is killed by a dragonglass-tipped spear thrown by Meera. The Night King enters the cavern, and glares at the warging Three-Eyed Raven before he kills him.
            The Night King then sends the rest of his wights to kill Leaf, and eventually, Hodor, who attempts to stop the wights from going further by sacrificing himself to hold the door.[1]
            While Meera drags Bran through the snow, Bran sees visions of the Night King converting Craster's last son into a White Walker, leading a massive attack on Hardhome, and branding him with his mark.
            In the aftermath of his victory at Winterfell and the confirmation from the Citadel that winter has come through white ravens, Jon Snow tells the gathered lords of the North and the Vale who wish to return home following Ramsay Bolton's defeat to prepare for winter. He warns that the war is not over after Cley Cerwyn suggests it is with the defeat of House Bolton, alluding to the Night King as their true enemy, warning that the Night King won't wait out the winter storms, because he is the one who brings the storm.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night_King</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascNightKing</string></dict>
        <key>Corlys Velaryon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.258.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Corlys was married to Rhaenys Targaryen, the sister of Viserys I Targaryen, and at some point gave her a child, Laenor, who married his wife's neice Rhaenyra Targaryen. Corlys was the greatest of lords that swore allegiance to Rhaenyra Targaryen, as he commanded the largest fleet in the realm, during the Dance of the Dragons. During this conflict, his wife perished at the hands of their nephews, Aegon II Targaryen and Aemond Targaryen.
            
            Corlys was named after SerÂ Corlys Velaryon, the firstÂ Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Corlys once sailed hisÂ Ice Wolf beyond the WallÂ but was unsuccessful in find a northerly route aroundÂ Westeros. He then sailed aboard hisÂ Sea SnakeÂ on multiple voyages toÂ Essos, accumulating wealth from visits toÂ Qarth,Â Yi Ti, andÂ Leng. Corlys was the firstÂ WesterosiÂ to visit NeferÂ inÂ N'GhaiÂ and to navigate theÂ Thousand Islands.Â During his last travel, Corlys filled theÂ Sea Snake's hold with gold and bought twenty more ships at Qarth, loading them with spices, elephants, and silk. Corlys took his nickname from his famous ship, the expeditions of which are described in MaesterÂ Mathis'sÂ The Nine Voyages.
            Corlys became head ofÂ House VelaryonÂ after the death of his grandsire. Richer than LordsÂ LannisterÂ orÂ HightowerÂ through his expeditions, Corlys used his great wealth to construct a new seat,Â High Tide, where he stored his eastern treasures.
            Lord Corlys and his fleets fought alongside PrinceÂ Daemon TargaryenÂ during theÂ War for the Stepstones. When Daemon declared himself theÂ King of the Stepstones and the Narrow Sea, Corlys placed the crown on the new king's head.
            The children of Corlys and PrincessÂ Rhaenys TargaryenÂ both died inÂ 120 AC,Â Laena VelaryonÂ from childbed fever and Ser Laenor VelaryonÂ from a quarrel with SerÂ Qarl Correy. Later in the same year Prince Daemon, Laena's widower, married PrincessÂ Rhaenyra Targaryen, Laenor's widow.
            InÂ 126 ACÂ Corlys was struck with a sudden fever; the issue arose of who would succeed him as Lord of the Tides should he die. With his trueborn children dead by law the title would go to his grandson by Rhaenyra,Â Jacaerys Velaryon. However, Jacaerys would presumably ascend the Iron Throne after his mother and so Rhaenyra urged him to nameÂ Lucerys VelaryonÂ as his heir. The Sea Snake also had six nephews and the eldest, SerÂ Vaemond Velaryon, protested that the lordship should pass to him on the grounds that Rhaenyra's sons wereÂ bastardsÂ sired by SerÂ Harwin Strong. The Velaryon protesters were dealt with by the Targaryens and Lord Corlys presumably recovered.
            Lord Corlys Velaryon sat on theÂ black councilÂ during the civil war known as theÂ Dance of the Dragons; he was the greatest lord to pledge his strength to the cause of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, who was opposed by her half-brother, KingÂ Aegon II Targaryen. More than half of Rhaenyra's army was made up of men sworn toÂ House Velaryon. Corlys's fleets also gaveÂ the blacksÂ superiority at sea.
            When LordÂ Bartimos CeltigarÂ urged the princess to fly fromÂ DragonstoneÂ toÂ Kingâs LandingÂ at once and reduce the city to ash and bone, Corlys demanded to know how that would serve them, telling him "we want to rule the city, not burn it to the ground".
            The Sea Snake commanded the Velaryon fleet when it closed off theÂ GulletÂ and sailed back and forth from Dragonstone andÂ Driftmark, blocking all shipping entering or leaving Blackwater BayÂ and thereby choking off trade to and from King's Landing. Eventually, the Velaryon blockade was broken by theÂ Battle in the GulletÂ andÂ High TideÂ was sacked.
            On Dragonstone, after receiving the news that his wife, PrincessÂ Rhaenys, hadÂ fallen at Rook's RestÂ trying to come to the aid of LordÂ Staunton, angry words were exchanged between the queen and Lord Velaryon. Corlys blamed Rhaenyra for his wife Rhaenys's death. He told Rhaenyra that it should have been her who died, that "Staunton sent to you, yet you left it to my wife to answer, and forbade your sons to join her!" All the castle knew that PrincesÂ JacaerysÂ andÂ Joffrey VelaryonÂ had been eager to fly with her toÂ Rook's RestÂ with their own dragons.
            In lateÂ 129 AC, Prince Jacaerys brought the Lord of the Tides back into the fold by naming himÂ Hand of the Queen. Together the Hand and Jacaerys planned an assault upon Kingâs Landing. Not long after, one of the riderless dragons,Â Seasmoke, took onto his back a fifteen-year-old boy known as Addam ofÂ Hull. Lord Corlys went so far as to petition Queen Rhaenyra to remove the taint ofÂ bastardyÂ from Addam and his brother,Â Alyn. The queen complied andÂ Addam VelaryonÂ became Corlys's heir toÂ Driftmark.
            After the queen took King's Landing, as LordÂ Ormund Hightower's host advanced slowly on King's Landing, with PrinceÂ DaeronÂ scouting ahead on theÂ Blue Queen, Lord Corlys suggested to Rhaenyra that the time had come to talk. He urged the queen to offer pardons. He proposed to let theÂ Faith of the SevenÂ take charge of QueenÂ Alicent Hightowerand QueenÂ Helaena Targaryen, so that they might spend the rest of their lives in prayer and contemplation. Corlys suggested that PrincessÂ Jaehaera Targaryen, the daughter of Rhaenyra's rival, King Aegon II, be made his own ward, and in due time married to Rhaenyra's son, PrinceÂ Aegon the Younger, binding the two halves ofÂ House Targaryen together once again.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Corlys_Velaryon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCorlysVelaryon</string></dict>
        <key>Cley Cerwyn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.259.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Cley Cerwyn is a northern lord and the new head of House Cerwyn after the death of his father, Medger Cerwyn.
            Roose Bolton sends his recently legitimized bastard son Ramsay to Castle Cerwyn to collect taxes from his new vassals. Medger Cerwyn, however, refuses to pay, proudly professing his loyalty to House Stark and denouncing Bolton as a turncoat. For his defiance, Ramsay has Medger flayed alive, along with his wife and brother, all the while forcing Cley to watch the ordeal. Cley begrudgingly pays Ramsay the taxes in his father's stead, as Ramsay relays to his father.[1]
            While amassing a force to help him retake Winterfell from the Boltons, Jon Snow sends ravens to numerous Northern Houses pleading for help, one of them House Cerwyn. Despite Ramsay having flayed his family alive, Cley refuses Jon's pleas, though Sansa Stark expresses confidence that they can get Cley's help if they ask him personally.
            Cley later joins the other Northern Lords gathered in Winterfell after the Battle of the Bastards. With the Boltons defeated, Lord Cerwyn notes that the newly arrived winter is expected to be the coldest in a thousand years and advocates returning to their homes to wait out the cold, claiming that the war is effectively over (as the Lannisters are unlikely to send troops to the freezing North solely to avenge the Boltons). Jon Snow responds by saying that the war is not over and the new enemy won't allow them to wait out the storm; he brings the storm. Lord Cerwyn is one of the lords chastised by Lady Lyanna Mormont for not aiding Jon against Ramsay, despite Ramsay having flayed his family alive. A repentant Lord Cerwyn declares Jon as the new King in the North along with the other Northern lords.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cley is the son of Lord Medger Cerwyn, who died of wounds he took at the Battle of the Green Fork.
            While Ramsay Bolton did not kill Medger in the novels, he did kill his son Cley Cerwyn, at the Sack of Winterfell. When Rodrik Cassel hastily assembled a force to besiege Theon Greyjoy in Winterfell, composed of about 2,000 men from the few household soldiers left in the North, 300 of them were Cerwyn men led by Cley. Ramsay then arrived with 600 Bolton men, whom Rodrik and his lieutenants welcomed as their allies - but as soon as they were in the camp Ramsay's men betrayed the other Northern bannermen in a surprise attack, taking them totally off-guard. When Rodrik walked up to greet Ramsay by extending his hand in friendship, Ramsay quickly drew his sword and cut off Rodrik's outstretched arm at the elbow. Cley Cerwyn was killed in the betrayal by an arrow to the eye.
            After Cley's death, Jonelle Cerwyn, his elder sister becomes the Lady of Cerwyn. Like the show version of Cley, she begrudgingly swears allegiance to House Bolton.
            Cley Cerwyn's death from the books was therefore omitted from the TV series, but his entire existence in the first place was omitted until he was mentioned in Season 5. Thus it is unclear why the TV continuity didn't simply keep Jonelle Cerwyn as the new head of House Cerwyn after Medger's death. This has been part of a repeated pattern in the TV series of genderswapping female political rulers into male ones. Given that Cley is dead in the books, it is likely he will die in a later season in the television series.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cley_Cerwyn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCleyCerwyn</string></dict>
        <key>Cleon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.260.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cleon was one of the thousands of slaves liberated after the Sack of Astapor.
            Cleon was one of the thousands of slaves liberated after the Sack of Astapor. A former butcher of meats, he is commonly known as "Cleon the Butcher".
            Jorah Mormont reports to Daenerys Targaryen that the council she had left behind to rule Astapor has been overthrown by Cleon, who styles himself as "His Imperial Majesty."[1]
            After the burning of the Meereen shipyards, Varys informs Tyrion Lannister, Grey Worm, and Missandei that the slave-masters have now retaken not only Yunkai but Astapor as well, leaving Meereen as the only part of Slaver's Bay that the slavers haven't reclaimed. Cleon's fate is unmentioned but he presumably perished when his junta of vengeful freedmen at Astapor was defeated.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cleon was once a slave owned by Grazdan mo Ullhor, serving as a butcher. It was said he could cut up a pig faster than any other man in Astapor. After gaining his freedom, Cleon stirs up the people of Astapor, claiming that the council is attempting to reinstate the deposed Good Masters. With the backing of the people, Cleon executes the council members and installs himself as king. At his command, every highborn boy in Astapor is seized to make new Unsullied for the trade. Daenerys ruefully notes that she didn't end slavery in Astapor: all that changed is that the old slaves are now the masters and the old masters are now the slaves. She feels sick when a Qartheen ship captain describes what Cleon has done to Astapor: "The city bleeds. Dead men rot unburied in the streets, each pyramid is an armed camp, and the markets have neither food nor slaves for sale. And the poor children! King Cleaver's thugs have seized every highborn boy in Astapor to make new Unsullied for the trade, though it will be years before they are trained."
            Cleon styles himself as "Cleon the Great", though he is often called "the Butcher King" (because he used to be a butcher). The TV series added the detail that he styles himself as "His Imperial Majesty" - thus while he proclaimed himself "King Cleon" in the books, it isn't clear if his official title is "Emperor Cleon" in the TV series.
            After the initial surprise of Daenerys's campaign against slavery in the region wears off, Yunkai begins to regroup and hires a large number of sellsword companies to conquer their lost territories and property; it also forms an alliance of various powers also involved in the slave-trade, from Qarth in the east to Volantis in the west, and also Tolos and Mantarys on the western side of Slaver's Bay.
            With Yunkai between Meereen to the north and Astapor to the south, Cleon sends repeated entreaties to Daenerys that she marry him in order to forge an alliance and march in open war against Yunkai - but Daenerys declines, because she loathes Cleon for his actions, and also because she fears that if her army leaves Meereen, her domestic enemies (the Meereenese noble Houses and the Sons of the Harpy) will completely take over the city while it is gone. Cleon continues to insist that they must attack Yunkai while they still can, as the slaver-alliance's armies are growing larger with each passing month. Her answer is "Astapor is starving. Let King Cleon feed his people before he leads them out to battle".
            After being repeatedly declined by Daenerys, Cleon decides he cannot afford to wait any longer, and foolishly marches his army out against Yunkai without her, despite being outnumbered and outarmed. His freedmen are not very well organized as a fighting force, however, and his new Unsullied are considered a joke by everyone including Daenerys - the real Unsullied she has were the result of a lifetime of training since childhood, but Cleon's Unsullied are just a pale imitation, given only a few months' training and made by seizing boys from the former slave-master families.
            Xaro visits Daenerys, informing her that Cleon's amateur army has joined in battle with Yunkai and its allies at the Horns of Hazzat, and predictably suffers a crippling defeat. Cleon and the few survivors flee back to Astapor. Shortly later, a messenger from Meereen appears before Daenerys, telling her that armies of the Yunkaiâi descend on Astapor, and begs her to send assistance to Cleon. Daenerys feels sorry for the citizens of Astapor, but hardens her heart and rejects Cleon's pleading for the same reasons she did before. Cleon is soon killed by one of his own men for his failure, which revealed his weakness.
            After that Astapor suffers a rapid succession of juntas from one faction or another: "Cleon II" holds power for only eight days before being killed by a barber dubbed "King Cuthroat", while Cleon II's remaining supporters rally behind his concubine, dubbed "Queen Whore". The two factions fight for control of what is left of Astapor even as Yunkai's army closes in and besieges them. Plague soon sets in, and before long the city falls to Yunkai's army in a bloodbath.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cleon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCleon</string></dict>
        <key>Kovarro</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.261.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kovarro is a Dothraki bloodrider servingÂ Daenerys Targaryen.
            Kovarro is a Dothraki warrior in Khal Drogo's khalasar. He is not seen in the first season but has been guarding Drogo's wife Daenerys Targaryen since their marriage. Drogo is wounded and later dies leading to the separation of his khalasar. Following Drogo's death,Â Daenerys hatches three dragon eggs in his funeral pyre and Kovarro swears his loyalty to her. She names him as one of her bloodriders alongside Rakharo and Aggo.[1][2]
            Daenerys leads what remains of her khalasar deep into the Red Waste. Facing starvation she sends Rakharo, Aggo and Kovarro to scout in three different directions, using the last remaining horses. Kovarro is sent east.[3] He finds the city of Qarth and is met by the ruling council called the Thirteen. Hearing of the dragons they invite Daenerys to the city. They give  Kovarro a replacement horse for his ride back into the Red Waste. He returns to the khalasar and reports his discovery that Qarth is three days to the east, on the sea. When Daenerys asks Ser Jorah Mormont what he knows of Qarth he tells her that the desert around it is known as the Garden of Bones because it is littered with the remains of travellers who have been refused entry to the city. Kovarro leads the khalasar to Qarth, but the Thirteen refuse to admit them without seeing the dragons. Daenerys threatens them and they are admitted under the protection of Xaro Xhoan Daxos.[4]Xaro welcomes Daenerys into his home, giving her people accommodation and buying her gifts. He throws a reception for her in his gardens. Several of her khalasar are also present. Daenerys is distracted by Jorah Mormont, Kovarro and Malakho gathering around a bejewelled golden peacock statue. She asks Ser Jorah what they are doing and he reports that they are discussing stealing the statue. Malakho thinks that it is too heavy but Kovarro believes that they can parcel out the weight by prying out the jewels and chopping up the soft gold. Daenerys admonishes her bloodrider to show more respect for their host. He says that he will wait until they leave and she cautions him not to steal from the man who saved them from the Red Waste. Kovarro and Malakho walk off. Kovarro takes a goblet from a passing servant, emptying the liquid from it.[5]
            Kovarro accompanies Daenerys to a meeting with the Spice King who refuses to invest in her return to Westeros. When they return to Xaro's home, they find that it has been attacked. Irri and several Dothraki warriors have been killed along with some of Xaro's guards and the dragons have been stolen.[6]
            Kovarro stands guard for Daenerys when she appears before the Thirteen to appeal for their help. They are stunned when Pyat Pree admits to the theft and proclaims Xaro the king of Qarth. Pyat uses his magic to murder the rest of the Thirteen. Kovarro ushers Daenerys out of the meeting room. Pree's doubles follow them and invites Daenerys to reclaim her children at the House of the Undying.[7] They take refuge in a disused courtyard and Daenerys convinces Jorah to accompany her to reclaim her dragons despite their certainty that it is a trap.[8]
            Kovarro aids Ser Jorah and Daenerys to the House of the Undying. He stands guard and waits for her return. Later he is by her side when Dany discovers Doreah and Xaro in bed, and confines them to the empty chamber. He helps raid the palace of any gold and silver.[9]
            In A Song of Ice and Fire, after Khal Drogo dies and Daenerys hatches her dragons, her three bloodriders are Aggo (who is skilled with a bow), Jhogo (who is skilled with a whip), and Rakharo (who is skilled with a sword). In the books, Jhogo is very young, while Rakharo is older and has a moustache. In the TV series, her three bloodriders are Aggo, Rakharo, and "Kovarro" -- Jhogo was apparently renamed to avoid confusion with Jhaqo, one of Drogo's kos who after Drogo is incapacitated declares himself Khal and takes a portion of the khalassar as his own. Jhaqo thus becomes a bitter enemy to Daenerys, so Jhogo was renamed to "Kovarro" to keep his name distinct.
            More importantly, the TV series seems to have basically switched the descriptions of Rakharo and Jhogo/Kovarro. In the TV series, it is Rakharo who shows proficiency with a whip, and is relatively young, like Jhogo/Kovarro in the books. Meanwhile, Jhogo/Kovarro in the TV series is now (slightly) older than TV-Rakharo, and it is Kovarro who has a moustache. Thus the TV series character "Kovarro" corresponds to the book-version of Rakharo. Besides this name switch, the two characters are not particularly different from their characterization in the books.
            The new name "Kovarro" was created by the writers, based on the guide to making new Dothraki names that language consultant David J. Peterson developed for them. As Peterson explained in his blog: "Our new name Kovarro, then, derives from the verb kovarat, which means 'to stand'. Kovarro, then, is kind of like 'stander (who is male)': a tough guy who stands his ground."[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Kovarro</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascKovarro</string></dict>

        <key>Qotho</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.263.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Qotho was a bloodrider to Khal Drogo. He was killed in a duel with Ser Jorah Mormont after Drogo falls ill. Qotho tries to prevent Mirri Maz Duur from treating Drogo and Jorah intervenes.
            Qotho is a Dothraki bloodrider in the service of Khal Drogo. He is one of Drogo's closest allies and a stalwart warrior who favors the Arakh.
            Qotho, alongside Cohollo and Haggo, accompanies Khal Drogo to view his bride, Daenerys Targaryen.[1] Qotho is present for the wedding of Drogo and Daenerys and then rides East with them to Vaes Dothrak.[2] When a drunken Viserys threatens Daenerys and her unborn child, Qotho breaks his arm and then restrains him while Drogo pours molten gold over his head, killing him.[3]
            Qotho is present when Drogo declares that he will lead the khalasar across the Narrow Sea and invade Westeros in vengeance for the attempted assassination of Daenerys.[4] Qotho participates in the Khalasar's raid of a village in Lhazar, a peaceful country to the south-east of Vaes Dothrak. When Mago defies Drogo, Qotho, along with his fellow bloodriders, steps forward to defendÂ Drogo's honor, only for the Khal to take matters into his own hands. He objects to the Lhazareen godswife Mirri Maz Duur treating a small wound Drogo takes, calling her Maegi.[5]
            Drogo's wound festers and he becomes seriously ill. He falls from his horse in front of the Khalasar, a sign of weakness. While Cohollo comes down from his horse and kneels to Drogo's side, Qotho and Haggo remain mounted. Daenerys orders the khalasar to take camp, but Qotho objects, though he ultimately relents. Later Daenerys calls for Duur, who says that only blood magic can save him. Duur claims that she needs to kill Drogo's horse. Qotho objects to the ritual and a fight ensues; Qotho pushes Dany to the ground causing her to go into premature labor. Ser Jorah Mormont intervenes and engages Qotho in a vicious duel. Though Qotho takes the upper hand with his younger age and superior speed, his arakh is unable to penetrate Jorah's armor, giving Jorah enough time to finish him off, slashing him across the face with his sword.[6]
            Jorah mentions to a slave trader, Malko, that he killed Qotho in single combat, which convinces Malko to take Jorah and Tyrion Lannister to Meereen in order to sponsor Jorah in the fighting pits that Daenerys has re-opened. At the slave sale, however, Malko changes the story slightly and claims that Jorah actually killed Khal Drogo.[7]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Qotho is a skilled warrior, but he is also considered to be cruel and malicious, the least-likable of Drogo's three bloodriders. He has cruel eyes and quick hands that liked to hurt. Occasionally he molests Daenerys's handmaidens Doreah  and Irri, leaving them bruised and sobbing. Even his horses seem to fear him.
            In the books, Drogo's three bloodriders are Qotho, Cohollo, and Haggo. All three attempt to intervene when Mirri Maz Duur conducts her ritual to heal Drogo, and all three are killed in the resulting fight. Qotho was personally killed by Jorah, just as in the TV series. Unidentified extras fill in some of the actions carried out by Cohollo and Haggo but do not take part in the fight with Ser Jorah, so all three have been functionally condensed into Qotho.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Qotho</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascQotho</string></dict>

They are later slaughtered when a group of wildlings led by Tormund and Styr attack the village. News of their deaths soon reaches Castle Black.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Kegs is a Builder of the Night's Watch. He is noted to be slow. He is not killed in a wildling attack on Mole's Town. During the battle, while retreating with other defenders to the stair, Kegs is caught and nearly killed by a Thenn, but he is saved by a crossbow shot from Satin. So far he is alive and well.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Kegs</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascKegs</string></dict>

        <key>Karl Tanner</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.266.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Karl Tanner was a brother of the Night's Watch who had gone north of the Wall on Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's Great Ranging. Karl led a mutiny at Craster'sÂ Keep in which he and his fellow mutineers â mostly ex-criminals â killed Craster and Mormont, but he and his comrades were later tracked down and killed by a party of the Night's Watch led by Jon Snow.
            Karl Tanner hails from Gin Alley in Flea Bottom, King's Landing, where he was apparently revered as a legend, making a name for himself as a highly-capable enforcer, assassin, and cutthroat.[1] Karl was eventually sent to the Wall and became a ranger of the Night's Watch. He takes part in the Great Ranging.
            His fighting style favored speed and using small, fast weapons like daggers to quickly stab and deliver killing blows. This style reflected his background inÂ Flea BottomÂ where he fought in tight, confined spaces and had to use small, easily-concealed weapons to avoid being caught by the City Watch.
            Karl survives the White Walkers' attack on the Fist of the First Men, and regroups with his fellow survivors as they attempt to pull back to the Wall.[2]
            When the Watch arrive at Craster's Keep seeking food and shelter, Karl is openly antagonistic towards Craster, accusing him of giving his pigs better food than them. Along with Rast, he shows an interest in Craster's daughter-wives.[3]
            Following the death and funeral of Bannen, as tensions between Craster and the brothers of the Watch run higher, Karl insults Craster - calling him "a daughter-fucking wildling bastard" - after the wildling demands the Watch to leave his hall and threatens to kill anyone who insults him. Craster charges against Karl with an axe but the black brother easily kills him by quickly closing the distance between them, blocking Craster's attackÂ by grabbing the wrist of his weapon hand, andÂ stabbing him in the throat with a dagger. Lord Commander Mormont threatens to have Karl executed for this, until Rast stabs Mormont in the back, visibly shocking Karl. A brutal fight ensues among the black brothers. Grenn charges at Karl, who is reluctant to kill his fellow brother and ends up tackled by him. [4]
            Grenn and Edd arrive at Castle Black after escaping from their captivity at Craster's Keep. They revealÂ thatÂ KarlÂ is theÂ ringleader of the mutineers,Â andÂ that they are content with staying at the keep, eating Craster's food, and raping his daughter-wives.[5]
            âJon SnowÂ then points out that they know about the small garrison at Castle BlackÂ andÂ proposes that they should be killed so they won't disclose it to the wildlings.[5]
            At Craster's Keep, Karl drinks wine from the skull of Jeor Mormont, drunkenly bragging about himself and his skill as a hired killer back in King's Landing before ordering Rast to "feed the beast". One of Craster's former wives enters the Keep and presents Karl with Craster's last child, a son. The women call for it to be given to the gods, which Karl realizes must refer to the White Walkers. Realizing that this was how Craster protected himself from the White Walkers, Karl ordersÂ RastÂ to take the child out into the forest, leaving it behind. Soon after, Bran, Jojen, and Meera are captured and taken to Karl, who threatens to kill Meera and Jojen until Bran admits his true identity as Jon Snow's half-brother.[6]
            With his new captives in hand, Karl attempts to rape Meera, but is interrupted when Jon Snow and a handful of the Night's Watch storm Craster's Keep. Karl duels Jon and initially Karl gains the upper hand, because his daggers are better suited to the cramped space inside the building than Jon's sword, and he uses dirty tactics like spitting in Jon's face to distract him. Before he can finish Jon, however, one of Craster's daughter-wives stabs Karl in the shoulder, prompting him to instead motion to kill her. By doing this, however, he neglects one of the principal tenets of combat (never turn your back on an opponent) and pays for this when Jon snatches up Longclaw and drives her through the back of Karl's head, killing him.
            Karl's body is later burned along with those of the remaining mutineers and slain brothers inside the Keep to ensure that they cannot come back as Wights.[7] Though gone, Karl's dirty tactics enable Jon to later defeat Styr in battle.[8]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Karl, called Clubfoot Karl, is a steward of the Night's Watch. Along with Chett, Lark the Sisterman, Paul, Dirk, Ollo Lophand, Donnel Hill and others, he had conspired to kill Lord Commander Mormont, Sam and other individuals and desert the Watch, but their plan was interrupted by the sudden snowfall and the subsequent White Walkers' attack. He is among the traitors who mutiny against Lord Commander Mormont. However, Dirk - not Karl - is the one who kills Craster and takes one of his wives as hostage. Like the TV version of Karl, Dirk is a ranger.
            Karl taunts Craster by calling him niggard and liar, and also speaks rudely to Mormont. However, he is not the leader of the traitors; he is not the one who provokes Craster by calling him "bastard"; and does not take active part in the pursuing brawl.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Karl_Tanner</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascKarlTanner</string></dict>

            Stonesnake is a ranger of the Night's Watch.
            After meeting the force led by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont at the Fist of the First Men, Qhorin Halfhand selects Stonesnake, Harker, and Borba for a scouting party to ambush a group of wildling lookouts. They are joined by Jon Snow.[1] They locate and surprise the lookouts, killing all but one of them. Jon is left to execute the wildling survivor, Ygritte.[2] Jon does not return and they return for him. They pick up his tracks but are ambushed by wildlings. Harker, Stonesnake and Borba are killed while Qhorin is captured. Jon had spared the captive and she leads him into a similar ambush. Jon blames himself for their deaths, and Qhorin tells him to make sure it wasn't in vain. Qhorin seizes the opportunity to insert Jon as an infiltrator in the wildling ranks by berating him for the deaths of the others publicly.[3]
            In the Song of Ice and Fire novels, Stonesnake is also a Ranger serving under Qhorin Halfhand. He is short and wiry man, near fifty with a grey beard. He is stronger than he looks, and has the best night-eyes of anyone Jon has ever known. He's dubbed Stonesnake for his ability for climbing mountains and cliffs.
            Stonesnake leads the mission to scale the Skirling Pass at night to ambush a trio of wildling watchers. He and Jon kill two of the sentries (one of them is Orell). He expresses distrust in Ygritte and later informs Qhorin of what she told Jon.
            In the novels, his fate is uncertain. After his horse panics and breaks its leg, he offers to stay behind and fight the pursuing wildlings like Dalbridge, but Qhorin orders him to make it through the Frostfangs afoot to the Fist, and to tell Mormont what they saw. Jon watches asÂ Stonesnake goes away, and fears that he has no chance. Stonesnake has not been mentioned since. While it has not been confirmed that he died, according to the novels appendix he was lost afoot in the Skirling Pass.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Stonesnake</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascStonesnake</string></dict>
        <key>Jon Arryn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.270.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Jon Arryn was the Lord of the Eyrie, Lord Paramount of the Vale, Warden of the East, and the head of House Arryn. He served as the first Hand of the King to Robert Baratheon until he died of mysterious circumstances.
            Jon Arryn was the Lord of the Eyrie and the head of House Arryn, one of the Great Houses of Westeros.
            Jon was the Warden of the East and Defender of the Vale. He was a respected nobleman and both Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon were fostered by him during their adolescence.[1] The Mad King condoned the alleged kidnapping of Eddard's sister, Lyanna, who was also Robert's betrothed, and demanded that Eddard and Robert, still in the Vale, be turned over to the King's justice. Instead, Lord Arryn rebelled, calling his banners to war. House Stark and House Baratheon followed suit. The rebels forged an alliance with House Tully through marriage, with Eddard married to Catelyn Tully and the then-elderly Jon to the young Lysa Tully.[1][2]
            Jon Arryn died in King's Landing immediately prior to the events of the series, sparking King Robert's search for a replacement. Jon is survived by his wife Lysa and their six-year-old son, Robin Arryn.[2]Â Near the end of his life, Jon was investigating the legitimacy of the children of Queen Consort,Â Cersei Lannister. He later died from unknown, and unexplained, causes just after discovering that the children were secretly not the biological children of Robert Baratheon.
            His dying words were to Robert Baratheon, "The seed is strong."
            Jon Arryn's body is laid out in state in the throne room of the Red Keep in King's Landing. Ser Jaime Lannister and Queen Cersei discuss Jon's attempts to learn the truth about their incestuous relationship and his failure to do so. Later, news of Jon's death reaches Eddard Stark at Winterfell, who is shocked and upset as he considered Jon to be a second father to him. CatelynÂ then receives a letter from LysaÂ accusing House Lannister for murdering Jon.[2]
            When Eddard Stark attends his first Small Council meeting in King's Landing, he is shocked to learn that the realm is six million Gold Dragons in debt, and refuses to believe that Jon Arryn would let this happen. Grand Maester Pycelle and Renly Baratheon explain to Lord Stark that while Jon gave wise and prudent advice, King Robert did not always follow it.[3]
            Arryn had asked Pycelle for The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, a book detailing genealogies of the nobility, which notes the heredity preponderance for black hair in House Baratheon.[4]
            Eddard Stark is told that Arryn visited with an armorer, Tobho Mott, several times before his death and also talked with his apprentice Gendry, inquiring about his mother. Stark immediately realizes upon meeting with Gendry that he is King Robert's bastard son.[4]" On the day he died, Arryn met with Mhaegen, a prostitute at Lord Petyr Baelish's brothel. She showed him her infant daughter, Barra, who was fathered by King Robert Baratheon.[5]
            Varys privately warns Eddard that he thinks Jon Arryn was murdered by an unknown party for asking too many questions, using a rare and untraceable poison known as the Tears of Lys.[5]
            Under forceful interrogation by Tyrion Lannister, Grand Maester Pycelle confesses that he knew that Jon Arryn had unearthed the truth upon seeing Robert's bastard children that Queen Cersei's three children were not conceivedÂ by Robert, but by her twin brother Jaime Lannister. Pycelle states that Jon Arryn intended to act and reveal his discovery to King Robert. When Tyrion accuses Pycelle of having Jon poisoned to keep the truth from getting out, he angrily denies that he killed him. Tyrion then points out that Pycelle must have realized that someone had poisoned Arryn (and he wasn't simply sick), but he let him succumb anyway, so he has Pycelle thrown into the Black Cells.[6]
            After being reunited with Petyr Baelish, Lysa obsessively declares her love for him and the things she has done to demonstrate it, including lacing Jon's wine with Tears of Lys and then sending a letter to Catelyn accusing House Lannister of the assassination.[7]
            Eventually, Petyr is forced to answer for his many crimes, including his role in the Assassination of Jon Arryn, when Sansa Stark unexpectedly puts him on trial. Sansa publicly accuses Petyr of persuading Lysa (whom Petyr also murdered) to poison Jon with Tears of Lys and write a letter to her sister Catelyn, falsely accusing the Lannisters of killing her husband, igniting the conflict between both great houses. When Petyr's guilt becomes plain for all to see, his cries for mercy are coldly rebuffed by Sansa, who has her sister Arya Stark slit his throat, exacting justice for Jon.[8]
            Originally it was intended that Jon Arryn's death in King's Landing would open the series, following the depiction of the book's prologue, and the event would be discussed by Grand Maester Pycelle and Queen Cersei Lannister in a new scene not in the books. This scene was not filmed for the pilot episode in favor of retaining the opening of the novel. Jon Arryn was played in these scenes by John Standing.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Arryn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJonArryn</string></dict>
        <key>Caleotte</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.271.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Caleotte was a member of the Order of Maesters, and was in service to House Martell at the Water Gardens.
            Caleotte delivers a raven scroll bearing news of Princess Myrcella Baratheon's death to Doran Martell. Ellaria Sand chooses this moment to assassinate Doran, and stabs him in the chest. Obviously having not been part of the Sands' coup, Caleotte attempts to flee. For her own amusement, Tyene Sand throws a dagger, which could have been tinted with the Long Farewell, into the maester's back, killing him.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Maester Caleotte attends to Prince Doran at Sunspear, and travels with him whenever he vacations at the Water Gardens. He is long accustomed to treating Doran's gout, and designed the wheelchair that he uses.
            His appearance in the show partly resembles his description in the books, having a shaven head, smooth cheeks, and wearing dun colored robes. Unlike in the show, he is fat, has soft pink hands and is no more than five feet tall.
            Maester Caleotte serves also as Doran's advisor. After hearing Obara's plan of revenge, Caleotte suggests it may not be prudent to allow Obara to return to Sunspear, because she is certain to inflame the common people. Doran agrees with the maester and returns to Sunspear, where he orders to arrest the Sand Snakes, to prevent them from stirring troubles.
            Maester Caleotte takes precautions to protect his prince: after Doran caresses Tyene's head, Caleotte examines his palm, looking for scratches that may indicate poisoning.
            Following the near-fatal attempt on Myrcella by Ser Gerold "Darkstar" Dayne, Maester Caleotte saves her life but cannot heal her disfigured face.
            Maester Caleotte is present when SerÂ Balon SwannÂ presents theÂ skull of Gregor CleganeÂ to Doran, EllariaÂ and the Sand Snakes.
            So far in the books, he is alive.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Caleotte</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascCaleotte</string></dict>
        <key>Ethan Forrester</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.272.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Ethan Forrester was the third-born son of Lord Gregor Forrester.
            He is drawn to pursuits of the mind, particularly music and books. Ethan and his twin sister Talia both shared a great love for the towering trees of Ironrath. He was young when his house joined the War of the Five Kings, and the end of the war placed him into a role which he was unprepared for.[1]
            Ethan was once tormented by a miller's boy, and while his mother wanted to intervene, his father wanted him to fight his own battles. His brother Asher, however, had none of it and grabbed the miller's boy by his neck and knocked half of his teeth out. Gregor was furious, but all Asher cared about was his little brother.[2]
            After his father is killed and oldest brother Rodrik Forrester is presumed dead during the events of the Red Wedding, young Ethan officially becomes the new head of House Forrester, (though it is assumed he was still the acting Lord throughout the course of the war. It could also have been Duncan Tuttle, the castelan, and Lady Forrester), when House Bolton is enforcing its new Lannister-backed rule of the North. Ethan succeeds despite being the third son because second son Asher Forrester was exiled some years before.[2]
            Ethan is first seen playing in the ironwood grove with his siblings Talia and Ryon. He is hiding from the two behind tree. Talia scans the area and remarks that if he was smart he would reveal himself, while Ryon states he doesn't like the game anymore because they can't find Ethan. His hiding spot is revealed, and he comforts Ryon. Ryon begins to speak about everyone who he misses, his siblings and Gared Tuttle, who was recently sent to the Wall.
            They discuss Gared's fate, and how Ser Royland Degore was worried about him because he believes Ethan can't fight well, and called him a milksop. Talia recommends that Ethan let him teach him how to fight, as he taught Rodrik, Asher, and even herself how to fight. Ryon agrees, believing a lord should know how to fight.
            Talia begins to reminisce about how Rodrik, Asher, Ethan, and her used to play in the grove for hours, but Rodrik became serious and Asher became angry. She asks Ethan to not be like that, but be the way he already is. Ethan can promise not to change or state that he may have to.
            Ser Royland calls out, stating that Ethan is need in the great hall immediately, as Lord Ludd Whitehill has arrived unannounced and unexpectedly. His siblings beg him to stay, and even if the player chooses to stay in the grove, Ethan goes to the meeting.
            Duncan Tuttle and Ser Royland brief Ethan. Royland wishes to be decisive and firm, ordering him to leave and not give him any satisfaction, while Duncan wishes him not to provoke the Whitehills. Lord Whitehill and his men enter. Lord Whitehill begins giving him condolences for his late father and brother, although they weren't his friends. He raises his hands to be shaken, which Ethan can do, ignore it, or thank him. Regardless, the rival lord proclaims that his only regard that he wasn't there to drive the dagger into his heart himself.
            Ludd announces that the Forresters finally got their due. Ethan responds to this, before Ludd rants on how the house received him with no bread and salt. Ethan also answers this, possibly angering him even more. Royland and Lord Whitehill share a glare before Duncan reminds Ethan that he's losing control. Ethan redirects Ludd's attention back to himself, and asks why exactly he's here.
            A Whitehill man-at-arms, Britt Warrick comes forward and explains his encounter with Gared, stating how they were attacked for no reason. When Ludd asks how Ethan answers for his men, Ludd is angered further, he questions on the whereabouts of Gared. After hearing what has happened Lord Whitehill, angrily proclaims he's not leaving until he gets his justice, and unless they bring the coward who did it they'll answer to Roose Bolton. Ethan's mother, Lady Elissa Forrester intervenes, calming Ludd. He apologizes, but turns back to Ethan, proclaiming it's not over. Ethan declares it's over, and Elissa reminds that Ethan is Lord of Ironrath and that his word is law there. Ludd reminds him that Lord Bolton will have the final say, asserting that he will tell Roose that a Forrester man killed one of his own, and that the new Lord Forrester lied to his face and denied him his justice before leaving.
            After the Whitehills leave, Royland either remarks that he was wrong about Ethan and he stood up to him like a true lord, or Duncan will remark that Ethan acted wise. Lady Forrester adds that he was brave, but he'll need to be braver when Ramsay Snow, comes to see him bend the knee.
            Later, in one of the wooden towers of Ironrath, Maester Ortengryn follows him disclosing that he is young and there are those that are uncertain of his leadership, but relates that three hundred generations of Forrester lords stand behind him, and speaks of his ancestors, such as Gerhard the Tall, the founder of the house and his grandfather Thorren the Bold, who seized back the river valley from the Whitehills. Ethan asks about his father, who Ortengryn affirms will be known as Gregor the Good.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ethan_Forrester</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascEthanForrester</string></dict>
        <key>Yezzan zo Qaggaz</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.273.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Yezzan zo Qaggaz is a slave trader from the city of Yunkai, on the coast of Slaver's Bay.
            Yezzan zo Qaggaz is a member of the House of Qaggaz and a slaver who purchases and trains pit fighters. He owns one of the lesser fighting pits.
            Besides the Valyrian dialect of Slaver's Bay, Yezzan also speaks the Common Tongue of Westeros.
            Yezzan is present at an impromptu slave auction of Malko's. He purchases Jorah Mormont for use in the recently reopened fighting pits. When Tyrion Lannister demands to be bought as well, Yezzan is uninterested in Tyrion's claims that he and Jorah are a team. He changes his mind when Tyrion savagely beats the slaver holding his chain, and pays for him, agreeing with Malko's assertion that Tyrion is "funny". When Tyrion suggests that he and Jorah be paid for their labor to avoid the Queen's ire for practicing slavery, Yezzan hits Tyrion and tosses him a single coin, teasing that should last the rest of his life. Later, at one of the "lower" pits, Yezzan addresses his fighters and announces that those who survive the day will fight at the Great Pit of Daznak. Yezzan is shocked to see that Daenerys Targaryen and Hizdahr zo Loraq themselves are present and hastily has his gladiators dedicate their kills to her. Yezzan is later knocked down by Jorah, who emerged from the dungeon early in a desperate attempt to reach the Queen.[1]
            Later, he is still at the pit observing two of his warriors when Jorah returns from Meereen. Wondering why he didn't just leave, Jorah then asks Yezzan to allow him to fight in the pit in front of the queen, and if he wins Yezzan will be allowed to sell Jorah.[2]
            At the diplomatic negotiations with Tyrion Lannister in Meereen, Yezzan returns to represent Astapor, whose slave-masters were reconstituted by Yunkai. He quickly recognizes Tyrion as the dwarf slave and remarks that he has literally climbed to the top of the Great Pyramid. The slaving cities offer Daenerys and her supporters a pot of gold to sail away from Slaver's Bay. However, Tyrion proposes a counter-offer that slavery be phased out over a seven-year period and that all slave masters be compensated. He leaves them to decide his offer.[3] The slaving cities later attack Meereen with a large fleet.[4] When time comes to discuss terms of surrender, Yezzan represents the slavers along with Razdal mo Eraz and Belicho Paenymion; he puts forward the slavers' terms that Daenerys and her allies are to quit Meereen, save Missandei and the Unsullied who are to be resold, and Rhaegal and Viserion are to be destroyed. When Daenerys, Drogon and Grey Worm turn the tables on the slavers, Missandei announces that one of the masters must die as punishment for their disobedience. Razdal and Belicho scapegoat Yezzan, citing his low birth, but Grey Worm chooses to cut Razdal's and Belicho's throats instead. Yezzan is sent home with a warning for Astapor - the consequences of opposing Daenerys are dire.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Yezzan zo Qaggaz is a Yunkish Wise Master. He has yellow eyes and is morbidly obese to the point that he can no longer stand, hence his derogatory nickname "the yellow whale". He contracted a jungle disease while on a slaving raid in Sothoryos which he has been suffering from for years: he cannot hold his water so he always smells of urine, which even perfume cannot hide. He wears yellow silk tokars with gold fringe. He is obsessed with the grotesque and often purchases slaves with physical deformities to add to his "collection". While overweight he is still shrewd and intelligent, a trait some of the other Wise Masters don't share. He is rumored to be the the richest man in Yunkai.
            Despite his personal grotesqueness, it is remarked that Yezzan isn't that bad compared to some of the other slavers, and isn't particularly cruel. So long as his slaves obey Yezzan treats them relatively well, and makes sure that they are well fed and looked after (though this is in the same sense that a man will make sure that the horses he owns are well fed and are not beaten, because he doesn't want to needlessly damage his own valuable property). Unlike him, however, his slave overseer, Nurse, tends to be cruel and harsh towards his master's slaves.
            Yezzan is also one of the few Wise Masters who urge that Yunkai should try to make peace with Daenerys, fearing that further conflict with her Unsullied army and increasingly large dragons is more trouble than it is worth, and perhaps also because he is not naturally cruel. He objects to those who want to assault Meereen, and also to the sellsword Bloodbeard's proposition to return the Meereenese hostages (Daario, Hero and Jhogo) by catapulting them into the city.
            Yezzan is not involved in pit fights. There is a Meereenese crone called Zahrina that purchases cheap slaves to fight in the arenas, "meat" to be slaughtered by the more formidable fighters.
            Yezzan purchases Tyrion and his dwarf companion Penny for entertainment. Tyrion notices that Zahrina is about to purchase Jorah, and he persuades Nurse to buy Jorah too, claiming that he is part of their show. Tyrion and Penny comply to their new master and are treated correctly. Jorah, however, does not cooperate, and as a result is treated very brutally by Nurse: he is locked in a cage and beaten severely every evening.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Yezzan_zo_Qaggaz</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascYezzanzoQaggaz</string></dict>

            Ser Imry Florent is a member of House Florent of Brightwater Keep, a noble house sworn to House Tyrell of the Reach. However, due to his sister Selyse's marriage to Stannis, the Florents declare for Stannis in the War of the Five Kings.
            Ser Imry accompanies Stannis aboard the King's flagship, the Fury. After much of Stannis' fleet is destroyed with wildfire, Stannis orders his forces to disembark. Ser Imry warns Stannis that hundreds will die trying to reach the shore. The King replies that it will actually be thousands, but is the first to climb down to a ferry boat.[1]
            As the King's flagship was not engulfed in wildfire during the battle, his whereabouts are unknown.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Imry Florent, like the rest of House Florent, declares for Stannis after the death of Renly Baratheon. He's given command of Stannis' fleet as Lord High Captain and leads it blindly into Blackwater RushÂ instead of sending scouts like Ser Davos advised.

        <key>Yoren</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.275.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Yoren was a recruiter for the Night's Watch.
            Yoren is a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, in which he serves as a recruiter. He was forced to join the Watch after murdering his brother's killer, Willem, with an axe. Yoren's job is to serve as a "Wandering Crow", an officer of the Night's Watch who travels theÂ Seven Kingdoms searching for fresh recruits, either volunteers or criminals that choose a lifetime on the Wall over punishments such as death or mutilation.[1]
            Tyrion Lannister befriends Yoren at Castle Black, enjoying the fact that the brother of the Night's WatchÂ has a sense of humor, unlike most of his comrades. They talk about what the strangest thing they've ever eaten is;Â Tyrion asks if Dornish women count. Yoren considers Benjen Stark as a close friend and ally and sees him off when he departs on a ranging beyond the Wall. He agrees to travel with Tyrion on the Kingsroad back to King's Landing to pick up more recruits from the city dungeons.[2] He is present when Commander Mormont asks Tyrion to use his connections to intercede on behalf of the Night's Watch for more and better quality recruits and funds to rebuild.
            Yoren and Tyrion arrive at Winterfell, and Robb says pointedly that any man of the Night's Watch is welcome as a guest (making it clear that Tyrion is not welcome). After Tyrion gives Bran the plans for a new saddle Robb changes his mind, but Tyrion says he would prefer the brothel in town. On the road south, he is still travelling with Tyrion when they reach the Crossroads Inn, where he witnesses Tyrion being taken into custody by Catelyn Stark.[3] Yoren rides with all speed to the Red Keep, where he finds Ned Stark and is introduced to Arya. After Jory takes Arya from the room Yoren is able to warn Eddard Stark about his wife's actions before they become public. Eddard agrees to let Yoren comb the city dungeons for fresh recruits for the watch.[4] When Eddard is confronted with his wife's actions he then takes the blame, saying she acted on his orders, leading to confrontations with Robert Baratheon and Jaime Lannister.
            Eddard is arrested for treason when he questions the legitimacy of the king's successor, Joffrey Baratheon. Lord StarkÂ is brought to the Great Sept of Baelor to stand trial and Arya watches from the square. To see over the heads of the crowd, she climbs onto the pedestal of Baelor's statue. When Eddard is brought out he spots her. Then as Eddard is pulled through the crowd, he goes past Yoren and manages to point her out to Yoren by head jerk and saying "Baelor" hoping that Yoren will recognize her and wishing him to protect Arya. Despite a confession,Â Eddard is unexpectedly executed on Joffrey's orders.[5]
            Yoren grabs Arya as she is trying to rush to her father. She is pushing her way through the crowd trying to draw her sword. He holds her still, covers her ears, and keeps her from witnessing the beheading by blocking her view. Once out of the square he cuts Arya's hair with a knife and instructs her to pose as a boy. He intends to take her north to Winterfell and safety, hiding her among a group of 20 recruits for the Night's Watch. He instructs her to go by the name Arry the orphan boy, because no one cares or asks questions of orphans. Yoren warns her not to trust the other recruits, as any of them could turn her in for a reward, or rape her.[6]
            Yoren takes the recruits along the Kingsroad into the Riverlands. He warns the rest of the party to stay away from the three prisoners caged in the wagon. Two gold cloaks find the party camped in the Riverlands, and are there requesting for a bastard name Gendry. Yoren blatantly ignores their requests despite the cloaks providing royal warrants, stating that all his recruits now belong to the Night's Watch. The lead gold cloak moves to draw his sword but is halted when Yoren places the point of his dagger against his femoral artery. Yoren notes that men worry about their throats but often forget about the vulnerability of their lower regions. Yoren takes the man's sword, saying that good steel is always needed on the Wall. Yoren tells the gold cloak that he has a choice; die there or return to King's Landing and tell his master that they did not find what they were looking for. The gold cloak defiantly shouts that they are looking for Gendry and describes the bull's head helmet that he carries. He offers a reward to anyone turning him over and promises that he will return with more men.[7]
            Later, Arya sits up cleaning Needle while the rest of the recruits sleep. Yoren enters the room, sits down and inquires what is troubling her. She asks him how he sleeps with the terrible things that he has seen. He notes that she should not be worried about that as he made sure she did not see her father's execution. She says that she cannot forget seeing the Queen, Joffrey, and Sansa standing next to her father on the podium. In response, Yoren tells her about the murder of his brother by a boy named Willem. He says that he thought constantly about revenge and eventually made it a ritual to say the killer's name before falling asleep. When Willem returned to town, Yoren killed him with an axe and then took his horse to ride to the Wall and join the Night's Watch to avoid prosecution. Taking Yoren's method into consideration, the two are interrupted by horns sounding outside. Yoren wakes his recruits and marshals them for a fight. He warns Arya and Gendry to stay out of sight and flee north if the fight is lost. With everyone fleeing outside, Lommy picks up Gendry's bull helm.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Yoren</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascYoren</string></dict>
        <key>Illyrio Mopatis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.276.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Illyrio Mopatis is a Magister of Pentos and a supporter of House Targaryen.
            Illyrio is a merchant-prince and a Magister of the Free City of Pentos, located across the Narrow Sea to the east of Westeros. Immensely rich and powerful, Illyrio is an ally and benefactor to Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen. He lives in a great manse in the city, guarded by Unsullied.
            Illyrio brokers the deal to "sell" Daenerys in marriage to Khal Drogo of the Dothraki. Drogo desires an exotic wife from far away and Viserys needs a Dothraki army to help retake the Seven Kingdoms, so a bargain is made. Illyrio is present when Daenerys says that she doesn't want to marry him. Viserys says she will, and that he would let Drogo's men and all their horses rape herÂ if it meant that in return he could get an army to help him retake the Iron Throne.Â When Drogo comes to approve of Daenerys, he rides up to the steps, looks her over, and then rides off. Viserys is concerned as Drogo had not said a word nor had he even dismounted. However, Illyrio assures him that if Drogo had not approved, he would have made it known.
            Illyrio hosts the wedding and gifts Daenerys with three dragon eggs, turned to stone by the passing of ages. He introduces them to Ser Jorah Mormont, a Westorosi lord in exile and a spy for Varys who then takes service with Viserys.[1] Khal Drogo immediately leaves with his khalasar for Vaes Dothrak, to present Daenerys before the dosh khaleen, and see if the omens are right for war. Ser Jorah tells Viserys that he should stay at Magister Illyrio's estate, as he has been invited to do, until after Khal Drogo returns from the sacred city, but Viserys says he will stay with the khalasar until he gets his army.
            Some months later, Illyrio pays a secret visit to King's Landing where he discusses their mutual plans with his ally, Varys, the Spymaster at King Robert's small council. Varys informs him of how the new Hand of the King, Eddard Stark, now has the same genealogy book that his predecessor read, and has met Robert's bastard son Gendry; the same evidence which led Jon Arryn to discover the truth about Queen Cersei's children. Illyrio suggests the possibility that the same fate may befall Lord Stark as did his predecessor, but Varys states Eddard Stark is not the same man as Arryn was. Furthermore, he assures Illyrio that the conflict between the Lannisters and the Starks will soon escalate into a civil war. Illyrio protests that a war will not serve their purpose right now, since Khal Drogo is not yet ready to send his army of Dothraki to invade Westeros for Viserys, thus reviving the Targaryen Dynasty. However, Varys protests there is no way of delaying the incoming conflict, so the Dothraki must be urged to move faster, since "this is no longer a game for two players." Illyrio replies that it never was. Their discussion is overheard by Arya Stark, who is with them in the tunnels under the Red Keep. Arya tries to warn her father about what she heard, but she doesn't know who the speakers were and out of context all she understood was that her father "has found the bastard", that "the wolves are fighting the lions", and "something about the savage." Despite their secret conversation, later at a small council meeting Varys seemingly supports King Robert's proposal to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen because of the threat her pregnancy and the possibility of a son poses. This information was presumably brought to Varys by Illyrio, who placed Jorah Mormont with the Targaryens and visited Varys on the same day Varys brought this information to the small council.[2]
            The Spice King, a Qartheen merchant, is acquainted with Illyrio, considering him a shrewd man.[3]
            After crossing the Narrow Sea, Varys and Tyrion Lannister have settled at Illyrio's home in Pentos, and Varys reveals he is a colleague of Illyrio, both from a group of people seeking a Targaryen restoration.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Illyrio is a morbidly obese, middle-aged man who dresses in rich finery. He favors using money and power to overcome problems rather than honor and valor. He is described as morbidly obese, with yellow hair and a forked beard.
            Illyrio was married twice: his first wife was the daughter of a cousin of theÂ Prince of Pentos.Â After their marriage ended (it is not specified whether Illyrio's wife died or left him), he took aÂ LyseneÂ pillowhouse worker namedÂ Serra as one of his bedwarmers,Â fell in love and married her, although he knew that would upset the Prince. The Prince was indeed angry, and barred the palace to him forever after, but in Illyrio's eyes it was a small price for Serra. Illyrio was very happy with her, until aÂ Braavosi trading galleyÂ brought the grey plague (a virulent sickness which is swifter than theÂ greyscale) to Pentos. Serra was one of the 2,000 victims. Illyrio cherishes her memory, and has not been married for a third time.
            In the second novel, Illyrio dispatches a former pit-fighter called "Strong" Belwas along with the aged squire Arstan Whitebeard - actually a disguised Barristan Selmy - to Qarth to protect Daenerys.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Illyrio_Mopatis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascIllyrioMopatis</string></dict>
        <key>Jon Connington</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.277.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>During Robert's Rebellion he was tasked with capturing Robert Baratheon at the Stoney Sept. Connington insisted on engaging Robert in single combat and his army was defeated when Eddard Stark arrived to aid Robert with reinforcements, resulting in the Battle of the Bells, in which the crown was defeated.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jon Connington was the only surviving son of Armond Connington, Lord of Griffin's Roost, and his wife. He served as a squire in King's Landing along with Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. He was the most headstrong amongst the gaggle of young lordlings who would gather around Prince Rhaegar competing for his royal favor. He danced with Ashara Dayne at the Tourney at Harrenhal and was unhorsed at a tourney held at Storm's End by Ser Barristan Selmy.
            Due to his connections with the royal family, and because he was a noted warrior, Jon was chosen by King Aerys II as Hand of the King after the dismissal of Owen Merryweather. Aerys wanted someone young and vigorous to match the rebelling Robert Baratheon. When word of the kingâs choice reached Tywin Lannister he declared that the Handship had come to soon for Connington as he was too young, too bold and too eager for glory. Because the traditional lords of the Stormlands, House Baratheon, were in rebellion to the crown, Jon Connington was possibly titled Lord of Storm's End, although that castle was still held by Stannis Baratheon during the rebellion.
            After the Battle of Ashford, Connington took over the pursuit of Robert from the Tyrell army. In the Riverlands, near the town of Stoney Sept, he caught up with Robert, who was hiding in the town. Jon's soldiers began a house-to-house search after failing to find him, but they did not locate Robert before his allies arrived at Stoney Sept to oust Connington and his forces. At this point the Battle of the Bells began. The rebel army under the joint command of Lords Eddard Stark, Jon Arryn and Hoster Tully immediately began attacking the royal army. Jon Connington fought back fiercely, personally killing Jon Arryn's nephew and heir, Denys Arryn, and wounding Lord Tully. It was thought that Robert would have killed Jon, but in spite of the determination of both men to find each other in the chaos, they never crossed swords. When Connington saw that the battle was lost, he managed to escape and was able to retreat in good order. Jon's retreat was quite a feat considering the fierce, urban fighting would have made it hard to hold the army together.
            King Aerys II held Jon responsible for this defeat and exiled him, stripping him of his lands, wealth and titles. Many of Connington's detractors stated he could have ended the rebellion in a single stroke by burning Stoney Sept to the ground, killing Robert before his allies arrived to rescue him but didn't because he wanted the glory of slaying Robert in single combat. Others pointed out that if Connington burned Stoney Sept to the ground, but Robert still managed to escape, it would have severely shamed the royal side in the war, and more lords would have gone over to the rebels in protest. Griffin's Roost was rewarded to Jon's cousin, Ronald Connington - who went over to the rebellion after the Battle of the Trident. After the war, most of House Connington's lands were distributed to more fervent supporters of the new king, Robert Baratheon, and the stripped of lordship, reducing the head of the family to the title of "Knight of Griffin's Roost". Once on the Iron Throne Robert was not willing to recall Lord Jon from exile, since he had been among Prince Rhaegar's closest friends.
            He lived out the remainder of his days as a sellsword in the Golden Company and it is reported that he drank himself to death in Lys after stealing from the company's coffers.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Connington</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJonConnington</string></dict>
        <key>Yohn Royce</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.278.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Yohn Royce, also known as "Bronze Yohn", is the Lord of Runestone and a powerful bannerman of House Arryn.
            Yohn Royce is the Lord ofÂ Runestone and the head of House Royce, a vassal of House Arryn. He is the father ofÂ Ser Robar Royce, who served in the Kingsguard of King Renly I Baratheon, and Ser Waymar Royce, a rangerÂ in theÂ Night's Watch who was one of the first brothers of the Night's Watch to be killed by a White Walker upon their return.
            When Eddard Stark was a ward to Lord Jon Arryn and lived at the Eyrie in his youth, he and Yohn Royce became close friends and hunted together many times.
            While escorting his son Waymar to the Wall, Yohn Royce visited Winterfell.
            Yohn Royce is present in the tribunal, hearing the testimony of LordÂ Petyr BaelishÂ about the death ofÂ Lysa Arryn. Along with Lady Anya Waynwood and Ser Vance Corbray, he assumes foul play on Littlefinger's part. He openly expresses his dislike of Littlefinger, calling him a whoremonger, money-grubber, and liar, as well as pointing out his tendency to suck up to Tywin Lannister in the past. The tribunal then summons Littlefinger's niece, "Alayne", the only other witness. Lord Yohn is surprised to learn of Alayne's true identity - Sansa Stark. Satisfied with her testimony, Royce and Waynwood discuss the Vale's next move with Baelish. He suggests that it is long past time that Robin left the Eyrie and conducted an official tour of the Vale.[1]
            Royce agreed with Petyr Baelish to foster Lord Robin Arryn at Runestone, although he is not impressed with the skills of the young lord.[2]
            Royce oversees Robin Arryn's archery training, watching in contempt as Robin fails to hit the marks. The training is interrupted when Baelish arrives by carriage. Royce is outraged as Baelish told him that he and Sansa Stark would return to the Fingers, yet Sansa was married to Ramsay Bolton at Winterfell. Baelish uses the opportunity, falsely claiming that on the way to the Fingers they were attacked by a vast Bolton host which seemed to have inside knowledge of Baelish's travel plans. Baelish reveals that Royce was the only one he told about his route and begins casting aspersions on his loyalty, asking Robin how to fare with him. Although Robin at first plans to throw Royce out of the Moon Door, Baelish advises him to spare Royce because of his loyalty to House Arryn. With the dark realization that Robin is under Baelish's control, Royce pleads with Robin for another chance, and Robin agrees. Royce is named commander of the armies of the Vale and told to round up the Vale's soldiers in order to march North and save Sansa from Ramsay.[3]
            The Vale reinforcements win a crushing victory against the Bolton infantry, slaughtering the phalanx surrounding the depleted Stark forces and allowing Jon Snow to liberate Winterfell with a wildling force.[4] Lord Royce later voices to Jon his disgust at the knights of the Vale allying themselves with "wildling invaders". Tormund Giantsbane explains that they were invited, but Lord Royce responds that he was not the one who invited them. He later watches on as Lady Lyanna Mormont, Lord Wyman Manderly, and Lord Robett Glover proclaim their allegiance to Jon Snow as the new King in the North, and declares allegiance to the new King in the North alongside the other lords of the Vale.[5]
            Royce is present at King Snow's meeting regarding plans against the White Walkers' impending invasion. He opines that Last Hearth and Karhold ought to be totally demolished in retribution for House Karstark and House Umber's treason against House Stark. However, Sansa and Jon disagree with this and Jon ultimately allows Ned Umber and Alys Karstark to retain their ancestral homes after renewing their pledge of loyalty.[6]
            Royce speaks out against Jon's plan to treat with Daenerys Targaryen, on the basis that "a Targaryen cannot be trusted" unaware of Jon's own true parentage.[7]
            Yohn is ordered by SansaÂ to see that the armor made for their armies are outfitted with leather to keep warm.[8]
            Later, Lord Royce joins Lord Robett Glover in calling for Regent Sansa to take over from her half-brother Jon Snow as ruler of the North. Sansa rejects their petition and insists that Jon is their true ruler and that she is only a regent. Arya Stark suggests that Sansa assassinate the troublesome lords but Sansa rejects the idea as repugnant.[9]
            Lord Royce is later present at what is ostensibly a drumhead trial for Arya Stark. Royce is clearly not surprised or displeased that the trial turns out to be Littlefinger's instead. Sansa confronts Littlefinger with his countless crimes against the Starks, Arryns, Tullys, and many others who have suffered from the massive war he discreetly started. When Petyr demands that Lord Yohn escort him back to the Eyrie, Royce scornfully refuses, signaling that he no longer recognizes his authority. He later watches impassionately as Lord Baelish is executed by Arya Stark, ending Littlefinger's machinations once and for all.[10]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lord Yohn Royce is described as having a lined face and grey hair, grey eyes and very bushy eyebrows. However, he still looks immensely strong as he is tall and has large, gnarled hands. He has a set of bronze armor, thousands of years old that is inscribed with runes that are said to ward him from harm, hence his nickname "Bronze Yohn". He has three sons: Andar, Robar and Waymar (the latter two are dead), and one daughter Ysilla.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Yohn_Royce</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascYohnRoyce</string></dict>

        <key>Jojen Reed</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.281.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jojen Reed was the son of Lord Howland Reed and younger brother of Meera Reed. A Greenseer, he accompanied his sister, Bran Stark, Rickon Stark, Osha, Hodor and Stark direwolves Summer and Shaggydog on a journey beyond the Wall to find the Three-Eyed Raven, believing Bran to be instrumental in the oncoming war against the White Walkers.
            Jojen is the younger brother of Meera Reed and is the eldest son and heir of Lord Howland Reed of Greywater Watch.
            Bran Stark, Rickon Stark, Osha, Hodor, Summer, and Shaggydog are fleeing to Castle Black following the Sack of Winterfell[1] when Jojen first appears to Bran in a dream. Later he walks up to him while he is alone in the forest saying that he and his sister have been searching for him for a long time so that they can protect him.Â OshaÂ surprisesÂ JojenÂ by putting a spear to the back of his neck, butÂ OshaÂ releases him whenÂ MeeraÂ suddenly appears with a knife toÂ Osha'sÂ neck.Â Osha warns Jojen that Summer will protect Bran, should MeeraÂ harm him but Summer sniffs Jojen's hand and walks on.Â Jojen and Bran bond as they discuss their fathers when Jojen recalls that he has traveled in his mind to witness Robert's Rebellion in his dreams. Jojen gives cryptic information about Bran's powers as a warg. Osha grows increasingly resentful of Jojen.[2]
            Jojen and Bran share a greensight dream where Bran climbs a tree to follow a three-eyed raven, although Bran falls after Catelyn Stark appears repeating her warning in which she made him promise never to climb again - a promise Bran broke. Bran and Jojen wake in their camp in the woods, disappointed that he could not follow the Three-Eyed Raven.[3]
            Jojen Reed has another vision which appears as a seizure. Jojen then tells Bran that in his vision he saw Jon Snow surrounded by enemies.[4]
            After seeking shelter in a derelict windmill during a rainstorm, the group notices a band of wildlings chasing down an old man. The sounds of thunder terrify Hodor, who shouts out in panic. Fearing discovery, Jojen tells Bran to silence Hodor, who keeps panicking. Bran unintentionally uses his Warg powers to render Hodor unconscious. With the wildlings still outside, Jojen convinces Bran to Warg through Summer and Shaggydog outside, who then maul to death some of the wildlings. While in control of Summer and Shaggydog, Bran sees Jon Snow outside fighting the wildlings. After this, Bran insists that he must go beyond the Wall to find the raven. However, he wants Rickon to be safe, so heÂ tells Osha to take his brotherÂ with her to the holdfast of Greatjon Umber, a loyal bannerman of the Starks. Bran bids a tearful Rickon farewell, who leaves with Osha and Shaggydog, while Bran continues northward with Hodor, Summer and the Reed siblings.[5]
            At last, the group make it to the Wall and stay overnight in the Nightfort, an abandoned castle on the Wall that is rumored to be haunted. During the night, Jon Snow's fellow Night's Watch comrade Samwell Tarly, with Gilly and her child, emerge from a secret passageway. Samwell, noticing the gigantic Hodor and Summer, realizes who Bran is and offers to take them to Castle Black, but Jojen tells Sam that they are going beyond the Wall, as no force in the realm of Westeros could withstand the threat posed by the White Walkers. Sam reluctantly shows them the secret sally port and gives them the dragonglass daggers found at the Fist of the First Men, which he earlier used to slay a White Walker. That night, Bran, the Reeds, Hodor and Summer finally pass beyond the Wall.[6]
            When Bran becomes obsessed with warging Summer, Jojen is forced to warn him of the dangers that perhaps Bran will be trapped by his own powers. He emphasises that they need Bran to survive. Heading further North, Jojen helps Bran find a heart tree. Bran touches the tree, triggering his greensight, showing him a larger heart tree where they must go to find the Three-Eyed Raven.[7]
            Later, Bran and his companionsÂ are resting near Craster's Keep. They hear the faint sounds of a baby's cries. Bran enters the mind of Summer to investigate where he finds Ghost, the direwolf ofÂ Jon Snow. However, before he can free Ghost, Summer is caught by a trap. At Meera'sÂ urgings, they go to rescue Summer and Ghost but are taken prisoner byÂ Karl. While Hodor is being tormented byÂ RastÂ and the other mutineers for pure amusement, Karl threatens to kill Jojen and Meera before Bran gives up his identity.[7]
            JojenÂ and the others are being held imprisoned in a tent. Karl enters the tent and ties upÂ MeeraÂ and prepares to rape and torture her. Jojen begs for mercy and offers to help them, saying he possessesÂ the sight. Karl refuses and just before he cuts Meera, Jon Snow and members of theÂ Night's WatchÂ attack the keep.Â Locke, who really servesÂ Roose Bolton, searches for Bran and finds him and attempts to escape the keep with Bran. However, JojenÂ signals Bran toÂ wargÂ into Hodor, allowing him to save his own body throughÂ Hodor's.

        <key>Drogo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.282.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Drogo was a chieftain of a Dothraki khalasar and is often referred to by his title, Khal Drogo.
            Drogo is a khal or warlord of the Dothraki, the famed nomadic horse-lords of the eastern continent beyond the Narrow Sea. The Dothraki are fierce warriors, skilled in battle, unrelenting in combat and known for savagery towards non-Dothraki. Amongst their own people they have a code of honor, albeit still a harsh and unforgiving one. Drogo was very young to have his own khalasar, particularly such a large one. He is a legendary warrior and has never been defeated in battle.[1] Drogo desired the most beautiful and exotic woman in the world as his khaleesi or wife, and enlisted Magister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos to help him find such a woman.[2]
            He is guarded by bloodriders including Qotho.[2] Generals or ko in his khalasar include Pono and Jhaqo, men who guard him, follow him in battle and, when Drogo dies, it is their duty and honor to follow him even then to continue serving him.[3]
            Illyrio and Prince Viserys Targaryen arrange the marriage of Viserys's sister Daenerys to Khal Drogo in return for Drogo supplying Dothraki troops to support Viserys's play for the Iron Throne of Westeros. Drogo agrees, but does not stipulate a time frame. Viserys notes the length of Drogo's braid: Dothraki have to cut off their hair when they are defeated, but Drogo's long hair suggests that he has never been defeated in battle. Viserys states that Drogo is a "savage" but also "one of the finest killers alive."[2]
            Drogo marries Daenerys outside the Free City of Pentos, but is unable to communicate with his new wife due to them not sharing a language. Drogo only appears to understand the word "No," which he repeats often. Ser Jorah Mormont, a Westerosi knight who has Drogo's favor, aids with translation. As a wedding gift, Illyrio gives Daenerys three dragon eggs that have turned to stone due to the passage of time. Drogo gives Daenerys a beautiful white horse. When Daenerys wishes to thank Drogo for his gift, Ser Jorah tells here that there is no word for "thank you" in her new husband's language, a reminder of how unpleasant the Dothraki can be. Drogo is determined to consummate their marriage immediately, which Daenerys finds uncomfortable and frightening.[2] Attempting to make her time with Drogo more bearable, Daenerys begins learning the Dothraki language from her handmaid IrriÂ andÂ seeks advice from another handmaid, Doreah, on how to best please him in bed while establishing her own power over him using her sexuality, which culminates in a closer relationship. Combining these skills, Drogo comes to respect her as an equal.[4] After two months, Daenerys and Drogo are happier together. Drogo expresses satisfaction and joy at the news that Daenerys is with child, and that she thinks it will be a boy.[5]
            In King's Landing, King Robert Baratheon's spymaster, Varys, is working with Illyrio in planning the Dothraki invasion of the Seven Kingdoms. However, Drogo is content to wait until his son is born before planning the assault. Varys thinks the situation in Westeros will unravel much more quickly than they anticipated and urges Illyrio to get Drogo to speed up his timetable.[6]
            In Vaes Dothrak, the sacred city of the Dothraki, Drogo is pleased when the Dosh khaleen prophesy that his son will be the 'Stallion Who Mounts the World', a prophesied khal of khals who will command the largest khalasar ever seen and lead the Dothraki to dominion over all the lands of the world. He also approves of Dany naming himÂ Rhaego after her slain brother, Rhaegar, a great warrior defeated in battle by "the usurper" Robert Baratheon. However, a drunken and aggressive Viserys petulantly demands that Drogo took Daenerys but never provided the army he promised. Believing he will not be harmed because shedding blood in the sacred city is forbidden, Viserys draws his sword and threatens that unless he is given his army immediately, he will take back his sister, but leave the child, saying he will cut it out and leave for it Drogo. Furious, but careful to control his emotions for the sake of Daenerys and their child, Drogo agrees to give Viserys "a golden crown that men shall tremble to behold." Not understanding the language, Viserys believes he is finally getting what he wants, and lowers his guard, allowing two of Drogo's bloodriders to disarm and restrain him. Drogo melts a gold belt in a pot, then "crowns" Viserys with the molten gold, killing him.[7]
            Daenerys asks Drogo to continue with the invasion, but with his obligation to Viserys gone, Drogo is reluctant to attempt to cross the Narrow Sea because of his people's fear of the "poison water" (the sea, which the Dothraki fear, because they distrust any liquid that a horse will not drink) and "wooden horses" (ships). Ser Jorah later saves Daenerys from an assassin sent by King Robert. Learning of the attempt, Drogo rewards Jorah with any horse he desires from Drogo's own herd. Drogo swears a blood oath that he will punish Westeros for their attempt on the life of his wife and child, lead the Dothraki beyond the poison water to invade the Seven Kingdoms and seat his son on the "Iron Chair" of Westeros.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Drogo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDrogo</string></dict>
        <key>Donnel Waynwood</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.283.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Donnel Waynwood is a knight of House Waynwood and serves House Arryn as the Knight of the Gate, commander of the Bloody Gate.
            Ser Donnel is a son of Lady Anya Waynwood, the current head of House Waynwood.
            Ser Donnel is at the Gate when Lord Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark arrive. Littlefinger introduces Sansa as his niece, Alayne. Donnel believes him and lets them pass.[1]
            When Sandor Clegane and AryaÂ StarkÂ reaches the Bloody Gate and DonnelÂ orders them to stop, Sandor tells him who they are expecting ransom for reuniting Arya with her auntÂ Lysa Arryn. After DonnelÂ explains that Lysa died three days ago, Sandor is left in shock while Arya bursts out in laughter, because of the irony.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Donnel Waynwood is described as being a stocky man of twenty, with a wide nose and thick brown hair. Donnel is the second of Lady Anya's three sons: Morton, Donnel, and Wallace. HeÂ serves at the Bloody Gate and leads the sortie that saves Catelyn Stark and her retinue from the Mountain clans at the Mountains of the Moon. After Ser Brynden Tully departs with his niece Catelyn, Donnel later replaces him as the new Knight of the Gate.
            Later at the Bloody Gate, Lady Anya introduces her grandson Ser Roland Waynwood, a muscular man about 25 years old, as well as her youngest son Wallace, who is identified as Roland's uncle. It isn't clear if Roland is Morton's son or Donnel's son.

        <key>Donnel Hill</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.284.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Donnel Hillâ was a member of the Night's Watch.
            Donnel Hill is a bastard from the Westerlands. It is unknown which noble house he hailed from.
            During theÂ Battle of Castle Black, Donnel takes part in defending the Wall against Mance Rayder 's forces. He helps load the barrels onto the ramps. WhenÂ Castle Black's inner gate is threatened by the giant Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg, he accompanies Grenn, Cooper, and three other black brothers to defend it. They successfully kill the giant, but all of the black brothers are slain in the process. Their bodies are discovered by Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly after the battle.[1]
            After the arrival ofÂ Stannis Baratheon and his forces, though not seen Donnel is among the numerous bodies of fallen black brothers burned in Castle Black's courtyard.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Donnel Hill, nicknamed "Sweet Donnel Hill", isÂ a steward of the Night's Watch and the squire of Ser Mallador Locke. He claims to be a bastard of House Lannister.
            While the ranging force camps at the Fist of the First Men, Donnel is among the brothers who plot to murder Jeor Mormont, Sam and other prominent brothers to end the Great Ranging and desert. The sudden snowfall and the attack of the Others foils the plan. However, during the Mutiny at Craster's Keep DonnelÂ sides with those who are loyal to Mormont. He and the other Loyalists make it to Castle Black long before Jon and Sam.
            Donnel survives the Battle of Castle Black. He is not one of the brothers who go with the blacksmith Donal Noye to protect the gate, thus he is not killed by the giant Mag.
            Donnel is one of the four brothers who, at Jon's command, shoot arrows at Mance Rayder (actually, it is Lord of Bones in disguise) while he is executed by burning, in order to grant him a quick and painless death.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Donnel_Hill</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDonnelHill</string></dict>
        <key>Dontos Hollard</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.285.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Dontos Hollard, also known as Ser Dontos the Red, was a knight of House Hollard. He is made a fool by King Joffrey Baratheon after attending a tourney drunk.
            Ser Dontos is a knightÂ and the only surviving member of House Hollard.
            Dontos enlists in the tournament to celebrate King Joffrey Baratheon's namedayÂ and is set to fight Lothor Brune. When his bout is announced, he emerges half-armored and drops his helmet. He apologizes, and Joffrey accuses him of drunkenness. Dontos denies the accusation but admits to drinking two cups of wine. Joffrey offers Dontos as much wine as he likes, and Dontos accepts. Joffrey orders Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard to ensure that Dontos "drinks his fill." Trant and two of his sworn brothers hold Dontos down and pour wine into his mouth through a funnel. Sansa Stark cries out âYou can't!â Joffrey is incensed, but she claims that she meant it would be bad luck for Joffrey to kill someone on his nameday. Joffrey is dismissive of this superstition until the Hound backs Sansa. Joffrey reluctantly orders Dontos to be imprisoned until the following day, planning to execute him then and calling him a fool. In an effort to spare Dontos from execution, Sansa says that Joffrey was clever to notice Dontos' foolishness and entreats him to prolong his suffering by making him the court fool , stating that he didn't deserve the quick death of a knight.[1]
            Dontos is present at court, in his fool's regalia, when Joffrey orders Sansa publicly beaten for her brother Robb Stark's victory in the Battle of Oxcross. She is rescued partway through by the intervention of actingÂ Hand of the King Tyrion Lannister.[2]
            During the Battle of the Blackwater, Dontos is present at Maegor's Holdfast. He juggles to entertain some of the highborn ladies refuged there.[3]
            Dontos follows Sansa to the Red Keep's godswood, where he thanks her for saving his life duringÂ Joffrey's nameday celebration. As a gesture of his appreciation, he gives Sansa a necklace strung with sevenÂ amethysts, which he tells her is a family heirloom worn by his mother and grandmother. Sansa tells him she will wear it with pride.[4]
            Dontos performs at the feast following the wedding of Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell. Bored with his performance, Joffrey offers a gold dragon to the person who knocks Dontos' hat off, resulting in Dontos being pelted with objects from all directions. Later, when everyone is distracted byÂ Joffrey's fatal poisoning, Dontos approaches Sansa, convincing her to leave in order to save her life. Unlike the rest of those present, Dontos is neither shocked nor horrified.[5]
            The confusion from Joffrey's death gives Dontos and Sansa just enough time to flee the feast. Soon after Tyrion is seized for Joffrey's assassination, Queen Cersei orders Sansa arrested as well, only to find Sansa is nowhere to be found. Hand of the King Tywin Lannister orders that no one be allowed to leave King's Landing. Despite this, Dontos and Sansa are able to make their way through abandoned alleys virtualy unseen, coming upon a small row boat. Dontos rows the two to a fog-shrouded ship and has Sansa board. On board is Petyr Baelish, who reveals to Sansa that the "family heirloom" that Dontos gave her was a fake and that Dontos rescued Sansa expecting payment from Baelish. Baelish double-crosses Dontos, "paying" him by ordering his death by crossbow, reasoning that he was a drunkard and would talk eventually.[6]
            At Tyrion's trial, Pycelle testifies that Dontos' body was found, with the necklace Sansa wore at the wedding, and that a residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Dontos is the only surviving member of House Hollard. The Hollards were close allies and vassals of House Darklyn of Duskendale. When the Lord of Duskendale rebelled against the Mad King in the Defiance of Duskendale, the Hollards joined them. After Aerys II had been held prisoner by the Darklyns for several months and then rescued by Ser Barristan Selmy, he had the Darklyns and most of their vassals executed in a variety of grisly ways. Ser Barristan asked for clemency for the infant Dontos, which Aerys granted. Dontos was taken back to King's Landing and raised as a squire, eventually earning his knighthood.
            Some time after Sansa saves Dontos' life, he leaves her a note asking to meet him at the Godswood. Sansa suspects a trap but goes anyway. Dontos thanks Sansa for saving him and promises to help her escape, comparing them to the tale of Florian - a knight who became a fool - and Jonquil, his love. Sansa is impatient and wants to escape immediately, but Dontos says they have to wait until the time is right. They meet occasionally at the Godswood, and Dontos becomes Sansa's confidant. It is Dontos who tells Sansa that the Lannisters won the Battle of the Blackwater.
            At one occasion when Joffrey orders his guards to abuse Sansa, Dontos volunteers to. He whacks Sansa's head with a "morningstar" whose head is a melon while shouting "Traitor, traitor," much to the amusement of the spectators. Sansa understands why he does this: he beats her feebly, trying to make it look very humiliating for her, in hopes of sparing her a much worse beating. As the melon juice runs down her face and clothes, she prays that this will be enough entertaining for Joffrey. However, Joffrey is not satisfied, and orders Meryn Trant and Boros Blount to beat Sansa up. She is saved by Tyrion.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dontos_Hollard</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDontosHollard</string></dict>
        <key>Doran Martell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.286.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Prince Doran Martell was the head of House Martell, the ruling Prince of Dorne, and the Lord of Sunspear. He was the older brother of Elia and Oberyn Martell, and the father of Trystane Martell.
            He was murdered along with his heir, Trystane, by Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes in an act of retaliation for his inaction against House Lannister for their crimes against Dorne.
            Doran Martell was the Prince of Dorne and the Lord of Sunspear. He was the head of House Martell, the ruling house of Dorne, and the older brother of the late Princess Elia, who was murdered along with her children, Rhaenys and Aegon, by Ser Gregor Clegane in the Sack of King's Landing, and PrinceÂ Oberyn, known as The Red Viper, also killed by Clegane.
            He suffered from a severe case of gout, which mostly prevented him from walking and restricted him to a wheelchair.[1]
            Unlike his more hotheaded and aggressive brother, Oberyn, Doran was a pensive, calculating, and patient man who always waited and observed before making his next move. Despite their different personalities, the two brothers were very close. While Oberyn could indulge in the wayward Dornish ways, challenging whomever he liked regardless of the consequences, Doran was raised to be more responsible as the heir to the Dornish throne. He truly cared for both his people and his family, and would never make a decision that would go against their interests. However, this was often against their wishes, and this resulted in his becoming an unpopular ruler.
            Doran had also been a witness to war and was deeply marked by its consequences. As such, he often tried to find a solution that avoided waging war, even if the honor of House Martell had been offended. This, along with his physical weakness, gave some people the impression that he was weak-willed and easily dominated, but this was misleading; Doran was just as ruthless and decisive as any other member of House Martell. He was simply better at hiding it - until the moment that he struck.[2]
            Tyrion Lannister, the actingÂ Hand of the King, proposes a marriage alliance to Prince Doran, offering the hand of Princess Myrcella Baratheon to be wedded to Doran's son when both come of age. Queen Cersei Lannister resists the idea, insisting her daughter would be a political hostage under House Martell, who notoriously hate the Lannisters.[3] However, when Prince Doran accepts the alliance, Myrcella is sent to Dorne as a ward of his House.[4]
            Prince Doran is expected to arrive at King's Landing for the Royal Wedding. Due to his poor health, however, his younger brother Oberyn travels to the capital instead.[5]
            DuringÂ Joffrey and Margaery's wedding,Â Tywin LannisterÂ inquires after Prince Doran's health, revealing that he suffers from gout and is unable to walk.Â OberynÂ reassures Tywin that his brother is fine.[1]
            Prince Doran is overlooking the Water Gardens with Captain Areo Hotah when Ellaria Sand approaches him. Angered, she berates Doran for simply doing nothing when he learned how Oberyn was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane. Doran reminds her that Oberyn died fighting in a trial by combat, which by law is not considered murder. Doran intends to bury and mourn his brother, but Ellaria and Oberyn's daughters want Dorne to take up arms and avenge Oberyn. She also wants to harm Myrcella Baratheon in order to send Cersei Lannister a message. Doran reassures Ellaria that, as Oberyn's paramour, he will always love her, but he strictly forbids her from harming Myrcella while he rules. Ellaria doubts that Doran will remain in power if he continues to do nothing, and then storms off. Hotah and the Prince exchange a look as she departs, the former meaningfully indicating his axe, but Doran shakes his head and returns his attention to the Water Gardens.[6]
            Doran watches with Areo as Myrcella and Trystane take another walk through the Water Gardens. The prince comments that their betrothal is dangerous as their Houses hate each other and they needed to be protected from those who would harm them. He asks Areo if he remembers how to use his longaxe, as it has been a long time that he hasn't used it. Areo reassures him that he remembers how to use it.
            Jaime Lannister later arrives at the Water Gardens and tries to take Myrcella but is stopped by the Sand Snakes who also try to take Myrcella for their own ends. As Nymeria tries to take Myrcella, Areo arrives with the Prince's guard and arrests them all on Doran's orders. Ellaria is also arrested for leading the Sand Snakes.[7]
            Once Ellaria leaves, Jaime asks about his companion, Bronn. Doran asks what they would do to a commoner who struck a prince in King's Landing. Jaime takes the blame, claiming that Bronn had only been following his orders. Doran defers to Trystane to decide Bronn's punishment. Trystane agrees to release Bronn but requests that Areo slap him as he had been slapped, to his father's approval.
            Doran, Ellaria, and the Sand Snakes are present for Princess Myrcella's departure for King's Landing with Jaime, Bronn, and Trystane. He bids her farewell, and gives Ellaria a nod, allowing her to give Cersei's daughter a kiss, though she has coated her lips with a fatal poison. Myrcella dies from the poison, though only after their boat has left the shore, while Doran remains unaware that Ellaria betrayed him again.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Doran_Martell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDoranMartell</string></dict>

            Drennan is a crewman of the Sea Bitch, the ship Theon's father Balon Greyjoy gave him to raid the Stony Shore. Theon used an attack on Torrhen's Square as a diversion to drain forces from Winterfell. Drennan then takes part in the seizing of Winterfell by Theon Greyjoy. When the people of the castle are brought together in the courtyard for Bran Stark to officially surrender to Theon, Drennan is behind the kennelmaster Farlen. Farlen yells insults at Theon and Drennan hits him over the head with a club.[1]
            Afterwards, he's assigned guard duty. During the night, Osha seduces Drennan and slits his throat, allowing Bran and Rickon Stark to escape Winterfell alongside Hodor, Summer and Shaggydog and Osha herself.[2]
            Drennan's body is discovered and brought into the courtyard the following day. After angering Theon, Lorren gets beaten by the Prince of WinterfellÂ next to Drennan's corpse.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Drennan is one of Theon's men. When Winterfell was taken, he and another man named Squint rape Palla, the daughter of Farlen. Theon orders them whipped to show the people of Winterfell that he will treat them fairly as their new lord. To ease the escape of Bran, Rickon, Hodor, Summer and Shaggydog, Osha comes to him with a plate of food. He is found slumped over a table, with his pants around his ankles and his throat cut with his own knife.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Drennan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDrennan</string></dict>

            Dongo is one of the non-human race of giants who joined the Free Folk army assembled by Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall.
            While approaching the camp of the Free Folk in Skirling Pass, Jon Snow witnesses this giant building a tent from the bones and tusks of a mammoth. As Jon stares at the giant in disbelief, Ygritte warns him that giants are shy, but quick to anger and tells him how she once witnessed a giant smash a man into the ground like a hammer to a nail. This giant catches Jon gawking at him and grunts in annoyance. [1]
            During the Battle of Castle Black Dongo emerges from the Haunted Forest holding a bow with the other members of Mance Rayder's army. He escorts Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg and his mammoth to the outer gate of the Wall. While a wildling bowman fails to reach the black brothers on top of the wall with his arrow, this giant crouches next to him, pulls a massive bow out and shoots a ballistaÂ bolt at the wall, wreaking havoc on their defenses. His next arrow hits a brother with such force it causes him to fly off the other side of the wall and land in the middle of Castle Black.
            When Jon leaves Castle Black to kill Mance Rayder, Jon walks past Dongo's corpse, which has crows picking at its flesh.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mance RayderÂ uses giants for breaching the tunnels at the Wall. However, none of the giants wield bows during the Battle of Castle Black. The most complex weapons that the giants seem capable of wielding are clubs and simple mauls.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dongo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDongo</string></dict>
        <key>Duncan Tuttle</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.289.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Duncan Tuttle is the Castellan of Ironrath, and the uncle of Gared Tuttle.
            As a boy, Duncan showed such talent for managing his familyâs farm that everyone assumed heâd one day inherit it. But Duncan was fated to run more than fields and a pigpen.Â One day, while supplicating at Ironrath, he struck up an unlikely friendship with Gregor Forrester, the heir to House Forrester. The two grew close, sharing food, drink, and women; when Gregor became lord he named Duncan his castellan. Many eyebrows were raised, but Duncan proved himself worthy and has served the House well in the many years since.
            Duncan is first seen when he runs to his nephew Gared and is informed his family is dead. He is also seen arguing with Ser Royland with what to do about what happened on Gared's farm. He keeps disagreeing with Ser Royland and doesn't want House Forrester to be blamed for protecting Gared because of the death of a Bolton and Whitehill soldier, so he decides to send him to The Wall for his protection.
            Later on he is outside with Gared discussing how Lord Forrester's best men worked at the wall, he then informs Duncan "The North Grove can never be lost", he describes how some people think it's made up by wildlings and fools and is better kept that way, he also says the North Grove may very be vital to the future of House Forrester. His last lines in this chapter are to Gared when he says to him "Iron From Ice", Gared does the same.
            Duncan is seen yet again when Ser Royland and Lord Ethan Forrester come into the Great Hall when he says Lord WhitehillÂ is demanding retribution for his soldiers and he knows Gared is a squire to House Forrester. Ser Royland says that they have to stand up to Lord Whitehill, while Duncan says they can't anger Lord Whitehill anymore than he already is. Duncan is quiet for the most part when Lord Whitehill arrives, not until he mentions the Ironwood the Whitehills stole. After the discussion it is possible for him to say Ethan was calm or if Ethan was silent, he says to him he needs to find his voice. Either way Elissa Forrester tells the three to prepare a raven for Mira in King's Landing.
            Duncan later witnesses the punishment of Erik, a Forrester man-at-arms who attempted to desert. He recommends that Ethan shows mercy, and suggests that he is sent to the Wall. Following Ethan's decision, Ortengryn recommends Duncan as a candidate for Sentinel. Ethan can then talk to Duncan, who will inform him that Ironrath's food stores are running low. He can also ask Duncan for advice on choosing a Sentinel. Duncan claims that he would be the better choice, respectfully dismissing Ser Royland. Talia will also recommend Duncan to Ethan.
            Ethan then calls a small council meeting, where he selects his Sentinel. If Royland is chosen, Duncan will be angered, saying that he is reckless and foolish and that Ethan is too young to be Lord. If Duncan is chosen, he promises not to disappoint Ethan.
            As they devise a plan to deal with Ramsay Snow, Duncan advocates for diplomacy, saying that they should negotiate with him and invite him into the Great Hall. If Ethan agrees with his suggestions but did not choose him as Sentinel, Duncan will talk with him after the meeting and advise him not to be indecisive.
            If Duncan was not made Sentinel, he is not present at the meeting with Ramsay Snow, which Royland will angrily note. If he is Sentinel, he stands by Ethan's side while Royland is absent. Duncan fights for Ethan during the talks with Ramsay, supporting his argument that the Whitehills will destroy the ironwood forests should they be given control of them. When Ramsay stabs Ethan, Duncan attempts to rush to his aid, but is restrained by Whitehill soldiers as his Lord bleeds out.
            Duncan accompanies Lady Elissa Forrester to see her son,Â Rodrik, after he is returned to IronrathÂ some time after the Red Wedding with grave injuries. If RodrikÂ refused Maester Ortengryn's request to drink the milk of the poppy, Duncan comments on his stubbornness shortly before the lord passes out.

According to legend, Durran won the love of Elenei, daughter of the sea god and the wind goddess, and took her as his wife.
            In rage, the gods sent a storm to destroy his keep over Shipbreaker Bay, killing his family and guests. Declaring war against them, Durran built new castles, each larger and more formidable than the previous one, though all were the destroyed by the divine storms. Finally, the seventh castle, which Durran built with the aid of either the Children of the Forest or a very young Bran the Builder, withstood the rage of the gods and became known as Storm's End, while Durran earned the nickname of "Durran's Godsgrief" and ruled as the first Storm King.[1][2]
            Durran's dynasty, House Durrandon, perished with the death of Argilac Durrandon. However, House Baratheon descends from it through its female bloodline.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire books Durran's story remains the same.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Durran</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDurran</string></dict>
        <key>High Sparrow</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.291.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The "High Sparrow" was the leader of the religious sect known as the Sparrows and the newly appointed High Septon. Under his tenure as High Septon, the Faith Militant was reestablished, and the Faith amasses considerable influence over the Iron Throne during the reign of King Tommen I. His real name is unknown. The High Sparrow was immensely serious, threatening, and only occasionally tender.
            The man who would become the High Sparrow was born to a fairly well off cobbler. After his father's passing, the young Sparrow continued and greatly improved the family business. Many highborn citizens sought out his wares and were happy to pay hefty sums. In turn, the man took extreme pride in his work, often spending night and day crafting a pair of shoes. The Sparrow became ever richer and adopted an extravagant lifestyle. He sought to distance himself from his humble roots and thus began to mimic the nobility who bought from him. The soon to be septon was known for giving lavish parties that ended in debauchery. After one such night with too much wine and women, the Sparrow woke up at the crack of dawn. Ashamed of what he had devolved into, the Sparrow up and left his life, not even bothering to put on his shoes. He began to minister to the less fortunate because he now felt they were closer to the Seven than anyone.
            He became a humble septon out in the countryside who began to preach equality among all men and aid the poor while leading a humble life himself, often denouncing the excesses and sins of the nobility. He and his followers began to speak out against the suffering inflicted on the smallfolk by the feuding noble families in the War of the Five Kings. As followers gathered around him, he made his way to King's Landing.
            He emerged as more or less the leader of the religious protest movement known as "the Sparrows", and his critics started mockingly calling him the "High Sparrow" - in sarcastic comparison to the High Septon, the highest cleric and ordained leader of the Faith of the Seven. His followers, however, adopted the nickname in pride, and  started calling him "the High Sparrow" themselves as a sign of respect. He never tried to call himself this, but the name stuck.[1] After being made High Septon, as per tradition it became forbidden to ever refer to him by his given name again, so whatever his original name was remains unknown.[2]
            Although the High Sparrow seems a harmless old man, he has a will of steel. Though his devotion to the Seven is genuine, he is also a deeply ambitious man, seeking to obtain political power in order to enforce what he sees as the will of the Gods on the populace, whether they want to or not.
            In the aftermath of her father's murder, Queen Cersei Lannister seeks him out and discovers the High Sparrow is a humble man, serving soup and bread to the poor while barefoot. He finds the name "High Sparrow" humorous and makes no effort to hide what action the Sparrows took against the High Septon, though he admits they could have been more careful. Cersei tells him that he will not be arrested or executed, but the High Septon has been imprisoned instead, which surprises the High Sparrow.[1]
            Through Queen Cersei's influence, the High Sparrow is elected High Septon. To further gain his support, Cersei has Tommen sign a decree restoring the Faith Militant, a military order under the command of the High Septon with the right to bear arms and dispense justice, for the first time since the reign of King Maegor Targaryen.[3]
            The High Sparrow later presides over the inquest into the charges of sodomy, and blasphemy against Loras Tyrell. He also questions Margaery Tyrell and Olyvar on the charges. Olyvar's testimony convinces the High Septon to bring Loras to a full trial, and also to arrest Margaery for perjury and blasphemy, as she swore before the gods that her (false) testimony was true.[4]
            Whilst scrubbing the floors of the Great Sept, the High Sparrow is approached by Olenna Tyrell. After exchanging some barbs and pleasantries the pair discuss Loras and Margaery's arrests. The Queen Of Thorns wants her grandchildren released immediately, but the High Sparrow refuses arguing that the divine laws should apply to both high-and lowborn.
            Olenna resorts to offering him a bribe, and when this fails she threatens to have House Tyrell cease supplying the realm with their crops. Unimpressed, the High Sparrow challenges the Tyrell matriarch, asking if she ever performed any labor in the field. He adds that the smallfolk are many while the nobility are few, and asks what will happen when the many stop fearing the few. He then turns around and leaves her.[5]
            Later, the High Sparrow receives Cersei, who has come to the Great Sept to see the imprisonment arrangements of Queen Margaery, at the lowest and oldest level of the Great Sept - a simple stone sept withÂ none of the grandÂ adornments of the Great Sept that Baelor the Blessed built on top of it. He tells her ofÂ the limited known history of the chapel, making plain his love of the simplicity in how it represents pure faith and compares it unfavorably to the grandiosity of the Great Sept.Â He uses this comparison to showÂ how the highborn, like the Tyrells,Â can be stripped back to reveal the pureÂ truth beneath their facadeÂ and then openly wonders and asksÂ what they will find of Cersei once they strip back her finery to reveal the truth beneath. He then tells her ofÂ a highbornÂ young man who has already stripped himself in this fashion,Â and adds that he hadÂ much to say of her.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/High_Sparrow</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHighSparrow</string></dict>

        <key>Joffrey Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.295.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Joffrey I Baratheon was the second Baratheon king to sit on the Iron Throne.  Though believed by most to be the eldest son of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, Joffrey is actually a bastard born from Cersei's incestuous relationship with her twin brother, Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard. He is the older brother of Myrcella Baratheon and Tommen Baratheon, both of whom share the same parentage.
            Joffrey is believed to be the oldest son and heir of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, both of whom entered into aÂ political marriage alliance after Robert took the throne by force from the "Mad King," Aerys II Targaryen. In reality, his father is Jaime Lannister, the queen's brother and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.[3] His sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins.
            Joffrey takes after his mother in terms of looks and personality, his blond hair being a subtle clue that he isn't really a Baratheon, who famously always possess black hair even when only one parent is Baratheon. Cersei herself lets it slip to Catelyn Stark that she once had a child with black hair who died prematurely before she had Joffrey.[4] He is usually accompanied by his sworn shield, the formidable Sandor Clegane, better known as the Hound. Even before he ascends to the Iron Throne,Â Joffrey is spoiled, arrogant, cowardly, and sadistic, though he tends to hide them before his ascension. These traits are further exacerbated upon Robert's death and his ascension to the crown.[5]
            Prince Joffrey accompanies his parents to Winterfell and is betrothed to marry Sansa Stark as part of King Robert's plan uniteÂ House Baratheon to House Stark by blood. Both seem happy with the prospect, and Joffrey is charming and polite towards Sansa.[6]
            When King Robert Baratheon is grievously wounded in a hunting accident, he talks to Joffrey on his death bed and says he could have been a better father.
            Joffrey ascends to the Iron Throne, and orders that preparations be made to crown him within the fortnight. Eddard refuses to recognize Joffrey's claim to the Iron Throne. He presents a proclamation from Robert making him Regent and Protector of the Realm to enforce his authority, but Cersei tears up the document. Eddard expects Lord Petyr Baelish and Commander Janos Slynt of the City Watch to take Cersei and Joffrey prisoner, but is betrayed. Eddard is taken into custody and his remaining guards and household are murdered.[9]
            Sansa is taken captive as well, but Arya manages to escape into the city thanks to her dancing teacher Syrio Forel. Influenced by his mother, Joffrey dismisses Ser Barristan Selmy from the Kingsguard and names his "uncle" Jaime as the new Lord Commander. Barristan is shocked, as the Kingsguard are sworn to serve for life, and it is legally impossible to dismiss one of their members. Ser Barristan is further insulted by members of the royal court and draws his sword, but after a tense moment throws it at the foot of the Iron Throne and contemptuously tells the 'boy' to melt it down and add it to the rest.
            Days later, Joffrey holds court. Marillion sings a song he wrote about King Robert and Queen Cersei, which includes lyrics saying that the boar may have disemboweled Robert, but the "lion in his bed" (theÂ Lannister'sÂ sigil is a lion) was the one who tore his balls off.Â Joffrey is displeased by the song and its insults against his parents. He forces the minstrel to choose between having his hands or tongue removed, then orders Ser Ilyn to instantly carry out the order, ripping out his tongue in front of the entire horrified court. Joffrey and his guards escort Sansa out of the courtroom and he states to her that she will be kept captive there and will still marry him; he also casually mentions that his mother said he should "put a son in you" as soon as Sansa has had her blood. They arrive at the castle's wall, where there are several heads mounted on long spikes - one is revealed to be Ned's. When Sansa is appalled, Joffrey angrily points to another spike carrying the head of Septa Mordane, revealing that he also needlessly killed Sansa's own Septa.
            She confronts him about his promise to show mercy to her father, but he says it was mercy, as he gave him a quick death. Then Joffrey forces her to look at the severed heads, and he says that he will give her Robb's head on a spike as well if he were to be defeated by the Lannisters, prompting her to reply: "Or maybe he'll give me yours."
            Joffrey is infuriated, but restrains himself from striking her as he says "Mother tells me a king should never strike his lady" - so he simply calls on Ser Meryn Trant to strike her for him, and the knight slaps Sansa hard across the face twice. Sansa comes up behind Joffrey on the walkway, obviously thinking of pushing him, though it would mean her death. The Hound realizes this and stops her, under the pretense of wiping the blood off her lip.[12]
            Joffrey rules with cruelty and arrogant whims, while his grandfather Tywin Lannister fights in the War of the Five Kings to secure his hold of the Iron Throne.[13] Joffrey celebrates his nameday with a tourney and continues to torment the captive Sansa Stark, also naming Ser Dontos Hollard as his new fool as punishment for showing up drunk (although would have had him executed if not for Sansa's intervention, whose claim that it is bad luck to execute a man on one's nameday was supported by the Hound).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJoffreyBaratheon</string></dict>
        <key>Joffrey Velaryon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.296.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Joffrey was the youngest son ofÂ Rhaenyra TargaryenÂ and her first husband/cousin,Â Laenor Velaryon. His mother was the first child and daughter ofÂ Viserys I Targaryen, who did not change the succession of theÂ Iron ThroneÂ upon the birth of his sons. This therefore made Joffrey fourth in line for the throne. When his grandfather died, his uncle was namedÂ Aegon II Targaryen, on the orders of his step-grandmotherÂ Alicent Hightower. When Rhaenyra heard the news, theÂ Dance of the DragonsÂ began. By this time, Laenor had presumably died and Jacaerys' mother had remarried her uncle Daemon Targaryen, and had two sons with him. By the time his mother sat on the Iron Throne, his older brothers had both died at the hands of the Greens, and she was not popular among the Smallfolk, who started to rebel against her. A certain follower of the faith, The Shepherd, declared that the dragons were demons and claimed that that they ruled this world. Pointing to the Dragonpit, he signaled to attack it and kill the dragons. This ended with the death of all four dragons in the pit, including the destruction of it. Joffrey, who watched the violence from the Red Keep, mounted his mother's dragon, Syrax, still thinking that he could save the dragons. However, Syrax did not understand Joffrey's intentions, and in stead of flying to the ruins of the Dragonpit, he moved erratically to be free of him, until he was. Joffrey fell from him, to his death. Mourning for her son, Rhaenyra decided to sail back to Dragonstone, Joffrey's death signaling that Rhaenyra would never succeed as being a peaceful Queen.
            
            
            When he was three years old, his ten year oldÂ dragonlessÂ half-uncle PrinceÂ Aemond TargaryenÂ slapped him in an attempt to claimÂ Vhagar, for himself. Joffrey called for his two older brothers, and in the ensuing fight Aemond lost an eye.
            He was twelve years old at the start of the civil war which became known as theÂ Dance of the Dragons. Joff was ordered to GulltownÂ to defend theÂ Vale of ArrynÂ against KingÂ Aegon II Targaryen's dragons,Â Rhaena TargaryenÂ was chosen to accompany him. ButÂ Grand MaesterÂ MunkunÂ suggests that it wasÂ Jace'sÂ desire to keep his brother as far away from the fighting that was paramount in this decision.Â He was named theÂ Prince of DragonstoneÂ after the death of his eldest brother, Jacaerys, at theÂ battle of the Gullet.
            He died during theÂ storming of the DragonpitÂ trying to rideÂ SyraxÂ in order to save theÂ dragonsÂ in theÂ Dragonpit.

        <key>Dickon Tarly</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.299.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dickon Tarly was the second and favored son of Lord Randyll Tarly and Melessa Tarly. He is the younger brother of Samwell Tarly and Talla Tarly. He became his father's heir after Randyll disinherited Samwell by forcing him to join the Night's Watch under the threat of death. Dickon is fiercely devoted to his family and loyal to his father, regardless of where the path takes him.
            Dickon is athletic, a skilled hunter and excellent swordsman, though not particularly bright and also quite arrogant and condescending. Naturally gifted at martial endeavors, he is his father's favorite child. After Randyll Tarly banishes his older brother Samwell Tarly to the Wall, he designates Dickon as the heir to Horn Hill and the Valyrian steel sword Heartsbane, which has been in the family for five hundred years.
            When Samwell Tarly returns to Horn Hill with his "lover" Gilly and "their child", Little Sam, Dickon and his father Randyll are out hunting. Later at dinner, he is cordial but cool towards his older brother and Gilly. When Sam asks him whether they're eating the deer that he and Randyll hunted, Dickon replies that what they're eating was in fact last week's haul and that they did not have time to cure today's catch. He also engages in dinner table conversation with Sam about hunting beyond the Wall. Sam tells him that there are no deer and elk to hunt, only rabbits.[1]
            After Gilly tells the hosts that Samwell killed a White Walker, Dickon expresses amused disbelief and claims that White Walkers are just a myth. He is present when Randyll tells Sam that he will find work for Gilly as a servant and foster Little Sam as his grandson, but that Samwell is no longer welcome at Horn Hill. Undaunted, Sam takes his "family" away and also steals the family heirloom Heartsbane.[1]
            Dickon attend Cersei Lannister's court of Reachmen, along with his father, who mentions the fact that the Dothraki and Unsullied will attack Westeros during Daenerys Targaryen's invasion. Jaime, wanting to get Randyll on his own, accidentally calls Dickon "Rickon", before privately requesting an audience with Randyll.[2]
            Dickon eventually follows his father's decision to forsake the Tyrells and, together with Randyll, becomes part in the Lannister war efforts against the Tyrells which culminates in the Lannister army conquering Highgarden. During this battle, Randyll functions as a general of the Lannister army, with Dickon by his side.[3]
            On the ride back to King's Landing, Jaime accosts Dickon, again calling him "Rickon". Dickon corrects him, and Bronn laughs at his name, to Dickon's irritation. Jaime inquires how Dickon feels about conquering Highgarden; Dickon initially claims it was glorious, but once Bronn reminds him that Randyll is out of earshot, Dickon shows some regret, saying he knew many of the men there and had hunted with them.
            Despite fighting fiercely, the Westerosi forces are swiftly overwhelmed by the combined cavalry and dragonfire attack, and the battle soon becomes a rout. Dickon saves Jaime from a Dothraki warrior by stabbing the warrior in the back. Jaime nods at him in gratitude.[4]
            After the battle, Dickon and his father are among the prisoners of war lead to Daenerys for an ultimatum. She offers the choice to bend the knee, or be executed. After Randyll refuses, Dickon joins his father in denying her as their Queen, despite both his father and Tyrion protest since his death will mean the near extinction of house Tarly. Daenerys subsequently sentences them to both to death by dragon fire. At her command, Drogon obliges and burns father and son alive despite Tyrion Lannister urging Daenerys to show Dickon and his father mercy by putting them into dark cell to make them change their mind.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Dickon is the fifth child and second son of Randyll Tarly, who was disappointed in his fat and bookish elder son Samwell. Dickon's exact age isn't stated: Samwell is the eldest child, and at least two of their sisters were born before Dickon, meaning that Dickon is at most three years younger than Sam - who is stated to be 15 in the first novel, making Dickon around 12 at that time (though Samwell was aged-up to 18 years old in Season 1 of the TV series, and this might affect Dickon's age as well). He has not appeared yet in the books.
            Randyll tried for years to force Samwell to live up to the Tarly martial tradition but all of his efforts failed. Randyll brought in a dozen masters-at-arms to train him but all failed, and he even tried rituals like having Qartheen warlocks bathe Sam in auroch's blood, but to no avail. As his younger brother Dickon grew up, however, even at the young age of around 8 to 10, he showed the vigor and martial prowess that Samwell lacked, so their father started focusing all of his attentions on Dickon. For a few years Samwell was mercifully ignored and left to his beloved books, but after he turned 15 Randyll realized he would need to take steps to get rid of Samwell (before he reached 16, the legal age of manhood) in order to make Dickon his heir, because he felt Samwell was unworthy of his lands and titles. Randyll therefore threatened Sam that if he didn't "volunteer" to join the Night's Watch, he would kill him while they were out riding, in such a way that it looked like an accident. Dickon's thoughts on all of this are unknown, though he is the son that his father always wanted. Samwell has never mentioned that he overtly blames Dickon for what happened, focusing on that it was their father's decision.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dickon_Tarly</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDickonTarly</string></dict>

            Jacaerys was the eldest son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and her first husband/cousin,Â Laenor Velaryon. His mother was the first child and daughter of Viserys I Targaryen, who did not change the succession of the Iron Throne upon the birth of his sons. This made Jacaerys second in line for the throne.
            When his grandfather King Viserys I Targaryen died, his uncle was named King Aegon II Targaryen, on the orders of his step-grandmother Alicent Hightower. When Rhaenyra heard the news, the Dance of the Dragons began. By this time, Laenor had died and Jacaerys's mother had remarried her uncle Daemon Targaryen, and had two more sons with him. In order to gain more supporters on the mainland of Westeros, Rhaenyra sent him on his dragon, Vermax, to recruit houses in the North and the Vale. House Arryn, the house of Jacaerys's grandmotherÂ Aemma Arryn, were persuaded to join the Blacks. He also persuaded the Starks of Winterfell, meaning that the Northern houses all followed his mother.
            After his grandmotherÂ Rhaenys died at the hands of his two uncles, Rhaenyra sent Jacaerys's younger brothers to Essos for safety but the youngest came back on his dying dragon. Although his mother forbade it, Jacaerys flew on Vermax to rescue his brother from the enemy fleet. However, the dragon dropped into the sea, where they were both shot numerous times, and where it is said, "they soaked up more arrows than seawater."[1]
            
            Jacaerys was fifteen-years-old at the start of the civil war which became known as theÂ Dance of the Dragons. He rode his dragon,Â Vermax, to theÂ Eyrie,Â Sisterton,Â White Harbor, andÂ WinterfellÂ to raise support for his mother's claim. After successfully gaining theÂ Vale of ArrynÂ for theÂ blacks,Â he also gained theÂ NorthÂ through theÂ Pact of Ice and Fire.
            Jacaerys took part in theÂ Battle of the GulletÂ where Vermax flew too low and crashed into the sea. It was said that Jacaerys leapt free and clung to a piece of smoking wreckage for a few heartbeats until some crossbowmen on the nearestÂ ship began loosing quarrels at him. The prince was struck once, and then again. Finally, one quarrel took him in the neck and he was swallowed by the sea.

        <key>Gendry</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.301.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gendry is a skilled blacksmith and an unacknowledged bastard son of King Robert Baratheon. After escaping from the island of Dragonstone with help from Ser Davos Seaworth, he returns to King's Landing, remaining in hiding until Davos returns for him, and accompanies Davos and Jon Snow north in their mission to capture a wight to use as proof at the Parley in King's Landing.
            After the death of Robert, massacre of Robert's other bastards, and the deaths of Robert's brothers Renly, Stannis, and Stannis's daughter Shireen, Gendry is the last known living person of House Baratheon's bloodline.
            Gendry is the last living bastard son of King Robert Baratheon, who throughout his childhood was unaware of his lineage. Gendry did not receive the bastard surname used in the Crownlands (Waters) because, like the rest of his half-siblings, he was not openly acknowledged by Robert.
            Gendry spent his whole life in King's Landing. His mother was a tavern wench that King Robert had sex with once, and apparently Robert never even knew of his existence. Gendry grew up in the slums of Flea Bottom, surviving on bowls of brown stew that contained meat which was allegedly chicken (though he knew full well it wasn't).[1] Gendry's mother died when he was very young. When he was old enough, an unknown lord paid his apprentice fee so he could learn to be a blacksmith. He then took up work as an apprentice blacksmith under Tobho Mott, a master weaponsmith from Qohor, forging high-end armor and weapons for the nobility. Gendry became very skilled in his own right, and the heavy manual labor built him up into a strong young man - ironically, swinging a heavy blacksmith's hammer much as his biological father Robert once swung his war hammer. Gendry worked under Tobho Mott for 10 years.[2]
            Investigating the death of Jon Arryn, Lord Eddard Stark learns that he was seen visiting Tobho Mott's smithy in the city shortly before his death. Eddard also inspects the smithy. Mott tells him that Jon Arryn came to ask about new armor, but he also wanted to talk to the young man, Gendry. Eddard admires a helm that Gendry has made. Mott offers to sell it to him, but Gendry insists that it is not for sale as he made it for himself. Eddard learns that Jon wanted to know about Gendry's mother. He then takes a close look at the boy, and realizes that Gendry is the bastard son of King Robert Baratheon (whom Eddard knew when they were both Gendry's age). Eddard is at a loss as to why Jon Arryn was trying to track down Robert's bastards.[3]
            After King Robert dies, Mott has Gendry leave his smithy, presumably to escape the coming purge of Robert's bastards, though who tipped them off in advance is not stated. Gendry decides to join the Night's Watch, and is one of the latest batch of Yoren's recruits that leave for the Wall. Among the group he meets Lord Eddard's daughter Arya Stark (disguised as the boy "Arry"), when some of the other boys harass her about her sword. When Hot Pie bumps into him, he scares the boys off, saying "When I hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when I hit you?"[4]
            Gendry travels north on the Kingsroad with Yoren and his recruits, befriending Arya on the journey. He is targeted by the City Watch of King's Landing because of his status as a bastard of King Robert Baratheon, but remains unaware of his lineage.[5] Yoren intimidates a pair of goldcloaks who come looking for Gendry into leaving empty handed. Gendry sees through Arya's disguise and recognizes her as a girl. She confides her identity and swears him to secrecy. Gendry is embarrassed for talking so crudely to a highborn member of a noble House, though the tomboyish Arya is herself embarrassed at his deference to her as a "Lady".[6] The goldcloaks return with Ser Amory Lorch and a force of Lannister soldiers. They attack the group and kill Yoren and capture Arya and Gendry. Arya manages to convince them that Lommy Greenhands was Gendry because he was carrying the bull's head helm that Gendry made.[7]
            The prisoners are then taken to Harrenhal. They are brutally tortured by Ser Gregor Clegane's men while being questioned by the Tickler. Gendry is selected as his next victim but is saved when Lord Tywin Lannister arrives and chastises his men that the prisoners are more useful alive. To prove his point, Tywin asks Gendry if he has a trade, and when Gendry says that he is in fact a trained blacksmith, Tywin shoots a stern look at Gregor's men.[8]
            Due to his experience as a blacksmith, Gendry is put to work at the castle's forge.[9] Both the Tickler[9] and Ser Amory are killed in suspicious circumstances.[10] The deaths prompt Tywin to launch an investigation and he ultimately blames the Brotherhood Without Banners.[11] Tywin leaves Harrenhal to lead his army on the march (though rather than heading west to fight Robb Stark, he in fact races back south to fight Stannis in the Battle of the Blackwater). Before they leave, Arya arranges for Jaqen H'ghar to help them to escape the castle.[12] It turns out Arya was right to make their escape attempt then, as when the Lannister army withdrew soon afterwards, it massacred every remaining prisoner at Harrenhal.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gendry</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGendry</string></dict>

            Ser Jaremy Rykker is an officer in the rangers of the Night's Watch and a member of House Rykker. He is acting First Ranger when Benjen Stark is away from the Wall.
            Ser Jaremy attends the induction of new recruits into the Night's Watch. He is the acting first ranger in the absence of Benjen Stark and summons the recruits assigned to the rangers after the Lord Commander's speech. He leads an escort for Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly when they go north of the Wall to take their vows in the Godswood. He embraces his newly sworn brothers after they take their vows. They discover the bodies of rangers Othor and Jafer Flowers near the Godswood and return them to Castle Black. The dead men had accompanied Benjen on his scouting mission beyond the Wall.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Jaremy is an officer in the rangers of the Night's Watch. Ser Jaremy attends the officers meeting with Tyrion Lannister and recalls being sent to the Wall by Tywin Lannister after fighting for House Targaryen in the Sack of King's Landing during Robert's Rebellion. It is Ser Jaremy rather than Ser Alliser who challenges Sam about his decision to take his vows in the Godswood. He is not named as being part of the escort to the Godswood. He identifies the bodies when they are returned to Castle Black.
            Ser Jaremy and four other men were killed by the wight Jafer Flowers. Jaremy managed to hack the wight's head off, but was killed when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels.
            Give that Ser Jaremy is not shown to be killed in the episode, it is possible that he simply wasn't killed in the TV continuity.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jaremy_Rykker</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJaremyRykker</string></dict>

            Lord Gyles attends the Tourney of the Hand and is seated next to Septa Mordane for the first day of the jousts.[1]
            Lord Gyles is present at the session in which Janos Slynt is created Lord Slynt and given the castle of Harrenhal and later Ser Barristan Selmy is dismissed from the Kingsguard. When Sansa Stark appears to ask for mercy for her father, Lord Gyles is greeted by the young lady, though he doesn't answer.[2]
            Lord Gyles is also present at court when the troubadour Marillion is forced to perform a limerick in which he ridiculed the late King Robert and Queen Cersei. Alongside the rest of the courtiers, Lord Gyles claps after King Joffrey begins to clap sarcastically.[3]
            * - uncredited appearance
            In the Song of Ice and Fire novels, Gyles Rosby is the head of House Rosby, a noble house that rules over an eponymous town in the Crownlands. He's noted for being sickly and constantly coughing.
            Lord Gyles is at many major events inclduing the Tourney on King Joffrey's Nameday, riot of King's Landing, Sansa Stark and Tyrion Lannister's wedding, the Battle of the Blackwater, the procession greeting Prince Oberyn Martell and Tywin Lannister's funeral. Cersei appointed him Master of Coin after Tyrion is put on trial for Joffrey's murder. Cersei considers him adequate in the position, but hounding over the crown's debt problems by the Iron Bank of Braavos' envoy exasperates his sickness and he perishes at the Red Keep. Grand Maester Pycelle protests that he did all he could, but an irate and paranoid Cersei accuses him of conspiring with Margaery Tyrell to kill Lord Gyles so a Tyrell can replace him. She orders Pycelle to have all Lord Gylesâs lands and wealth go to Tommen rather than his ward. Cersei selects Ser Harys Swyft as the new Master of Coin.
            According to the semi-canonical A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying Campaign Guide: A Game of Thrones Edition from Green Ronin Publishing Lord Gyles is the father of Lord Walder Frey's sixth wife Bethany Rosby and grandfather of Robb Stark's former squire Olyvar Frey and Lord Edmure Tully's wife Roslin Frey.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gyles_Rosby</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGylesRosby</string></dict>
        <key>Jonos Bracken</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.307.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Jonos Bracken is the Lord of Stone Hedge and head of House Bracken. He is fighting for his liege lord Hoster Tully and King Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings. Prior to Robb's coronation, he proposed joining forces with Renly Baratheon.
            Jonos Bracken is the Lord of Stone Hedge and head of House Bracken, a vassal family of House Tully of Riverrun. He is considered a loyal bannerman to Lord Hoster Tully.
            Kurleket, a man-at-arms sworn to Lord Jonos, is among the men Catelyn Stark summons to help her apprehend Tyrion Lannister at the Inn at the Crossroads.[1]
            Lord Jonos Bracken, having presumably joined Robb Stark's army after the victory at the Battle of the Whispering Wood, advocates joining forces with Renly Baratheon. Robb points out that Renly is the late King Robert's youngest brother and he cannot become king before Stannis. Bracken asks if Robb means to join Stannis instead. Jon Umber then suggests they become independent altogether, and declares Robb as the King in the North. Bracken and the other lords present, even the river lords who have never been ruled from Winterfell, draw their swords and swear fealty to Robb as the King in the North.[2]
            During the War of the Five Kings, Stone Hedge is occupied by Lannister forces. Following the liberation of Riverrun at the Battle of the Camps, Robb Stark tasks one of his commanders, Lord Greatjon Umber, with the expulsion of Lannister forces from the lands of the Riverlords. Umber first liberates Raventree Hall, the ancestral seat of House Blackwood, and then moves to restore Stone Hedge which is then reclaimed by its rightful lord, Jonos Bracken.
            In A Song of Ice and Fire, Jonos Bracken is the ruling lord of House Bracken and its castle, Stone Hedge. He is a loyal bannerman to Lord Hoster. However, he has an enmity towards House Blackwood, part of an old feud going back a thousand years and which continues to cause unrest in the Riverlands.
            Lord Jonos has fathered five daughters: Barbara, Jayne, Catelyn, Bess, and Alysanne, but no trueborn sons, leading some to question his masculinity. Although he claims Harry Rivers - "The Bastard of Bracken" - as his natural born son, there are those who doubt whether Jonos truly sired the boy, as Harry is fair haired and handsome, and Jonos is neither.
            Following the Red Wedding, Lord Jonos is one of the Riverlords who bend their knee to Tywin Lannister,Â and is pardoned for his part in theÂ War of the Five KingsÂ by the Iron Throne. Although the Mountain stole his harvest, burned everything he could not carry off, put Lord Jonos's castle to the torch and raped one of his daughters, Lord Jonos still decides to yield, because "I saw no sense in dying for the dead nor shedding Bracken blood in a lost cause".
            Lord Jonos is persuaded byÂ Tywin to attack Tytos Blackwood's seat,Â Raventree Hall, in return for lands historically claimed byÂ Stone Hedge. Soon he besieges Raventree. The rivalry between Blackwood and Bracken goes back thousands of years so neither side attempts parley. There are skirmishes at the start of the siege, but it develops into a stalemate. Jonos does not bother to build siege machines, preferring instead to starve the Blackwoods out. Half a year passes without any progress. Jonos and his soldiers find entertainments to spend their time, like whoring and drinking.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jonos_Bracken</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJonosBracken</string></dict>

            Ser Jonothor Darry was a renowned knight and a legendary member of the Kingsguard of the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Jonothor Darry's history is the same. Just like most of the other members of the Kingsguard at the time, he too was fiercely loyal to his oaths, fighting for the crown during Robert's Rebellion.
            He was present at the aftermath of the Battle of the Bells to rally the remaining royal forces and later on lead the army of the royalists to the Battle of the Trident, alongside Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince Lewyn Martell and Ser Barristan Selmy. He died at the Trident fighting until the end for his cause.
            Although Jaime Lannister remembers him as a earnest and honorable man, he (like most of his sworn brothers) did nothing against the atrocities committed by the Mad King, not even intervening when the King raped Queen Rhaella. He stated that they were sworn to protect the royal family, except from the King.
            He was the brother of Ser Willem Darry, another Targaryen loyalist, who would later on smuggle the surviving Targaryen children away to the Free Cities.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jonothor_Darry</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJonothorDarry</string></dict>

            According to legend, Joramun gathered the Free Folk to battle the Night's King, who had made the Night's Watch into his personal army. He joined forces with the Stark King of Winter, Brandon the Breaker and together they brought down the Night's King.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Joramun is a legendary King-Beyond-the-Wall who not only fought the Night's King, but also blew the Horn of Winter to wake giants from the earth.
            According to Mance Rayder and Ygritte, the Horn is also capable of bringing the Wall down, but that was never mentioned in the original legend.
            Given that the Night's King was only the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he and Joramun lived relatively soon after the Wall was completed - which may imply that Joramun was the very first King-Beyond-the-Wall, though this has not been confirmed.
            When Jon Snow comes to parley with Mance Rayder (actually to kill him), Mance shows him a huge horn, claiming it is the legendary Horn of Winter. He tells Jon to deliver an ultimatum to Castle Black: unless the wildlings are allowed to pass the Wall within three days, he will blow the horn and destroy the Wall. The horn is destroyed while Mance is executed. However, later Tormund tells Jon that the destroyed horn was a fake; Mance has never found the true horn. There is a theory that the broken warhorn which Sam has in possession is the Horn of Winter, but it has not been verified so far.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Joramun</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJoramun</string></dict>
        <key>Jorah Mormont</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.310.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Jorah Mormont is a formerly exiled Northern lord from Westeros previously living in Essos. He has sworn fealty to his fellow exile Daenerys Targaryen and was the first to help her adapt to life as a Khaleesi of the Dothraki.
            Originally, Jorah was working as a spy for Varys, King Robert's spymaster in King's Landing, sending Varys information about the Targaryen exiles. But he grows to respect and admire Daenerys and begins serving her in earnest. He saves her from an assassination attempt, stops sending reports to Varys and ignores an official royal pardon that would allow him to return home to Westeros. He develops strong and unrequited feelings for her.
            When Daenerys learns of his past spying, he is dismissed from her service and ordered to leave her presence. He later capturesÂ Tyrion LannisterÂ in the hope of winning his way back to her, an endeavor that leads to him contracting the deadly greyscale. After he helps save her life from both the Sons of the Harpy and the Dothraki, Daenerys accepts him back to her service, and orders him to come back to her after he finds a cure to his disease, which he eventually does at the hands of Citadel acolyte Samwell Tarly at Oldtown.
            Jorah Mormont is the son of Jeor Mormont of House Mormont, the Lords of Bear Island and vassals of House Stark in the North. Jorah had a distinguished early career, and participating in the Siege of Pyke during the Greyjoy Rebellion, for which he was knighted by King Robert Baratheon.[1] His father later voluntarily joined the Night's Watch, leaving Jorah as Lord of Bear Island and head of House Mormont.
            Jorah married Lynesse Hightower, but his new wife had expensive tastes that Jorah struggled to fund. Ultimately, he resorted to selling poachers into slavery, which has been illegal in the Seven Kingdoms for millennia and is a great taboo throughout Westeros. Jorah was caught and disgraced. He was stripped of his Lordship and fled to the Free Cities to avoid being executed by Eddard Stark, though he left his family's ancestral sword, Longclaw, behind; his father would eventually pass it on to Jon Snow. He served in mercenary companies such as the Golden Company.[2] His wife eventually left him for another, richer man.[3]
            He is called Jorah the Andal by the Dothraki, as they assume that all people from Westeros are Andals. However, Jorah is actually a Northman, descended from the First Men.
            Besides the Common Tongue of Westeros, Ser Jorah is fluent in the Dothraki language.
            Jorah appears at the wedding of Khal Drogo and Daenerys Targaryen. He introduces himself and presents Daenerys with some books containing songs and stories from Westeros. He tells her that he served her father for many years, and pledges to serve the rightful king, her brother Viserys.[4]
            While traveling to Vaes Dothrak, Ser Jorah tells Viserys that he lost his home because he sold some poachers to slavers (which is illegal in the Seven Kingdoms). Eddard Stark wanted to execute him for breaking the law. He fled instead. Viserys dismisses the charges as foolishness, saying such things will be tolerated under his rule. Mormont is less certain that this will happen.[5]
            Ser Jorah is impressed by Daenerys's growing ability to command. When Viserys tries to hit Daenerys, she is defended by her bodyguard Rakharo, who asks her if she wants Viserys killed. She commands that no harm come to him. Viserys orders Ser Jorah to kill Daenerys' men, a suicidal order that Jorah pointedly ignores; from this point on he is under Daenerys's command. Rakharo orders Viserys's horse taken so he has to walk, a disgrace for a Dothraki.
            Jorah talks to Rakharo and helps him learn some Westerosi words to better serve her. Jorah and Rakharo also swap their opinions on the value of swords and armors versus the arakh and some personal information: Jorah states that his father is a man of great honor and integrity, and that Jorah's disgrace betrayed him. When Jorah learns that Daenerys is pregnant, he rides to the nearby Free City of Qohor.[6] It is later revealed that he sent information to Varys in King's Landing about Daenerys's pregnancy.[7]
            Arriving at Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys asks Jorah if he thinks the Dothraki could retake the Seven Kingdoms for her House. Mormont points out the difficulties of persuading them to cross the Narrow Sea, but believes success would be possible if that could be accomplished and if King Robert was foolish enough to meet them in open battle. He says that if their opponents retreated behind stone walls, the Dothraki would not be able to root them out. They move to discussing Jorah's background and he admits to selling the poachers as slaves to raise money for his expensive wife. When Daenerys asks him where his wife is, Jorah replies that she is with another man in another place.[8]
            In King's Landing, Eddard Stark learns that Jorah Mormont is Varys's agent and spy in Daenerys's retinue. He puts little faith in Jorah's information that Daenerys is pregnant, considering him a traitor who will say anything for a royal pardon. However, King Robert and his council are adamant that his information can be relied on and order the assassination of Daenerys.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jorah_Mormont</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJorahMormont</string></dict>

            During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Lord Jason led the victorious defense of his ancestral seat of Seagard against an attack by the ironborn forces led by Rodrik Greyjoy and killed him.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lord Jason Mallister is a loyal bannerman of House Tully. He has at least one son, Patrek Mallister. As a young knight, he was defeated by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen in a tourney at Storm's End. During the early stage of Robert's Rebellion, he attended the wedding of Eddard Stark and Catelyn Tully, giving them lavish gifts. He participated in the Battle of the Trident, slaying three of Prince Rhaegar's bannermen, thus avenging the death of his kinsman Jeffory Mallister, who had been killed under orders of the Mad King.
            Lord Jason takes part in the Tourney of the Hand and later, during the War of the Five Kings, takes part in the Battle of the Whispering Wood and the liberation of Riverrun at the Battle of the Camps. He returns to Seagard after Robb Stark is declared the King in the North.

        <key>Janos Slynt</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.313.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Janos Slynt was the commander of the City Watch in King's Landing and founder of House Slynt.
            Janos Slynt is the commander of the King's Landing City Watch (also called the "Gold Cloaks"), with almost two thousand men under his command. He is charged with keeping peace and order in the city and quelling unrest.[1]
            Janos reports to the small council about the disruptions to the city caused by the tournament to celebrate Lord Eddard Stark's appointment. Lord Renly Baratheon suggests dismissing Janos in favor of someone more competent, but Janos angrily replies he doesn't have enough resources. Eddard offers him twenty of his household guard and commands Littlefinger to find gold to pay for an expansion of the City Watch by another fifty men.[2]
            After Eddard resolves to expose Joffrey Baratheon's true birth, he asks for the help of the City Watch. Littlefinger agrees to bribe them into supporting Eddard's plan. Janos tells Eddard that they are with him, but is then seen exchanging looks with Queen Cersei. During the confrontation, the City Watch turns on Eddard and kills his men, allowing him to be taken prisoner.[3] Following Lord Stark's arrest, Janos is named the new Lord of Harrenhal and head of House Slynt by King Joffrey, as a reward for his loyalty.[4] He also attends the execution of Lord Stark.
            Lord Janos has been given a place in the small council. During a session that coincides with King Joffrey Baratheon's sixteenth nameday and the official announcement of the end of the longest summer in living memory, he expresses his concern with the influx of refugees fleeing the civil war. He is ordered by Queen Regent Cersei Lannister to bar the city gates to peasants. Later, Janos oversees the massacre of all of the late King Robert Baratheon's bastard children. He personally murders the baby Barra before the eyes of her mother Mhaegen, one of Littlefinger's prostitutes. He also interrogates Tobho Mott, who is being tortured by one of the gold cloaks, about the whereabouts of Gendry and learns that he has left to join the Night's Watch and is heading to Castle Black. Janos sends a small party of men after Gendry.[5]
            Janos is present at a small council meeting when they receive a request for more men from Lord Commander Jeor Mormont of the Night's Watch. Tyrion later has Janos as a dinner guest in the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion dismisses his squire, Podrick Payne, after Janos begins to chastise the boy for spilling wine on his hand. The two exchange compliments and jokes. Tyrion asks about the incident in Petyr's brothel, which Janos calls a nasty business, but necessary. Tyrion feigns agreement, saying that the peace must be kept. However, the discussion quickly turns sour when Tyrion brings up the subject of Janos's role in the murder of Robert's bastards, subtly accusing him of taking bribes from Cersei or Joffrey to carry out such a horrific crime, though Janos defends his position and hints that it was not Cersei who gave him the order. He also defends himself for betraying Eddard to the usurpers, claiming Eddard was a traitor who tried to buy him, though Tyrion counters that Slynt had already been bought by Littlefinger and the Lannisters, and accuses him outright of lacking in honor. At this point, Slynt stands up and threatens Tyrion, but is interrupted by Bronn, whom Tyrion claims is the new Lord Commander of the City Watch. Over Slynt's protests and threats that he has friends at court who will not stand for this, Tyrion has four gold cloaks seize Slynt, informing him that he does not trust him and is sending him to Castle Black to join the Night's Watch. Slynt is dragged from the Red Keep to board a ship bound for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.[6]
            Janos Slynt has arrived at Castle Black along with Ser Alliser Thorne, who has taken temporary command of the castle. He joins Ser Alliser, Maester Aemon and two other black brothers to listen Jon Snow's testimonies (it is unexplained how Slynt was immediately high-ranking enough to join the panel). Slynt is dismissive of Jon's claims, referring to Jon as "the bastard son of a traitor" and argues for his execution. When Jon asks him if he has ever been North of the Wall, he boasts that he commanded the City Watch of King's Landing and grows angered when Jon sarcastically retorts he must have been bad at his job to have been sent to the Wall. Slynt clearly does not believe Jon's report as he laughs at his claims of giants in the Free Folk's army, but is somewhat mollified when he realizes that the other black brothers do.[7]
            Janos warns SerÂ AlliserÂ Thorne that since Snow is popular amongst the Night's Watch, this will give him an edge over himÂ when a new Lord Commander is elected. Slynt suggests sanctioning Jon Snow's expeditionÂ to Craster'sÂ Keep so the mutineers may kill Jon.[8]
            Much to his disappointment, Jon survives and returns to Castle Black. Janos is later present when Jon urges the Night's Watch to seal Castle Black's tunnel because of Mance Rayder's superior forces.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Janos_Slynt</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJanosSlynt</string></dict>

His body was found and returned to Castle Black. Later, his body was burned alongside Othor's after a failed attack on the Lord Commander.
            Jafer Flowers is a ranger in the Night's Watch. His name, Flowers, suggests that he was a bastard from the Reach before joining the Watch. He and Othor accompanied Benjen Stark's ranging mission beyond the Wall. Both Jafar and Othor are killed while on this mission.
            Jon Snow's direwolf, Ghost, finds Jafer's severed hand in the Haunted Forest.[1] The corpses of Othor and the rest of Jafer Flowers are found beyond the Wall by Samwell Tarly, Jon and a party led by Othell Yarwyck. They return the corpses to Castle Black and suggest they be burned, but Lord Commander Jeor Mormont decides to let Maester Aemon examine them first.[2]
            At night, the corpses rise as wights. While Othor attacks Lord Commander Mormont, Flowers causes trouble elsewhere before being put down and burned. Both bodies are re-burned the next day, to be sure. Samwell notes that according to a book he found in Aemon's library, the touch of the White Walkers can animate the dead.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jafer Flowers's background is the same as in the show.
            Jafer's wight attacked the main castle garrison. It killed five men, among them Ser Jaremy Rykker, and continued to attack even after having its head cut off - it was only subdued after being chopped to pieces by a dozen swordsmen.
            Unlike in the series, when the bodies of Othor and Jafer were brought to Castle Black, both corpses had blue eyes - different from the eye color they had in their lives.
            Jafer's severed hand, which was torn by Ghost, continued to twitch and stir long after Jafer was destroyed. Alliser Thorne took it to King's Landing, but it had rotted away while he was waiting for an audience.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jafer_Flowers</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascJaferFlowers</string></dict>
        <key>Denner</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.316.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Denner, also known as Frostfinger is a member of the Night's Watch. He oversees the training of new recruits.
            Frostfinger is an old hand in the Night's Watch and responsible for training handfuls of recruits who arrive at the Wall while Alliser Thorne acts as temporary Lord Commander.
            Frostfinger then gives a speech to the new recruits about the Night's Watch, what it stands for and what they must do. During this some recruits begin talking and Frostfinger interrogates Gared as to who it was. Frostfinger then oversees the training of the new recruits which involves a series of activities: crossbow shooting, sword fighting and lifting barrels. During the training he has a private conversation with Jon Snow.
            When a fight breaks out between Finn and Gared, Frostfinger breaks it up and decides to punish them both. When Jon Snow requests that Gared instead comes with him to patrol the top of the wall, Frostfinger agrees. Frostfinger prepares to take Finn with him, however Finn refuses and Frostfinger slaps him across the face for his insolence.
            Later, Frostfinger calls role for a new batch of recruits, among whom is Britt Warrick, who killed Gared's family. Britt attempts to intimidate Gared, but is ordered to move along by Frostfinger.
            Several nights later, Frostfinger is overseeing the men keeping watch on top of the Wall. He finds Finn talking with Gared and orders him back to his post, and reminds Gared to keep the torches lit, in order to "let the wildlings know we're still home."
            Later that night, Gared escapes with the help of Cotter. If Gared is caught while sneaking out of Castle Black, Frostfinger will shoot him with a crossbow in a non-canon death scene. He otherwise doesn't appear again.
            It's very possible that Frostfinger wanted to execute Gared for killing Britt, despite knowing that Gared acted in self defense. That could be because if Gared were to avoid execution for killing a brother, others could do the same and then plead self defense, unleashing anarchy in The Wall.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Denner_Frostfinger</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDenner</string></dict>
        <key>Denys Mallister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.317.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Denys Mallister is a knight of House Mallister and the commander of the Shadow Tower, the westernmost of the three still operational castles of the Night's Watch. He is the uncle of Lord Jason Mallister of Seagard.[1]
            Ser Denys Mallister is a senior member of the Night's Watch. He has commanded the Shadow Tower, the western-most castle still manned by the Watch, for 20 years.[2]
            Following the death of Jeor Mormont, a choosing for the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch will take place. Samwell Tarly tells Gilly that Denys Mallister is running against Ser Alliser Thorne. He states that Denys is a good man and thinks that he wouldn't send Gilly away, which is what will probably happen if Alliser is chosen.[2]
            Denys is present at the choosing for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, but ultimately loses to Jon Snow. He salutes Jon to congratulate him.[3]
            Denys Mallister was played by J.J. Murphy, who died four days after filming his first scenes, at the age of 86. Co-creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have announced the character will not be recast as Murphy "was a lovely man, and the best Denys Mallister we could have hoped for. And now his watch is ended."[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Denys Mallister is an old man who has commanded the Shadow Tower for thirty-three years. Ser Denys was born at Seagard, a squire at twelve, a knight at eighteen, and a champion at twenty-two years old. He had been a candidate in the two last elections of Lord Commanders of the Night's Watch.
            Ser Denys has blue-grey eyes and a long white beard. He has lost almost all his hair and his face is deeply lined though he still has his teeth and is graceful in his movement. In his communication with other people he is very courteous. He is considered cautious and chivalrous. He's also distrustful of ironborn, due to his upbringing at Seagard, which had been built as a defense against raiders from the Iron Islands.
            Denys Mallister's supporter at the election in "The House of Black and White" says that he joined the Night's Watch as a boy, and has served through ten winters: this cannot literally be true, and is either a dialogue error or his supporter should be understood as just speaking loosely (as if he said "a dozen" but was rounding). In Season 1, Tyrion stated that he has lived through nine winters, the longest of which was the three year winter his was born during - placing that ninth winter about 36 years ago (less in the novels, as Tyrion is a little older in the TV series). Mallister's supporter could not have meant that he "commanded the Shadow Tower through ten winters", because in the previous episode Samwell said that Mallister has commanded it for twenty years - which would contradict Tyrion's statement that there have only been nine winters in nearly forty years. Mallister is stated to have joined the Watch as a boy, and rounding that to 16, he was serving at the Wall for about 70 years: given the rough rate at which the multi-year seasons occur in Westeros, there had to have been more than one other winter between when Mallister joined the Watch seventy years ago, and when Tyrion was born nearly forty years ago. The summer that ended when King Robert died lasted ten years, and was stated to be the longest in living memory: seasons don't normally last that long, and given that Tyrion said in Season 1 that there were 9 winters in the 33 years he'd been alive, there had to have been other winters in that time period.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Denys_Mallister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDenysMallister</string></dict>

        <key>Daario Naharis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.319.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Daario Naharis was originally a lieutenant in the Second Sons, a sellsword company, before taking over the company and killing his superiors Mero and Prendahl na Ghezn. He then aligns with Daenerys Targaryen, and serves as her advisor and enforcer, and also eventually becomes her lover, but he is forced to part ways with her when she sails for Westeros, remaining in the Bay of Dragons to enforce the Queen's peace.
            Daario is a Tyroshi sellsword, employed as a lieutenant in the Second Sons. He is apparently held in high enough regard by the company's co-captains, Mero and Prendahl na Ghezn, that they allow him to join them in contract negotiations and discussions of the company's future.
            According to Daario, his mother was a prostitute, and he comes from low beginnings. At the age of 12, Daario was sold by his mother to a slave master from Tolos due to her declining income, alcoholism and his aggressive, unruly behavior and tendency to get into fights with other boys. He was trained as a pit fighter and had his first match in the pits when he was 16. Daario rose to fame within the fighting pits earning his master so much money that at the time of his master's death Daario was rewarded with freedom. Daario chose to fight as a sellsword for the Second Sons sometime after that.[1]
            Besides being fluent in the Common Tongue, Daario is also fluent in Low Valyrian due to his Tyroshi origin. Daario also seems to speak some Dothraki, though it is unknown if he is fluent in it.
            Daario has an unusual code for a sellsword; he won't sleep with prostitutes and only kills soldiers who are trying to kill him, not bystanders. He does this because he feels that otherwise there is no sport and it is not exciting. Daario has said that the gods gave men two things to entertain themselves with before they die: the thrill of having sex with a woman who earnestly wants it, and the thrill of killing a man who is trying to kill you first.
            Daario is a highly skilled and capable warrior. Being trained a pit fighter since the age of 12 and then fighting as a sellsword after that, mostly all of Daario's life has revolved around fighting. During his years as a pit fighter he learned to fight with several different fighting styles; like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest and a Westerosi knight. Daario has over several different occasions proven his skills in combat: when he reveals to Daenerys that he single-handedly managed to kill both of the commanding officers of the Second Sons, when he along Ser Jorah and Grey Worm fight severly outnumbered against several guards in the streets of Yunkai, when he kills the Champion of Meereen in single combat with ease or when protecting Daenerys, Tyrion, and Missandei from hundreds of Sons of the Harpy along with Ser Jorah, coming out on top, unharmed, despite being outnumbered severely.
            Daario's weapons-of-choice are a Dothraki arakh and a Myrish stiletto, both which have gold-plated custom-made hilts in the shape of beautiful, naked women. His fighting style is based on speed and quick, accurate strikes with few, mostly finishing, blows based on pure strength due to his relatively small size and lean build compared to the larger, stronger opponents he frequently faced in the fighting pits.
            DaarioÂ Naharis joins the captains when they visit Daenerys Targaryen, who hopes to convince them to break their contract with Yunkai and fight for her instead. Daario sees through Daenerys's bluff that she has 10,000 Unsullied, reminding her that she has only 8,000. When the Second Sons depart with Daenerys's offer and a barrel of wine, Daario's gaze lingers on the young queen.
            Back at their own camp, Daario, Mero and Prendahl discuss the situation, with Mero and Prendahl deciding to assassinate Daenerys. At Mero's behest, a bedslave hands out random coins â Daario draws the Braavosi coin that indicates he is the one to do the deed. His only response is "valar morghulis" - "all men must die". That night, Daario, wearing the armor of an Unsullied slips into Daenerys' tent and takes Missandei hostage. He then presents the heads of Mero and Prendahl and informs her he has taken command of the Second Sons. Intrigued, Daenerys demands that he swear fealty to her. Daario bends the knee and swears the Second Sons, his sword, his life, and his heart to Daenerys.[2]
            Daario later assists in planning the siege of Yunkai, and is selected, along with Ser Jorah Mormont and Grey Worm to infiltrate the city and open the gates from the inside. The plan succeeds brilliantly, and Jorah and Grey Worm return to their queen triumphant. Daenerys expresses concern over Daario's whereabouts, but he appears a moment later, presenting Yunkai's bloodstained flag to her.[3]
            Daario is present outside the walls of Yunkai when Daenerys is greeted by the former slaves who have been liberated. He witnesses as the crowd lifts Daenerys up in the air as they shout "Mhysa" to her.[4]
            Ser Barristan and Missandei reveal that Grey Worm and Daario have been indulging in a bit of gambling; they have been at the contest since midnight and have missed a morning meeting with the queen as a result. Daenerys is very irritated to discover that their contest is a game of who can balance their sword for the longest, the prize being the honor of riding at her side when the march resumes. Daenerys assigns the pair to guard the livestock as punishment for their childish game. When they fail to move, she warns them that the "winner" of the contest must find a new queen, prompting them to drop their weapons instantly. Grey Worm's gaze lingers on Missandei, which Daario takes as a sign that he is interested in her, and points out that this problematic given Grey Worm's eunuch status. Grey WormÂ tells Daario that he is not a smart man for saying such things, to which Daario replies that he would rather have no brain and two balls.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daario_Naharis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDaarioNaharis</string></dict>

        <key>Daemon II Blackfyre</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.321.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Daemon II Blackfyre was a member of House Blackfyre.
            Daemon II Blackfyre was the third son of Daemon Blackfyre, a legitimized bastard son of King Aegon IV Targaryen and his cousin Daena Targaryen, by Serena Blackfyre. He had two elder brothers: Aegon and Aemon Blackfyre.
            Daemon II, along with his siblings is mentioned in the House Targaryen entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daemon II was the third son of Daemon Blackfyre. He appears in The Mystery Knight, the third novella of the Tales of Dunk and Egg series. His two older brothers died childless, so when they were slain along with their father at the Battle of Redgrass Field, Daemon II became the nominal head of House Blackfyre as it fled into exile.
            Daemon II was an attractive man with classic Targaryen features of silver hair and purple eyes. He even had prophetic dreams, a trait passed down through the Targaryen/Blackfyre bloodline. Secretly, Daemon II actually wasn't a great fighter: all of his practice duels and jousts had been publicly staged, and the knights he allegedly lost to had actually been paid to feign defeat.
            George R.R. Martin has confirmed that Daemon II was a homosexual. He apparently never fathered any children, meaning that his younger brother Haegon Blackfyre was his direct heir.
            Daemon II attempted to instigate another uprising in the name of House Blackfyre in the year 212 AL, sixteen years after the First Blackfyre Rebellion. To accomplish this, he posed as a common fiddler (by dyeing his distinctive silver hair black), and attending a large tournament being held by House Butterwell at Whitewalls, in the Riverlands. While there, he hoped to surreptitiously recruit many of the well-armed knights in attendance to his cause.
            Due to a series of events, however (which Ser Duncan the Tall and Aegon V Targaryen participated in), Daemon II revealed his true identity and faced the hedge knight Ser Glendon Flowers in a Trial by combat, in the format of a joust. Despite having been badly tortured the night before, and still suffering from his injuries, Glendon unhorsed Daemon II on the very first tilt, revealing to all gathered at the tournament that he wasn't the great fighter he thought he was, much less a legendary fighter like his father Daemon I. Any support he had quickly evaporated, and the "Second Blackfyre Rebellion" turned out to be more of a failed plot than an actual war like the first rebellion. Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers soon arrived at the tournament with a royal army and arrested him. Bloodraven intended to keep him alive and imprisoned, however, to discourage his uncle Bittersteel and the other Blackfyre supporters in exile from crowning Daemon II's younger brother Haegon as the new head of House Blackfyre.
            Not only was Daemon II secretly terrible at martial combat, he wasn't even a very good actor. Much of his plot hinged around pretending to be a commoner named "Ser John the Fiddler" to infiltrate a tournament inconspicuously, and secretly win over knights to his cause. Daemon II, however, continued to dress in fine expensive clothing, which raised obvious suspicions about how a common fiddler could afford fine silks. Moreover, Daemon II also talked down to high-ranking noblemen as if he was their equal or superior - not realizing that commoners would never speak so rudely, and causing many to grow suspicious of him (even Ser Duncan, born a street urchin and not very politically savvy, quickly realized "John the Fiddler"'s behavior was very odd).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daemon_II_Blackfyre</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDaemonIIBlackfyre</string></dict>
        <key>Davos Seaworth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.322.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Davos Seaworth, also known as the Onion Knight,Â is a landed knight, and a former smuggler who was in the service of Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and claimant to the Iron Throne, whom he served as Hand of the King.
            After Stannis's defeat and death at Winterfell, Davos remains at Castle Black, where he is caught in the midst of a mutiny among the Night's Watch that initially led to the death of Lord Commander Jon Snow. Siding with Jon's followers, Davos becomes one of his lieutenants after persuading Melisandre to resurrect Jon. He later sides with House Stark and proclaims Jon Snow the King in the North after Jon retakes Winterfell from House Bolton.
            Ser Davos Seaworth is a landed knight and a reformed smuggler. His ship used to ply the Narrow Sea, smuggling goods from the Free Cities into the Seven KingdomsÂ and back again.
            Davos was born in Flea Bottom, the poorest slum in King's Landing. His father was a poor crabber. He became a sailor while very young to escape the slums and has spent most of his life sailing the Narrow Sea. His black-sailed ship became infamous for sneaking into harbors in the dead of night while avoiding detection.[1]
            During Robert's Rebellion, Davos aided Stannis Baratheon while he was besieged in Storm's End, by delivering smuggled onions and other foodstuffs into the castle. The supplies helped Stannis's forces survive until the end of the war. For this service, Stannis rewarded Davos by bestowing him with knighthood and lands. However, as punishment for his past crimes, he also cut off the fingers of one of Davos' hands at the knuckles and placed the severed limbs in a bag to be worn around the former smuggler's neck. Davos regarded this as the first time he had ever seen true justice served.
            He chose the name "Seaworth" for his family's new noble House, as a reference to his smuggling past. Highborn members of older noble Houses disparagingly called Davos "the Onion Knight" for his actions, but he has embraced this title and proudly took an onion for a sigil and sewed it onto his ship's sails.[2]
            Stannis also cut off four finger tips from Davos' right hand as punishment for his smuggling crimes. Thieves in Westeros are often sentenced to having fingers or the whole hand removed, but Stannis only took the fingertips of his less used hand (his right, as Davos is left-handed). Davos submitted to this punishment willingly, judging it a fair exchange in return for improving his family's future prospects. He also mentions in a featuretteÂ that he submitted to the punishment forÂ the sake of sheer justice, saying he "avoided punishment for too long" and that this was the first instance he had ever seen of true justice being served.Â He wears his severed finger bones in a pouch about his neck and believes they bring him good luck.[2][3]
            Davos is one of Stannis's most loyal and reliable vassals and arguably his best friend, but is treated with disdain by some of the other lords of Westeros for his low birth. Stannis himself points out that it was the low-born Davos, and not the high-born lords, who saved the lives of Stannis and his castle garrison. Davos is one of the only men who can (even grudgingly) influence Stannis's decisions, because he values Davos's honest advice above that of noble-born flatterers.[4]
            Davos has several sons, including Matthos, who serves with him on his ship and is a scribe for Stannis.[5] He is proud of his son's education but remains illiterate.[6]
            Even though Stannis's wife Selyse despises Ser Davos (despite him having saved her life), their daughter Shireen is fond of him and considers him a friend, while Davos loves her like his own daughter.[7]
            King Stannis Baratheon converts to the religion of the Lord of Light and allows his priestess Melisandre to burn the statues of the Seven outside Dragonstone. Davos is agnostic but watches with interest beside his son Matthos Seaworth, a devoted convert. Maester Cressen attempts to interrupt the ceremony but is casually dismissed by Melisandre. She proclaims Stannis as a prophesied hero when he draws a flaming sword from one of the statues.[8]
            Stannis hosts a council and prepares a letter to be distributed throughout the Seven Kingdoms. He has learned from the late Eddard Stark that Joffrey Baratheon is a bastard born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime rather than being Robert Baratheon's true heir. Stannis is therefore the rightful heir and plans to pursue his claims to the throne despite being outnumbered. His younger brother Renly Baratheon has also claimed the throne, to Stannis's frustration. Davos urges Stannis to temporarily make peace with Renly or join forces with Robb Stark to fight against Joffrey but Stannis refuses, denouncing them both as thieves. Cressen attempts to poison Melisandre. Davos sees him put something in the wine cup. Cressen then offers Melisandre that they put aside their disagreement through drinking a toast from the same cup.
            Davos realizes what he is doing and unsuccessfully tries to stop him. Cressen drinks the poison first to make Melisandre feel safer. She also realizes his plan but drains the rest of the liquid regardless. Cressen quickly bleeds to death while Melisandre stands over his corpse unharmed.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Davos_Seaworth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDavosSeaworth</string></dict>
        <key>Dagmer</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.323.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dagmer was a noted ironborn reaver in the service of House Greyjoy.
            Dagmer is an ironborn raider and reaver, noted for his skill in battle and his loyalty to House Greyjoy.
            Dagmer emerges from the tavern and offers to take Theon to their ship, the Sea Bitch. Theon asks who he is and Dagmer explains that he is to act as Theonâs first mate. Theon questions why Dagmer is separated from the rest of the crew and wonders if they have sent Dagmer to kill him when they are on their way to the ship. Dagmer says that the men will not respect Theon until he has proven himself. Theon wonders how he can prove himself when his father has ordered him to attack fishing villages on the Stony Shore. Theon asks Dagmer how he can prove himself a true iron islander with such a task. Dagmer tells him that his crew are all iron islanders and asks Theon how they respond to orders. Theon sees logic in Dagmerâs words and suggests attacking Torrhenâs Square that lies near to the Stony Shore. Dagmer says that the seat of House Tallhart here is a worthy prize as Theon contemplates his idea. Dagmer wonders if Theon doubts their ability to take it. Theon says that they could but would only be able to hold it for a few days. He explains that Winterfell would hear of their victory and then House Stark would send men of their own to take it back. Theon considers this opportunity and then instructs Dagmer to take him to his ship.[1]
            Theon besieges Torrhen's Square and then strikes at Winterfell once it has been left poorly defended. He seizes the castle and forces Bran Stark to yield to him by threatening his people. Lorren captures Ser Rodrik Cassel as he returns from Torrhen's Square. The master-at-arms is defiant and spits in Theon's face. Dagmer insists that Theon must have him executed to maintain the respect of the crew. Rodrik baits Theon into swinging the sword himself and Theon fumbles the task, requiring four blows to sever his head.[2]
            Osha seduces Theon and frees Prince Bran and Rickon Stark. She murders Drennan while escaping the castle. Dagmer and Theon discover the corpse the next morning. Lorren blames Theon for being seduced and Theon brutally beats him as Dagmer looks on with approval. They go out to hunt for the boys with hounds and track them to a shepherd's farm before losing the scent. Dagmer finds cracked walnut shells at the farm, a favorite food of Rickon. Theon brutalizes the shepherd who insists that he has not seen the Stark princes. The Ironborn return to Winterfell with two charred corpses that Theon publicly claims are Bran and Rickon.[3] Theon has Winterfell's ravens poisoned to prevent word spreading of the murders. Yara fails to reinforce Theon as requested, instead visiting with twenty men to urge him to abandon Winterfell. Theon refuses to give up his prize. Theon gives gold to Dagmer to buy the silence of the farmer whose boys they killed; Dagmer explains that he also murdered the farmer and his wife.[4]
            As Theon is rallying the last remaining men to fight, Dagmer hits him over the head, knocking him out cold. He places a cloth bag over his head and Theon is dragged away. When Maester Luwin tries to intervene, Dagmer stabs him.[5]
            After reading a letter from Ramsay Snow, who is holding Theon prisoner, Balon and Yara Greyjoy learn that Dagmer and his men were betrayed and flayed alive by Ramsay and the soldiers of House Bolton despite Robb Stark's promise of mercy.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Dagmer Cleftjaw is the captain of the Foamdrinker andÂ the master-at-arms atÂ Pyke.
            Dagmer has snow white hair. A longaxe blow had nearly killed him as a child, splintering his jaw, smashing his front teeth and leaving him four lips instead of two and a hideous scar, hence his nickname (this is changed in the show to a scar along the left of his jaw instead of directly down the middle to save money on CGI or make-up). He has a shaggy beard, but the hair does not grow where the scar is. He wears many rings, gold and silver and bronze, set with sapphire and garnet and dragonglass, all of which he won by the iron price.
            Dagmer is proud but not prickly. He often smiles to show approval. He is a solid and dependable commander, but has been known to take gambles if he believes the reward is great enough. He enjoys listening to the song an unnamed singer wrote about the axe that cracked his jaw. Whenever he is drunk, he calls for a reaving song, something loud and stormy that told of dead heroes and deeds of wild valor.
            According to Old Nan, Dagmer cannot be killed, and once a foe had cut his head in two with an axe, but Dagmer was so fierce he'd just pushed the two halves back together and held them until they healed up.
            When Balon was fifteen, he and Dagmer sailed to the Stepstones and spent a summer reaving.
            Dagmer is remembered fondly by TheonÂ from his childhood: Dagmer has trained him in arms, riding, and boatmanship, and often smiled at him; heÂ has treated Theon more warmly than his own father and Ned Stark together. Theon calls him "uncle" because Dagmer has a pinch of Greyjoy blood four or five lives back, and that from the wrong side of the blanket.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dagmer</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDagmer</string></dict>

            At some point he purchased Beskha and when she was seven he forced her to fight in an arena, after growing bored of watching her kill animals he sent in other children instead and forced them to kill each other for nothing more than his own amusement. Ten years ago, Beskha bought her freedom, however, she still wishes for vengeance.
            Beskha will leave Croft's planned route through Meereen. When Asher Forrester and Croft follow, they find her holding Dezhor at sword-point. When Croft objects to the plan, Asher can choose whether to allow Beskha to kill him which will improve her opinion of Asher but risk the wrath of Daenerys Targaryen who had ordered them not to kill any of the masters, he can follow Daenerys' orders and stop Beskha which greatly annoys her or Asher can just kill him himself much to the dismay of both Beskha and Croft.
            While there is no equivalent character in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is a mention that in some fighting pits on Astapor slave children are employed as entertainment. For example in Douquor's pit there is mention of a "folly" involving a bear and three small boys - One boy is to be rolled in honey, one in blood and one in rotting fish, and spectators can bet on which child will the bear devour first. There is also a mention of a nine year old girl fighting at Jothiel's Pit.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dezhor_zo_Raza</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDezhorzoRaza</string></dict>
        <key>Dalton Greyjoy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.325.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>After Aegon I Targaryen conquered Westeros, the Ironborn were forced to end their reaving and abandon the Old Way. The Ironborn would tell each other tales of how they would eventually rise again, something that caught the attention of Dalton, who was the wild young heir to Pyke. He rowed at the age of five, reaved at ten in the Basilisk Isles with his uncle, and by the age of fourteen, he had sailed as far as Old Ghis, fought in a dozen battles and claimed four salt wives. At the age of fifteen, he avenged his uncle's death in battle, taking a dozen wounds, and his entire body ended up covered in blood, earning him the nickname "the Red Kraken".[1]
            During the Dance of Dragons, Dalton and the Ironborn sided with Rhaenyra Targaryen's Blacks since it allowed them to attack the Westerlands held by House Lannister, whose troops were away fighting for Aegon II Targaryen's Greens. The Ironborn were not able to take Casterly Rock, since Lady Johanna Lannister was able bar its gates, and they instead burned the Lannister fleet and sacked Lannisport, taking gold, grain and hundreds of women and girls, including Lord Jason Lannister's favorite mistress and all his bastards.[1]
            Dalton controlled the Sunset Sea and had returned the Ironborn to the Old Way. After the end of the war, the Iron Throne commanded that he stop his plundering, but Dalton refused. Shortly afterwards, one of his mistresses slit his throat while he was asleep, causing a succession dispute between his sons. The Lannisters used the opportunity to send troops to the Iron Islands, who killed thousands of men, women and children, and burned scores of villages and hundred of longships.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dalton_Greyjoy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDaltonGreyjoy</string></dict>
        <key>Dareon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.326.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dareon is a newly made Steward of the Night's Watch, of the same group of recruits as Jon Snow.
            Dareon is present during the speech Lord Commander Jeor Mormont gave to the "graduating" recruits. Dareon is assigned to the Stewards and Maester Aemon sends him to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, where he is to present himself to Borcas.[1]
            While fleeing back to the Wall, Samwell Tarly tells Gilly that it will be pleasant at Castle Black: Hobb the cook makes nice food, and Dareon often sings at meal-time.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Dareon is an apprentice singer from the Reach, sent to the Wall after being caught in bed with a daughter of Lord Mathis Rowan. Even though Dareon maintains that she was waiting for him naked and helped him into her room, she named it rape under her father's eye.
            He's also an excellent singer, known to sing for the Watch during dinners; Maester Aemon describes his voice as "honey poured over thunder." Jon describes him as "quick but afraid of being hit."
            In "A Feast for Crows" Jon sends Dareon alongside Sam, Gilly and Maester Aemon to Oldtown via Braavos, hoping that Dareon's singing would encourage recruitment to the Night's Watch. Dareon, however, spends his time in Braavos whoring and drinking. Sam finds Dareon in a brothel, where he married a whore. Sam confronts Dareon for breaking his vows and demands that he return with him to the inn where they stay, but Dareon teases him. For the first time in his life, Sam loses his temper and beats Dareon up, and is thrown from the brothel. Sam, Gilly and Aemon leave Braavos for Oldtown without Dareon.
            Arya followes Dareon to a dark alley, slits his throat and loots his body. It is the first time Arya murders in cold blood someone who never did any ill to her, her family or her friends, and did not threaten or provoke her in any way. She justifies her deed by claiming that Dareon was a deserter of the Night's Watch, but it is doubtful that Arya - who dissociated herself from her past life, thus no longer considered as Stark or Westerosi - had the right to act as the prosecutor/judge/executioner, and the way she killed Dareon did not resemble even closely to a formal execution. After committing that murder, Arya is given the milk that makes her blind.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dareon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDareon</string></dict>
        <key>Daemon I Blackfyre</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.327.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Daemon I Blackfyre, born Daemon Waters, was a bastard son of Princess Daena Targaryen and King Aegon IV Targaryen. Legitimized by his father upon the latter's death, Daemon took the name "Blackfyre" for himself, after the ancestral Valyrian steel sword of House Targaryen, which his father also bequeathed him. Despite his bastard status Daemon believed himself the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, as his father's firstborn (and favourite) child and ignited a bloody civil war against his half-brother Daeron II Targaryen. Despite support from nearly half the realm, Daemon and his supporters were routed in the war's final, climatic battle, and Daemon himself perished, along with his two eldest sons.
            Daemon Blackfyre was the legitimized bastard son of King Aegon IV Targaryen and his cousin, Daena Targaryen. He was one of the infamous Great Bastards. After his legitimization, he founded his own new noble House as a cadet branch of House Targaryen: House Blackfyre, named after the ancestral Valyrian steel sword of House Targaryen which his father gave him. He led a rebellion against his half-brother King Daeron II Targaryen, the legitimate Targaryen heir, but was defeated and killed at the climactic Battle of the Redgrass Field.
            With Serena Blackfyre, he fathered the twins Aegon and Aemon Blackfyre, and Daemon II Blackfyre.
            Daemon, along with his trueborn siblings and his offspring, is mentioned in the House Targaryen entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms. The tome mentions that he rose in rebellion against his half-brother but perished from wounds sustained at the Battle of Redgrass Field.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daemon is mentioned several times. More of his backstory is revealed in the Tales of Dunk and Egg.
            Daemon was born Daemon Waters, only taking the name Blackfyre after he had been legitimized by his father. He was named after his great-grandfather Prince Daemon Targaryen.
            After the Dance of the Dragons, the civil war between Rhaenyra and Aegon II Targaryen, House Targaryen's royal succession laws were revised to put female heirs behind all possible male ones - specifically that if all of one king's sons die, the throne will pass to his younger brother before it passes to his own daughters. Under the normal succession laws of the Andals, a daughter inherits before an uncle. Both Rhaenyra and Aegon II died in the Dance, but were succeeded by Rhaenyra's son Aegon III. His two sons Daeron and Baelor became king after him but died without issue. Aegon III did have three daughters, but at this point the new succession laws came into play, so Baelor was succeeded by Aegon III's younger brother Viserys II, who in turn was succeeded by his own son Aegon IV.
            Had the new succession laws not gone into effect, Aegon III's daughters would have inherited ahead of Aegon IV, instead of being skipped over for their uncle Viserys II. As it happened, the oldest of these three daughters, Daena, had an affair with Aegon IV, her own first cousin, which produced their bastard son Daemon Blackfyre.
            The result is that Daemon and the rest of House Blackfyre are actually descended from older brother Aegon III, while all subsequent members of the main line of House Targaryen (i.e. Daenerys) are descended from younger brother Viserys II.
            Daemon was a bastard, and though legitimized, he was simply younger than Daeron II. Therefore, part of his claim to the throne rested on the flimsy accusation that Daeron II was himself a bastard, fathered by Aegon IV's younger brother Aemon the Dragonknight. However, others pointed out that Daemon's mother Daena would have been ahead of Daeron II's grandfather Viserys II, had the succession laws not been arbitrarily changed.
            Ultimately, Daemon Blackfyre proclaimed himself king, plunging the Seven Kingdoms into the Blackfyre Rebellion. At the climactic Battle of Redgrass Field, Daemon fought 'like the Warrior himself' with Blackfyre in hand, and fought an epic duel with Ser Gwayne Corbray of the Kingsguard for an hour, before finally wounding him. Daemon could arguably have won the battle if he'd moved on from Gwayne, but instead he protected his opponent and paid for it with his life - Brynden Rivers and his company of longbowman, the Raven's Teeth, took the Weeping Ridge, and rained arrows down onto Daemon Blackfyre from 300 yards away, killing Daemon and his twin sons. Brynden was cursed as a "kinslayer" for this, despite there being no way of knowing whose arrow had struck the fatal blow itself (though either way, it was a company of archers he commanded). Years later, however, Brynden personally beheaded Daemon's younger son Aenys Blackfyre (his own half-nephew) while under a flag of truce, making himself both certainly a kinslayer and an oathbreaker - for which he was exiled to the Night's Watch.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daemon_I_Blackfyre</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDaemonIBlackfyre</string></dict>

            Ser Damon was a knight of House Morrigen and a devotee of the Faith Militant who commanded the order's chapter in King's Landing. When newly-crowned King Maegor Targaryen returned to King's Landing, he challenged the Faith Militant to a Trial by combat to prove his right to rule. They accepted, and the resulting trial of seven pitted Maegor and six of his Kingsguard against Ser Damon and six other champions of the Faith Militant. The tales about the resulting confrontation are many, but by the end, of the fourteen men who entered the field only Maegor was left alive.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Damon Morrien is the commander of the Warrior's Sons - one of two military orders that comprises the Faith Militant. In the TV show the Faith Militant is condensed into a single order.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Damon_Morrigen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDamonMorrigen</string></dict>
        <key>Daemon Sand</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.330.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Daemon Sand is a Dornish knight, and served as squire for Prince Oberyn Martell during the trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister.
            Daemon squires for Prince Oberyn Martell during Tyrion Lannister's trial by combat, and coats his master's spear head with deadly manticore venom. He witnesses the Red Viper's death at the hands of Ser Gregor Clegane.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Daemon Sand, also known as "The Bastard of Godsgrace", is Ser Ryon Allyrion's natural born son. He serves Prince Oberyn Martell as squire, and received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself. There are also rumors that he is one of Oberyn's lovers, though this is seldom said to his face.
            Ser Daemon is close friends with Arianne Martell, daughter and heir of Prince Doran, and took her maidenhood when they were both fourteen. When Prince Doran learned of this he didn't seek to punish Daemon, but refused to allow him to marry his daughter.
            Daemon is first introduced when he arrives at King's Landing among Oberyn's retinue. In "A Feast for Crows", Qyburn informs Cersei that Daemon was imprisoned at Doran's command, because he demanded that the Sand Snakes - who were imprisoned to prevent them from igniting a war with the Lannisters - be released. Eventually, Doran has him freed alongside Princess Arianne and the Sand Snakes.
            Daemon is present at the feast when SerÂ Balon SwannÂ arrives atÂ SunspearÂ to deliver the Mountain's head. He is one of those who express their disapproval by not joining the toast Doran makes to King Tommen.
            Currently, he is escorting Arianne to meet potential allies.
            He is considered to be one of Dorne's finest swordsmen.
            House Allyrion belongs to the group known as "Salty Dornishmen", who live along the coasts of Dorne and the Greenblood river system. This group has the most Rhoynar blood of all Dornishmen and generally possess olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes. Daemon's brief appearance in Season 4 of the TV series did not resemble this, but as it turns out, in the books he is not described as having classic "salty Dornish" features. Instead, he is said to have sky blue eyes and light sandy brown hair. The simple explanation may be that he takes after his non-Allyrion parent in looks, and this parent was either a "stony Dornishman" from the western mountains, or possibly from somewhere outside of Dorne entirely.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daemon_Sand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDaemonSand</string></dict>
        <key>Gryff Whitehill</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.331.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gryff Whitehill is the fourthborn son of Lord Ludd Whitehill.
            As a child, Gryff was routinely bullied by his older brothers. His father, Ludd, stood up for him however, saying, "A Whitehill is a Whitehill", even if he was fourth born. He grew into an aggressive, pushy man who desires to rule a castle of his own, and takes much pleasure in usurping control of Ironrath and humiliating Rodrik, its legitimate lord.".[1] He is described by Duncan Tuttle as being a "fourthborn son with something to prove".[2]
            At the time after the Red Wedding, Gryff was at Harrenhal.[3]
            When Ramsay Snow states that a garrison of Whitehill men will be stationed in Ironrath depending on how Lord Ethan responds Ramsay will ask Ludd Whitehill if he has someone he can trust to lead the garrison, Ludd confirms this and states that his son Gryff will lead it.[4]
            Lord Whitehill bursts in on Rodrik Forrester and explains that his son Gryff is on his way from Harrenhal to meet up with the Whitehill's garrison at Ironrath. He will lead them to ensure the Forresters stay in line. It is also mentioned that Gryff is the fourth born son of Ludd Whitehill.[5]
            Gryff appears in person in this episode. The Whitehill soldiers occupying Ironrath begin to assemble in the court yard and set a tent on fire. Gryff then shows himself to the annoyed Rodrik Forrester and declares control of Ironrath despite resistance from Rodrik and Elissa. He then demands residence in the Great Hall forcing Rodrik to comply.
            Later a Whitehill guard is bit by Talia and Gryff demands justice from Rodrik. When Rodrik grabs and defends Talia he is pushed to the ground by Gryff continuously and demands that he stays down threatening him saying that Talia will meet the same fate as Ethan.[6]
            As Ironrath is still occupied by Whitehill soldiers. Lord Glenmore agreed to wed Gryff to his daughter Elaena Glenmore. However Elaena disagrees with the forced marriage and seeks out Rodriks help. It is agreed that Rodrik will kill Gryff Whitehill with the help of Arthur Glenmore's elite men. Rodrik then confronts Gryff as he is 'punishing' the maester for 'letting the bite wound fester.' Rodrik stands up to Gryff and confronts him, after a small brawl the Glenmore men march in and take hold of the Whitehill soldiers. The player is given the option to simply imprison Gryff, or beat him with increasing amounts of severity before Elissa steps in and stops Rodrik from killing Gryff, lest the Whitehills take vengeance on Ryon. At this point the player can choose to send Gryff to the dungeons or alternatively spit on him, or knock him out before having him sent to the dungeons. If Gryff is maimed but not knocked out, he will groan that he cannot see meaning Rodrik possibly blinded Gryff's left eye. He is then dragged to the cellars.[7]
            Gryff remains imprisoned during Ramsay Snow's visit to Ironrath. However, he is later freed by the traitor.
            Gryff later leads the Whitehill ambush of Asher Forrester'sÂ hiredÂ pit fighters as the arrive in Westeros. After Asher and Rodrik are trapped in the port town, Gryff rides up on horseback, commanding the attack. He looks on smugly as either Asher or Rodrik remains behind and is slain by his soldiers.[8]
            If Asher survives the Ambush at the Harbor, Gryff orders his troops to pursue Asher and make a second attempt at killing him, however Asher's counter-attack wipes out Gryff's soldiers, alarming Ludd sufficiently to seek peace with the new Lord Forrester. Ludd arrives at Ironrath with Gryff to offer terms, where Gryff mocks Asher. Gryff returns with the rest of House Whitehill for the White Engagement at Ironrath to celebrate the new peace agreement, where he proceeds to taunt Asher over his time in Essos as a sellsword. If Asher chose to ambush the Whitehills or make peace, Gryff attacks Asher but is slain in the battle after being stabbed and thrown in a roaring fire pit. If Ludd was poisoned, Gryff is bested and disarmed by Asher, however before Asher can deliver the killing blow, Gwyn stabs Asher in the back, allowing Gryff to flee and rally the rest of the Whitehill army and seize Ironrath. Gryff is later seen marching into Ironrath at the head of his army.
            
            If Rodrik survives the Ambush at the Harbor, Gryff appears, alongside Lord Whitehill, leading the Whitehill army towards Ironrath. During Rodrik's raid on the Whitehill camp, Gryff is seen conversing with Ludd and remarks that he will cut off Ryon's legs so he will not be able to escape. Ludd also gives additional orders to kill Ryon if he was to die under any circumstances. If targeted, Gryff is seen abusing Ryon until he is confronted and stabbed in the lungs by Rodrik. Upon his defeat, Gryff begins to whimper and pleads to Rodrik for mercy, in which Rodrik can either behead him or let him bleed out while taunting him for being a coward. If Ludd was killed instead, Gryff is later seen entering Ironrath and leading the assault on the castle.

        <key>Gorne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.334.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gorne was a King-Beyond-the-Wall of the Free Folk, a title he shared with his brother Gendel.
            Gorne and Gendel invaded the North by leading an army through ancient caves below the Wall. After being forced to retreat, they took a wrong turn and were lost forever. According to legend, their descendants are still down there looking for a way out.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Gorne was joint King-Beyond-the-Wall with his twin brother Gendel, three thousand years before the War of the Five Kings. The two gathered the Free Folk and led them through a cave path beneath the Wall that would later be called "Gorne's Way". Gendel and Gorne's host evaded the Night's Watch, but when they emerged, the King in the North was awaiting them and attacked them. Gorne slew the King, but the King's son took his crown and slew Gorne. While the battle raged, the Night's Watch emerged from their castles and took the Free Folk in the rear.
            According to northern tradition, Gendel was also killed in battle, as he was surrounded by all sides: Starks to the south, Umbers to the east and the Watch to the north. However, the Free Folk believe that Gendel survived the battle and, cutting his way through the ranks of the Night's Watch tried to return beyond the Wall through they same route the wildlings had come through. However, Gendel did not know the way as well as Gorne and he and his followers got lost trying to find their way out. The Free Folk believe that during the night the sobs of Gendel's children can still be heard and that those who venture into the caves and go too deep will be devoured by them.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gorne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGorne</string></dict>
        <key>Hot Pie</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.335.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hot Pie is an orphan and baker's apprentice who was part of the batch of Night's Watch recruits that left King's Landing with the disguised Arya Stark. They were later attacked and captured by Lannister soldiers and taken to Harrenhal, until the only three survivors - Arya, Hot Pie, and Gendry - managed to escape. After his time spent accompanying Arya while a fugitive from the Lannisters, he parted ways to take up the safer life of a new job as a baker for the Inn at the Crossroads.
            Hot Pie is an orphan living in King's Landing and working for a baker as an apprentice. He was born and grew up in the city.[1]
            Hot Pie and Lommy Greenhands are recruited to join the Night's Watch. They bully Arya Stark when she joins their group and demand she give up her sword, Needle. Hot Pie claims that he killed a boy once by kicking him to death. When Arya refuses and threatens to kill him like she has with other "fat boys", he backpedals and bumps into Gendry, who scares him off.[2]
            Hot Pie is travelling north on the Kingsroad with Yorenâs recruits.[3] Gold Cloaks from King's Landing come upon them looking for Gendry. Yoren intimidates them into leaving but they promise to return with more men. Later, Arya, Hot Pie and Lommy Greenhands wash cook pots in the stream while Gendry fills a pail with water. Lommy says that they should yield if the gold cloaks return, not wanting to be caught in a battle. Hot Pie claims that he is unafraid of battle and Arya questions his courage. Hot Pie claims to have seen lots of battles and Arya calls him a liar. Hot Pie insists that he saw a man stabbed in the neck outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Lommy tells Hot Pie that two men fighting is not a battle. Hot Pie says that they had armor on. Arya questions the relevance of this and Hot Pie says that if the combatants wear armor, it is automatically a battle. Lommy refutes the assertion and Hot Pie wonders what a dyer's apprentice would know about battle. As Gendry returns to refill the pail, Arya tell Hot Pie that Gendry is an armorer's apprentice. She instructs Hot Pie to relay his definition of a battle to Gendry. Gendry asks who told Hot Pie that. Hot Pie claims that he heard it from a knight. Gendry asks how Hot Pie knew he was a knight and Hot Pie again cites armor as deciding the issue. Gendry explains that anyone can buy armor. Hot Pie asks how Gendry knows and Gendry reminds him that he sold armor.[4]
            The group is resting in a barn when they are roused to arms by Yoren and told they are being attacked. Hot Pie and Lommy arm themselves and Lommy picks up Gendry's helm before they rush outside. They are met by Ser Amory Lorch and a force of men loyal to House Lannister. Lorch points out the Gold Cloaks with him and says that they have come for Gendry, a royal bastard. Lorch orders Yoren and the recruits to drop their weapons. Yoren remains defiant and Lorch orders him shot. Yoren fights on but is eventually overwhelmed.[5]
            Seeing their leader killed, Gendry and many of the other recruits join the fight while Hot Pie hides in the bushes. The recruits are quickly defeated and the survivors are taken prisoner. Lorch orders the prisoners taken to Harrenhal. Hot Pie is found in the bushes and is quick to yield. Lommy calls for help from the ground, a crossbow bolt in his left leg. Polliver approaches and asks him if he can walk. Lommy says they will have to carry him. Polliver offers him a hand and then stabs him through the throat, killing him. He tells his companions that Lommy wanted to be carried, drawing a laugh. Lorch pushes over Yoren's corpse and demands that the survivors identify Gendry. Arya says that they have already killed him pointing out the bulls head helm lying next to Lommy.[5]
            Hot Pie, Gendry and Arya arrive at the ruined castle Harrenhal with a column of other Lannister prisoners. Gendry sees the decimated towers and asks what kind of fire can melt stone. Arya tells him that it was dragon fire and Hot Pie asks if there are dragons there. Gendry says that dragons are extinct and Hot Pie wonders what he can smell. Arya says that it is the smell of dead people. Polliver orders them to walk on into the midst of the ruin.[6]
            They are chained in a stockade with many other prisoners. They can hear the sounds of a man being tortured nearby. The screams end and an old woman says that the victim is dead. She is expressionless and reports in a monotone that her captors have tortured her sister, husband and now her son to death. Gendry realizes that they select a new victim each day. Arya asks if anyone survives the torture and the woman does not answer.[6]
            Hot Pie and the prisoners are awoken by Ser Amory Lorch and his men. Ser Gregor Clegane approaches the stockade. Hot Pie says that he is the one who chooses the prisoners and Arya recognizes him. Hot Pie stares at him as he approaches and Arya asks what he is doing. Hot Pie says that another prisoner told him that he always stares at the mountain and is never chosen. Hot Pie and his new friend stare at Gregor as he surveys the captives. Gregor selects the staring prisoner. Hot Pie wets himself in fear. The prisoner is strapped to a chair by Weasel as the Tickler questions him. He is asked about hidden valuable in his village and the whereabouts of the Brotherhood. A rat is placed in a bucket and strapped to his chest. Weasel heats the bucket to provoke the rat into burrowing through his chest. The Tickler asks who aided the Brotherhood and the prisoner implicates Ganes the butcher and his son. He begs them to stop and the Tickler says that he has been very helpful but continues with the torture regardless. Hot Pie and the other prisoners watch, helpless to stop them.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Hot_Pie</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHotPie</string></dict>
        <key>Gregor Forrester</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.336.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Gregor Forrester, the Lord of Ironrath, was lord of House Forrester and a bannerman of House Glover, who are in turn loyal to the great house of the North, the Starks.
            Lord Forrester is the Lord of Ironrath and a bannerman of House Stark. As a youth, he famously arm-wrestled Galbart Glover for the privilege of becoming the man's squire; Glover later joked that he'd gladly lose the match all over again, for Gregor was a talented warrior. Gregor married Elissa Branfield, a daughter of Southron Targaryen loyalists, before Robert Baratheon seized the Iron Throne Gregor ascended to the lordship after his father died at the Trident, and has led House Forrester for sixteen years. [1][2]
            He is the father of six healthy children borne by Elissa Forrester: Rodrik, Asher, Mira, Ethan, Talia and Ryon.
            It was later revealed that Gregor also fathered two secret bastards, Josera Snow and Elsera Snow. He sent them to the North Grove for unknown reasons. Their mother's identity is unknown and none of his family are aware of their existence. [3]
            One day, while supplicating at Ironrath, Duncan Tuttle struck up an unlikely friendship with Gregor, the then heir to House Forrester. The two grew close, sharing food, drink, and women, and when Gregor became lord he named Duncan his castellan. [4]. After seeing his exploits in the Greyjoy Rebellion, Lord Forrester asked Ser Royland Degore to serve as Ironrath's master-at-arms.[5]
            At the Tourney at Lannisport, Gregor met Tyrion Lannister, and the two struck up a brief conversation, during which Tyrion found him very honorable, and even then he didn't trust Roose Bolton.[6]
            His son Asher had always been a rebellious youth, finding ways to raise his father's ire. But his life took a dark turn when, at age seventeen, he fell in love with Gwyn Whitehill, the eldest daughter of his father's bitter rival Ludd Whithill. Bloodshed ensued and Lord Forrester faced a grim choice: go to war, or exile Asher across the Narrow Sea. He chose the latter. He privately named that event his life's only regret.[7][8]
            After Robb Stark called his banners to war, Lord Forrester asked Rodrik to stay behind and protect Ironrath; but Rodrik would have none of it. Instead, he rode off at his father's side and led the Forrester cavalry with such valor that his name came to be feared amongst the ranks of Lannister soldiers. [9] When the war began, Ryon was too young to understand why Rodrik and his father were leaving home. [10] Duncan's nephew Gared Tuttle, began to work in Lord Forrester's stables, rising through the ranks to be eventually named his squire. Gared has served Lord Forrester through the long months in King Robb's army.[11]
            Lord Forrester pulls Gared aside and asks him to find Rodrik, as men find courage at the bottom of their cups. He notes Gared as been his squire for several years and asks what he wants for his loyalty. He then offers for Gared to ride in the vanguard along Rodrik's side as an equal of any man who serves House Forrester. He also wishes for Gared to keep it between them because he doesn't want the other squires discouraged.
            After retreating from the battle with Gared, he drops to his knees, proclaiming he is too injured to continue. He orders his squire to return to Ironrath with the Forrester greatsword, and to deliver the message that "The North Grove must never be lost." to Gared's uncle Duncan.
            Lord Forrester's lifeless body is seen on a corpse cart along with several other bodies, including his son, Rodrik who has somehow managed to survive the slaughter of the Freys.

        <key>Greizhen mo Ullhor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.337.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Greizhen mo Ullhor was a slave-trader in the city of Astapor, on the coast of Slaver's Bay.
            Greizen mo Ullhor is of the Good Masters, the ruling elite of the city. He is an immensely wealthy slaver who has grown rich from the training and trading of the Unsullied warrior-eunuchs.
            Greizhen accompanies fellow Good Master Kraznys mo Nakloz and a third Good Master for negotiations with Daenerys Targaryen and is amused by Kraznys' comments about her. When Daenerys states that she wants to buy not just the fully-trained Unsullied but the slaves in training as well, Greizhen opposes, concerned that if these half-trained warriors fail on the battlefield it would shame Astapor.[1]
            Greizhen is present at one of Astapor's plazas for the conclusion of the transaction with Daenerys: the Unsullied and the half-trained boys in exchange for her dragon, Drogon. He is killed when Daenerys orders the Unsullied to kill all the Good Masters, slave-drivers, and soldiers in the city, sparing only the children, and to liberate all the slaves.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, when Daenerys meets with the Good Masters, one of them, Grazdan mo Ullhor, is hesitant to sell the half-trained Unsullied because, if defeated, Astapor and the Good Masters would be shamed. The name seems to have been changed because Grazdan is a common name in Slaver's Bay.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Greizhen_mo_Ullhor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGreizhenmoUllhor</string></dict>
        <key>Grenn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.338.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Grenn was a ranger in the Night's Watch who joined and trained at the same time as Jon Snow, with whom he became good friends.
            Grenn is a new recruit into the Night's Watch. He is strong but slow-witted.[1] Grenn's father abandoned him, leaving him outside a farmhouse when he was only three years old.[2] He grew up on the farm and had a relationship with a neighboring farmer's daughter in his youth.[3]
            Grenn is a recruit in the Night's Watch training at Castle Black. Grenn, Rast, and Pypar are directed by the Master-at-Arms Ser Alliser Thorne to test Jon Snow's skills in combat. Jon breaks Grenn's nose in the fight.
            Annoyed by Jon's superior attitude, the three of them threaten Jon in the armory, but are encouraged to leave him alone by Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion suggests to Jon that he remember their deficiencies in training compared to his own privileged upbringing. Jon later starts training Grenn and the others in the art of combat, earning their trust.[4]
            Grenn and Pypar have become friends, with the latter teasing Grenn on his slow wit. Grenn agrees to Jon's plan to go easy on the new recruit Samwell Tarly. During practice, he urges Sam to hit him, and promptly falls over screaming from a small tap to explain why he can't continue the fight. Ser Alliser is unconvinced.[5]
            Upon completion of his training, Grenn is assigned to serve amongst the rangers.[6] Pypar and Grenn are among the men who witness the arrival of the bodies of Othor and Jafer Flowers to Castle Black.[7] The dead men return as wights, and Jon saves the Lord Commander from one of them.
            Grenn, Pypar, and the others inspect Jonâs new sword, Longclaw, a reward from the Lord Commander.[8] Grenn, Pypar, and Sam ride after Jon when he chooses to abandon his post at Castle Black after the death of Eddard Stark. They talk to him, reciting their oaths, and convince him to return.[9]
            In the far North, the great ranging of the Night's Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont traverses the Haunted Forest. They have passed six abandoned wildling villages and have been travelling for months. Jon Snow passes the sledge housing their ravens. He asks Samwell Tarly if he is having a hard time, and Sam responds that nothing has killed him. Grenn is trying to push the sledge through the mud and complains that Samâs weight damaged it. Sam counters that Grenn offered him a ride, and Grenn says that he only did so because he was fed up of Sam's complaints about his blisters. Eddison Tollett watches the bickering pair. Jon dismounts and leads his horse towards the wooden hall known as Craster's Keep. Edd stands beside him and deadpans that he was born in a similar place but that he has now fallen on hard times. Sam joins them and notes the women working around the hall, asking if they are girls. Sam says that he has not seen a girl for six months, and Edd warns the younger men not to speak to them. Grenn wonders if Craster does not like people speaking to his daughters, and Edd says that they are also his wives, explaining that Craster marries his daughters and breeds more daughters with them. Sam and Grenn state their disgust, and Edd counters that while all the other wildlings in the area have disappeared, Craster is still present, so he must be doing something right. Jon wonders what happens to Craster's sons. Lord Commander Jeor Mormont meets with Craster and learns that the wildlings have gone further north on the orders of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder. The Lord Commander accepts Craster's offer of shelter and his condition that the men do not touch any of his wives.[10]
            Having reached the fortified summit of the Fist, the rangers prepare their camp. They are digging through the snow and unloading their gear. Ghost has rejoined the party and watches the men work from atop a mound of snow. Sentries dot the edges of the summit. Sam is amazed at being in such an ancient place, telling his companions that it was fortified by the First Men in the Long Winter thousands and thousands of years earlier. He considers all of the major historical events that have happened since in wonder, including the invasion of the Andals and the conquering of Westeros by House Targaryen. Edd implores Sam to stop talking. Sam asks what his companions think the First Men were like. Edd suggests that they were stupid, saying that no clever man finds himself in a place like the Fist. Jon suggests that their distant ancestors were afraid and came to the First to escape something. He says that he does not believe that it worked.[13]
            A horn sounds, halting the rangers. Grenn listens intently and wonders if it is a warning about the Wildlings. Jon pauses before saying that a single blast is for rangers, returning while wildlings would have triggered two blasts. Edd notes the horrible moment after one blast on a horn when you must stand and wait, wondering if a second blast will announce foes. Sam adds that three blasts are used to signal White Walkers. Jon turns to look at him, and he explains that it has been a thousand years, but the horn is only blown three times for White Walkers. Grenn asks how Sam knows if so much time has passed. Sam begins to say that he read it in a book, but Edd pre-empts and mimics his answer. Jon says that he can see Qhorin approaching. Edd says that they will live another day, punctuating his monotone with a sarcastic cheer.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Grenn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGrenn</string></dict>
        <key>Gregor Clegane</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.339.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Gregor Clegane is a knight of House Clegane, the older brother of Sandor Clegane, and a notoriously fearsome warrior, with a tendency toward extreme and excessive violence. Due to his huge size, he is called "The Mountain That Rides" or more often simply "The Mountain."
            Ser Gregor Clegane is the head of House Clegane, a knightly house from the Westerlands, and the elder brother of Sandor Clegane.Â When Sandor and Gregor were children, Gregor held his brother's face in a fire for playing with one of his toys without permission, horrifically scarring him.[1] Gregor is a landed knight rather than a full-fledged lord. Gregor is monstrously huge, said to be the largest man in Westeros. He is feared throughout Westeros with a reputation for ferocity and anger. He is a loyal retainer and servant of House Lannister, particularly to Lord Tywin.[2]
            Numerous servants have gone missing at the Clegane keep over the years, apparently killed by Gregor for minor slights in one of his infamous fits of rage, and their deaths then covered up. Gregor's own father and sister died under dubious circumstances as well, and Sandor thinks that Gregor may have killed them as well. Their sister died when Sandor was too young to remember her well, and their father died years later in what was said to be a "hunting accident". At the request of Tywin Lannister, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen himself anointed Gregor as a knight, a great honor, even though Gregor was an infamously dishonorable man.[3]
            During Robert's Rebellion, one year after Prince Rhaegar knighted him, Gregor participated in the Sack of King's Landing. After entering the Red Keep he viciously killed Rhaegar's two children by Elia Martell: their daughter Rhaenys and baby Aegon. He killed baby Aegon by bashing his head against the wall, and then while still covered in the gore from her children proceeded to rape Elia, after which he killed her. It is rumored that he killed her by cutting her in half with a single swing of his massive sword,[4][2] although he later claimed to have "smashed her head in".[5]
            Despite pleas by Ned Stark, neither Gregor nor Tywin were punished by King Robert for the murders of the royal family, leading to a rift in Ned and Robert's friendship.[6][3]
            Ser Gregor takes part in the tournament to celebrate Eddard Stark's appointment as Hand of the King. He kills Ser Hugh of the Vale in a joust, horrifying the crowd. Littlefinger tells Sansa Stark that Gregor burned his brother Sandor's face over a naked flame when they were boys because Sandor borrowed one of his toys without asking. He tells her that few people know the story and not to let Sandor Clegane know that she does.[1] When Gregor faces Ser Loras Tyrell, he loses the joust because Loras chose to ride a mare that was in heat to distract Gregor's stallion. Flying into a rage, Gregor demands his sword, then ruthlessly decapitates his erstwhile mount before the entire horrified crowd. Ignoring his surroundings, he continues to knock the surprised Loras off his horse, and is on the verge of dishonorably killing him, when his brother Sandor intervenes, fighting him off to protect Loras. The two brothers violently trade swings with their swords, and Gregor only stops when King Robert himself shouts to stop the fight, at which the incredibly enraged Ser Gregor stops and leaves.[7]
            Catelyn Stark takes Tyrion Lannister into custody on suspicion of the attempted assassination of her son Bran.[1] In response Gregor is dispatched to raid the Riverlands, her homeland. Refugees from the Riverlands attend court in King's Landing and report that a huge knight who could take the head of a horse in one blow led the attack and had sacked their villages. Littlefinger asks "Remind you of someone?"Â Eddard Stark sends Ser Beric Dondarrion with a hundred men to bring Gregor to justice. Eddard declares him a false knight and strips him of all ranks and titles, lands and holdings, and sentences him to death.[8] The ruling is made null by Eddard's arrest for treason and subsequent beheading.[9]
            The host led by Lord Beric clashes against Ser Gregor at the Mummer's Ford. Ser Gregor is victorious, and Lord Beric is reported dead.[10][11]
            However, when Robb Stark's victory against Jaime Lannister forces Lord Tywin to withdraw his forces to Harrenhal, he orders Ser Gregor to take five hundred men and "set the Riverlands on fire" from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork.[12]
            Gregor continues to raid the villages of the Riverlands from the Lannister army's base at Harrenhal. His men torture the prisoners they take for information about the Brotherhood and hidden valuables. He selects the prisoners for torture personally. Ser Amory Lorch adds a group of captured Night's Watch recruits to the captives. Lord Tywin Lannister arrives during the torture and asks Gregor what is going on. Gregor says that they were not expecting Tywin for another day. Tywin asks why the prisoners are not in their cells. Gregor says that their cells are overflowing. One of Lorch's men interjects that the prisoners will not be there long. Tywin asks if they are so well manned that they can afford to discard able and skilled prisoners. He asks a prisoner if he has a trade and learns that he is a smith. Tywin orders the prisoners put to work, sparing the young man.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gregor_Clegane</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGregorClegane</string></dict>
        <key>Gerold Hightower</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.340.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Gerold Hightower was a knight of House Hightower and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard under King Aerys II Targaryen.
            Ser Gerold Hightower's entry in The Book of BrothersÂ mentions several events of his life. Among them are his injury defending the honor and property of Princess Elia Martell; granting temporary command of the Kingsguard to his sworn brother Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning.Â The Book also mentions that he was sent to locate Prince Rhaegar Targaryen in the wake of Robert's Rebellion, and his death along with Ser Arthur near the Red Mountains of Dorne fighting a small force led by Eddard Stark after refusing to bend the knee to the new king, Robert Baratheon.[1]
            In Bran Stark's vision of the events at the Tower of Joy, Ser Gerold Hightower fights alongside his fellow Kingsguard, Ser Arthur Dayne, against Eddard Stark, Howland Reed and four other Northmen. Before they commence battle, Ser Gerold declares that Robert Baratheon, who he calls "the Usurper", would have perished instead of Prince Rhaegar at the Trident if he and Arthur had been there. He does not say the same about Ned, even though he fought on the opposing side. Though Ser Gerold manages to kill one of the Northmen, he is slain shortly thereafter by Ned.
            Down in King's Landing, the Hand of the King Kevan Lannister objects to his nephew Jaime attending a small council meeting. Jaime counters by stating he has a position there, given he is the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Cersei then asks Pycelle to vouch for his presence there, and the Grand Maester brings up the precedent of Gerold being on the Council during Aerys II's reign.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Gerold Hightower was known as "the White Bull" for his immense strength. He was Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during the brief reign of King Jaehaerys II and then under King Aerys II.
            Gerold Hightower was blindly loyal to the Mad King, no matter how cruel and bloodthirsty Aerys was. He was present when Aerys executed Rickard Stark and his son. He noticed that Jaime Lannister was uncomfortable and inwardly disapproving (from Jaime's thoughts in a POV chapter) of thus unjust atrocity and told him, "You swore a vow to guard the king, not to judge him."
            As Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Gerold indeed had a regular seat on the Small Council.
            During Robert's Rebellion, Prince Rhaegar left Ser Gerold and his fellow Kingsguard Ser Oswell Whent and Ser Arthur Dayne to guard Lyanna Stark at the Tower of Joy near the Red Mountains of Dorne. After the Battle of the Trident, Eddard Stark and six companions arrived to rescue Lyanna and were confronted by the Kingsguard. Despite it being apparent that the Targaryens had lost the war, Ser Gerold refused to surrender, insisting that "the Kingsguard does not flee." In the fight that followed, all three Kingsguard were slain, along with five of Stark's friends. Only Stark himself and Howland Reed survived. It is unclear exactly who killed Ser Gerold. Lord Stark later had the tower demolished and used the stone to make eight cairns, in honor of the eight who died there. It is possible that the TV Show merged the characters of both Ser Gerold and Ser Oswell, as Ser Gerold was supposed to have been much older than the other two knights. Yet, in the show he appears of age with Ser Arthur.

            Gendel and his brother Gorne, who shared the title of King-Beyond-the-Wall with him, led an invasion of the North but were defeated by the combined efforts of House Stark and the Night's Watch.[1] Trying to return beyond the Wall through caves and tunnels deep in the earth they took a wrong turn and were lost. According to legend their descendants are still down there looking for a way out.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Gendel was joint King-Beyond-the-Wall with his twin brother Gorne, three thousand years before the War of the Five Kings. The two gathered the Free Folk and led them through a cave path beneath the Wall that would later be called "Gorne's Way". Gendel and Gorne's host evaded the Night's Watch, but when they emerged, the King in the North was awaiting them and attacked them. Gorne slew the King, but the King's son took his crown and slew Gorne. While the battle raged, the Night's Watch emerged from their castles and took the Free Folk in the rear.
            According to northern tradition, Gendel was also killed in battle, as he was surrounded by all sides: Starks to the south, Umbers to the east and the Watch to the north. However, the Free Folk believe that Gendel survived the battle and, cutting his way through the ranks of the Night's Watch tried to return beyond the Wall through they same route the wildlings had come through. However, Gendel did not know the way as well as Gorne and he and his followers got lost trying to find their way out. The Free Folk believe that during the night the sobs of Gendel's children can still be heard and that those who venture into the caves and go too deep will be devoured by them.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gendel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGendel</string></dict>
        <key>Garth Gardener</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.345.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Garth Gardener, also known as Garth Greenhand, was a legendary King of the First Men in the Age of Heroes. He was the founder of House Gardener and the first King of the Reach. According to legend, Garth Greenhand wore a crown of vines and flowers and was said to make the land bloom.
            King Garth's line ruled the Reach until the Targaryen conquest, becoming extinct with the death of Mern IX, the last King of the Reach. Nevertheless, several of the noble houses of the Reach, such as House Tyrell and House Florent, claim their descent to Garth Greenhand.[1][2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, half of the great noble Houses from the Reach claim descent from Garth Greenhand and House Gardener, of which House Tyrell and House Florent are the most prominent. Other powerful noble Houses in the Reach descended from Garth are House Rowan and House Oakheart. Because House Tyrell never ruled as kings, and because they are only one of several Houses that claim descent from Garth (and not even as close a descent as the Florents possess), they have always felt somewhat uneasy in their claim to dominion over the Reach.
            A large number of Garth's successors were named after him. There were ultimately at least twelve kings of the Reach named Garth, including the original, as there is mention of a coin minted during the reign of "Garth XII".
            The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook expands on the legends of Garth Greenhand, and make it clear that, like most most characters from the Age of Heroes, they all very old, unverifiable, and contradictory, to the point where the maesters pay little historical credence to them. In many versions, he is the father or ancestor of not only the Reach's major Houses, but the Great Houses of the other Kingdoms as well â Brandon the Builder is said to be one of his many sons. Garth is also sometimes equated with the First King (the hypothetical first First Man to declare himself a king over a portion of Westeros).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Garth_Gardener</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGarthGardener</string></dict>
        <key>Garibald Tarwick</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.346.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Garibald Tarwick is the Lord of House Tarwick.
            Garibald was present at the Tourney at Lannisport, where they danced all evening, drank wine from their helmets, and enjoyed food. He considers himself a traveler, having once fought for the Sealord of Braavos, lived in Volantis for a time, traveled to Slaver's Bay once, which he describes as 'sweaty'.[1]
            Lord Tarwick was invited to the royal wedding. While there, he is seen conversing with Lord Morgryn before talking to Sera Durwell, who hoped to marry a suitable noble.
            Later, on their way to the throne room, Sera describes Garibald to Mira Forrester, stating he has a funny accent.[2]
            Lord Tarwick is accompanied to Tommen's coronation feast by Sera, joking along. Once Sera sees Mira, she tells Tarwick she will meet him inside, and he goes in.
            Once the two handmaidens enter the feast, Garibald greets the two, commenting that he had hoped Sera had not run off with Mira, although he would not blame her if he did. Sera formally introduces the two. Tarwick states that Mira is quite lovely. He remarks about it is quite a feast, but jokingly states to be careful around the wine, and depending if you did or did not drink the wine with Sera in episode 2, he will either state that he heard Mira didn't partake in that, or that she's partial to a particular Arbor red. Mira briefly stares at Sera before returning her attention to Tarwick.
            He states that nothing you do in King's Landing goes unnoticed, before he is interrupted by another man, who waves to him. Garibald quickly folds his arms and turns around, ignoring him. Sera questions what that was about, but Tarwick refuses to disclose, believing not fit for her delicate ears, and the two laugh at it while Mira stares at Andros and Rickard Morgryn arguing. While Mira leaves to go investigate who is helping Lord Whitehill, Tarwick begins to tell Sera a story about the Tourney at Lannisport, but Sera interjects, reminding him that he told her that story before, but he continues, reminiscing how they danced all evening, drank wine from their helmets, and the food.
            If Mira eavesdrops on Sera and Tarwick, she can hear Sera telling a joke to Tarwick, with which she finds terrible even though she is telling the joke about a cock. When talked to, he warmly greets Mira, and asks if Mira has had any luck. Mira is confused at this, and he cites if Mira was eavesdropping or talking to anyone, and assumed she was on the lookout for a husband. Sera comments that is not really what Mira is interested in, but Garibald dismisses this, believing she must have her eye on someone. Mira can name some men, including Garibald himself, and gain information on them.
            When Andros yells at Mira for talking with Lyman Lannister, Tarwick looks on concerned. With Lady Margaery Tyrell's arrival, and Sera joining her, Garibald comforts her on the scene she just caused. Mira states she can handle Lord Andros, but Tarwick responds that it was Lyman he was worried about. Mira is confused about this, and tries to press further, but Tarwick admits it is not a story fit for a maiden's ears.
            Mira wishes to learn more, so Tarwick asks about Sera's family. He notes how her name, Sera Durwell, is interesting because the last Durwells went extinct 200 years ago. He asks Mira what she could tell him about her family. Mira can either lie to Lord Tarwick, mentioning that she met the Durwells while she was at Highgarden, or admit that Sera is a bastard and that the Tyrells renamed her. He then tells Mira about how Lyman Lannister was involved in an accident at the tourney at Lannisport, where he fell from his horse and need milk of the poppy for weeks to keep him from screaming, and he continues to drink it to this day. He states that he learned it from Andros, whose mouth is bigger than the Blackwater. If Mira lied, Tarwick states that he has some arrangements to make. If Mira revealed the truth, he instead states he has some arrangements to undo.[3]
            If you lied to Tarwick, Sera mentions that now that he and she are discussing marriage, she can't risk being associated with Mira, and that Mira knows how much Sera needs the marriage.
            If you told the truth to Tarwick, Sera will instead mention that now Garibald is refusing to talk to her, she cannot risk being associated with Mira because Margaery is her only protection without Garibald.[4]
            Tarwick appears in this episode if Mira lied to him about Sera's parentage and refused Morgryn's marriage proposal. He attends Mira's execution alongside Sera and watches as she is beheaded.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Garibald_Tarwick</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGaribaldTarwick</string></dict>
        <key>Gared Tuttle</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.347.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gared Tuttle was the squire of Lord Gregor Forrester. Following the Red Wedding he avenged the murder of his family and was sent to the wall by his uncle Duncan Tuttle so that he was safe from the wrath of the Whitehills. He became a ranger of the Night's Watch but was forced to abandon it after Gared killed Britt Warrick for killing his family. With the help of Cotter Gared escaped Castle Black in order to find the North Grove. After escaping Castle Black Gared then reunites Cotter with his sister Sylvi who could take him to the North Grove. After dealing with wildlings and wights, Gared reaches the North Grove only to be attacked by a bear being controlled by Lord Gregor's warg bastard son Josera Snow and meets both him and his sister Elsera Snow and learns the secrets of the North Grove.
            Gared was born to a family of pig farmers and he was raised on stories of heroism about the likes of Arthur Dayne and Symeon Star-Eyes. Despite his low birth Gared had always aspired to one day be come a warrior himself.
            Gared then got his chance to follow this dream with the help of his uncle Duncan, who had risen from lowborn origins to become Castellan of Ironrath and a close friend to Lord Forrester. Gared then found work in house Forrester where he had started out as a stable boy and where had befriended Bowen a squire to Norren one of lord gregor's man at arms. Despite all of his origins Gared had eventually rose up and became Gregor's squire and served him faithfully. Gared has served Lord Forrester throughout the long months in King Robbâs army, and is ready to be a warrior in his own right.[1]
            Gared is present at the wedding of Edmure TullyÂ andÂ Roslin Frey, also known as the Red Wedding. Gared enjoys as one of the Forrester men, Norren, tells stories about the Battle of the Whispering Wood and the capture of Jaime Lannister. Fellow squire Bowen reminds him that Lord Forrester's sword needs cleaning. Finally, Lord Gregor emerges from his tent and joins the conversation between the Forrester men. Bowen notices he is holding a cup and notifies Gared should get him some wine. After this, Lord Forrester asks to speak with him. Gared is promoted and is told that he will fight tomorrow, but that for now he needs to go and find his first-born son Rodrik Forrester. Gared and Bowen make their way to get wine and encounter some of Walder Frey's men.
            After listening to the soldier at the pump making comments about the wedding, Gared notices that there is something going on. He notices the Frey men's crossbows by their seats, the Frey men in a tent loading them, and finally The Rains of Castamere playing. Panicking, Gared is given choices to make Bowen hurry which in turn alerts the soldiers to his knowledge.
            After this, Gared is given a choice; to run from Bowen and save Lord Forrester or to save Bowen. If Gared runs to Lord Forrester, Bowen is stabbed in the neck by a Frey soldier. He is then forced to dodge swords and maces, crawls under a burning cart and wrestles with a soldier. He gets to Rodrik but is only able to watch as he is stabbed and killed by Frey soldiers. Once Gared gets to Lord Forrester he is asked where Rodrik is, and Norren asks him where Bowen is. If Gared chooses to save Bowen he pulls him away from the soldiers and the two of them run away. Gared goes through the same sequence as before and still watches Rodrik die.
            Gared then finds Lord Forrester and if Bowen lives he can be seen stabbing a soldier in the back and also advancing upon the group of soldiers along with Norren, Lord Forrester and Gared. The three/four attempt to fight the group but Gared is knocked down by a soldier, after which Lord Forrester saves him. Lord Forrester is then hit by a crossbow bolt in the chest, and he and Gared are instructed to run by Norren.
            Once Gared and Lord Forrester make it to the edge of the Frey's camp Lord Forrester falls to the ground due to his wounds. Gared is commanded to journey on with the Forrester greatsword and return it to his son, Ethan Forrester who will be the new Lord of Ironrath. Gared accepts, but before he leaves Lord Forrester also asks him to tell his Uncle Duncan Tuttle the Castellan of Ironrath that "The North Grove must not be lost." and to tell nobody else. Gared once again accepts.
            Gared is then seen wandering down the Kingsroad, presumably on his way to Ironrath. He sees blood on the road and is given the opportunity to examine, as well as being able to examine other objects such as a dead pig and an overturned cart. Gared then sees three soldiers harassing his father, who is tied to a post. The lead soldier is heard saying "Roose Bolton shall have his bacon." They see Gared and instruct him to "move along" as there is "nothing to see here." However, Gared sees his father and advances toward them. At this point he is given the chance to move to his father or draw his sword. Both choices end in the same way, Gared fights the three men. At first, Britt, a Whitehill soldier, takes Lord Forrester's sword from Gared, and Gared is made to choose between two weapons; a pitchfork or an axe. After choosing one Gared either impales the pitchfork in a Bolton soldiers' neck or hacks into his neck with an axe. He then fights for the greatsword back, is stabbed in the leg by the Britt and dodges attacks from another Whitehill soldier and is given the choice to show him mercy or kill him. As the choices suggest, the Whitehill soldier either walks away or is killed by Gared. Britt escapes on his horse regardless of the choices made.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gared_Tuttle</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGaredTuttle</string></dict>

When Ray claims that he has nothing of true value to give them and that he has many mouths to feed, they leave, and possibly were responsible for the slaughter of everyone, except for Sandor Clegane. [1]
            MorganÂ andÂ GatinsÂ educateÂ Brotherhood Without BannersÂ Members SteveÂ and Riddell as to how to best kiss a girl. According to Gatins, this is best done by sticking one's middle finger up the rectum while kissing.

        <key>Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.349.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun  was a Free Folk Giant who resided at HardhomeÂ before being saved by Jon Snow and taken south of the Wall.Â He is more commonly referred to by the other Free Folk as "Wun Wun".
            Wun Wun is a Giant, the only one known to reside in Hardhome and possibly the last giant in Westeros following the deaths of Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg and Dongo during the Battle of Castle Black.
            Wun Wun is present when Jon Snow and Tormund Giantsbane battle against the White Walkers. Wun Wun appears willing to support Tormund casting his vote simply by stating Tormund's name. Later, when the Night's Watch is gathering the dragonglass that Jon shared with the free folk, as it can kill the White Walkers, Wun Wun is holding a dragonglass arrowhead, and Eddison Tollett approaches to tell the giant to give it up, though he is too afraid to do so because of his intimidating size. Wun Wun gets annoyed by his inaction and asks "The fuck you looking at?" in the giants' rudimentary form of the Old Tongue, so Edd goes away quietly, without collecting the arrowhead, Wun Wun may still possess this piece of dragonglass.[1]
            When the Wights attack the village, Wun Wun single-handedly defeats about a dozen of them by ripping them apart, stomping on them, and defending himself with a large burning log. He then retreats into the sea with Jon and the remaining defenders. Being too large for the rowboats, he simply wades out into the bay for a long distance (not drowning due to his great height) to reach the larger ships waiting off shore. He is among the few free folk to escape the Massacre at Hardhome, and the fleet travels back to the Wall.[1]
            Alongside the other wildlings, he passes the Wall and leaves Castle Black to settle in the Gift. Many brothers of the Night's Watch are intimidated by him, having never seen a giant before.[2]
            Wun Wun and Tormund lead the free folk in an attack on Castle Black, this time to save Jon's body and his few loyalists from the mutineers. Wun Wun breaks down the gates and intimidates the brothers into quickly surrendering, only killing one black brother after he foolishly (and futilely) shoots the giant in the back with a crossbow. After Tormund orders the brothers to stand down, Wun Wun witnesses Ser Alliser and Olly being taken into custody for their role in the mutiny and the murder of Jon Snow.[3]
            When Jon, Sansa and Tormund attempt to recruit the wildlings, Wun Wun is present and is the first to cast his vote by saying 'Snow'.[4]
            Wun Wun is on the front lines of Jon's army fighting against Ramsay Bolton and his forces at Winterfell. During the battle, after Jon's cavalry enters the fight and Ramsay's archers stop, Davos leads Wun Wun and his archers in a charge, as they cannot fire from their current position without hitting their own men. Wun WunÂ fights until they are surrounded by Smalljon Umber and the Bolton army. Wun Wun uses his colossal strength to try and tear through the infantry line, but despite making a few noteworthy kills, he is outmatched by the rows of enemy pikes. He appears significantly weakened by his injuries. However, Petyr Baelish arrives with the Knights of the Vale, his aid having been finally accepted by Sansa.
            Ramsay's forces are decimated by the Vale cavalry and he retreats to Winterfell, reassuring his men that the opposing army lacks the resources to lay siege. Moments later, being in the vanguard to reach Winterfell, Wun Wun uses the last of his strength to breach the fortress's wooden doors with his bare hands, and then is riddled with arrows by the few remaining Bolton archers. At that point, the Starks and Arryns reach Winterfell and proceed to clear out the remaining Boltons. Wun Wun falls to his knees, bloodied, injured and exhausted from the battle, as yet more bolts and arrows are fired into him. As he looks at Jon, who reaches out to him, he is shot in the eye by Ramsay Bolton, killing him, as Jon and Tormund watch helplessly. Enraged, Jon furiously beats Ramsay to a pulp but stops after noticing Sansa standing over them. Wun Wun is avenged when Ramsay is taken prisoner, and after a barbed exchange with Sansa, he is fed to his own starving hounds.[5]
            It is currently unknown if Wun Wun was the last of his kind, or if giants still exist somewhere beyond the Wall. In the opening episode of Season 7, Dragonstone, a horde of wights led by White Walkers, includes a few giants who have been converted to wights.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun is at least fourteen feet tall, even larger thanÂ Mag the Mighty, and possesses the strength of twelve men.Â Whilst typically passive and quiet, he will lash out if provoked.Â Unlike the savage giants in Old Nan's stories, he is vegetarian. He speaks theÂ Old Tongue.
            Along with someÂ wildlings, Wun Wun is discovered by Jon SnowÂ when he leads new recruits to theÂ weirwoodÂ grove in the Haunted Forest. With the help of some diplomacy by the new wildling recruitÂ Leathers, they avoid a fight and manage to convince the wildlings and the giant to return with them toÂ Castle Black.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Wun_Weg_Wun_Dar_Wun</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWunWegWunDarWun</string></dict>

            Ser Vance, along with Lord Yohn Royce and Lady Anya Waynwood, sits on a tribunal to investigate the death of Lysa Arryn. Like the other judges, Ser Vance assumes foul play on Littlefinger's part. During the tribunal, Ser Vance is made aware that Petyr Baelish's niece, "Alayne", is actually Sansa Stark, but he agrees to keep her secret and accepts her testimony that Lady Arryn committed suicide.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character named Ser Vance Corbray. There are two known Corbray knights, brothers to Lord Lyonel Corbray, Ser Lyn and Ser Lucas. Ser Lyn is a noted warrior, and is also known to be a homosexual. Vance is most likely based off Lyn, as he was the Corbray present at the meeting betweenÂ Petyr Baelish and the Vale lords.
            Lord Yohn Royce and the other present Vale lords do not inquire about Lysa's death, but demand that Littlefinger leaves the Vale and lets them look after Lysa's son. During the conversation, Lyn Corbray comments "All this talk makes me ill. Littlefinger will talk you out of your smallclothes if you listen long enough. The only way to settle his sort is with steel". He draws his sword. The lords are shocked and embarrassed at that improper behavior, and apologize to Littlefinger. That puts them in a defensive position, which Littlefinger takes full advantage of, to make them grant him one year of wardship over Robert Arryn.
            After the lords leave, Littlefinger reveals to Sansa that Lyn Corbray is on his payroll, as she suspected. He pretends to be Littlefinger's implacable enemy, thus fooling the Vale lords.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Vance_Corbray</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascVanceCorbray</string></dict>

        <key>Galbart Glover</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.354.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Galbart Glover was the Lord of Deepwood Motte and a loyal bannerman to House Stark. He concurs with Robb Stark that Stannis Baratheon is the rightful king, but later joins in declaring Robb the King in the North.
            Galbart Glover is the Lord of Deepwood Motte and the head of House Glover, a vassal family to House Stark of Winterfell. He is known as a loyal and reliable bannerman.
            Gregor Forrester famously arm-wrestled Galbart Glover for the privilege of becoming the man's squire; Glover later joked that he'd gladly lose the match all over again.
            Galbart Glover dines with Robb Stark and his bannermen as they assemble their armies to march south to confront the Lannisters and free Lord Eddard Stark. Jon Umber objects to Glover being placed in command of the vanguard in the order of battle, to the point of threatening to leave and take his troops with him. Robb Stark's direwolf, Grey Wind, rips off two of the Greatjon's fingers in response. The Greatjon laughs off the incident and accepts his place in the army. Later, Galbart Glover joins Robb's strategy meetings as the army marches onward.[1]
            Following the victorious Battle of the Whispering Wood, Robb holds a meeting with his generals as they decide whether to accept Renly or Stannis Baratheon as king. Galbart angrily says that Renly is not the true king, agreeing with Robb's assertion that Renly is the younger brother. A few minutes later he joins the Greatjon and other lords in declaring Robb as the King in the North.[2]
            Galbart's brother, Robett Glover has become the Lord of Deepwood Motte - suggesting that Galbart has either died, or is presumed dead. Robett mentions Galbart in past tense to Sansa Stark after she and Jon Snow try to gain the support of House Glover for their impending attack on the Boltons. However, Robett dismisses them when his loyalty to the Starks is questioned - justifying it by reminding them that Galbart had sworn for Robb when he was lord and Robb led all his men to their deaths.[3]
            In A Song of Ice and Fire, Galbart Glover is the head of House Glover of Deepwood Motte. Their lands are deep in the Wolfswood to the north-west of Winterfell and extending along the coast of the Bay of Ice, south of Bear Island. Galbart is noted as a good lord and a loyal vassal. Being childless, his heir is his younger brother Robett.Â Catelyn considers him a good man, loyal and steady, but without her uncle's brilliance.
            Galbart is a part of Robb Stark's war council when the latter calls his banners. He participates the Battle of the Whispering Wood and the Battle of the Camps. He is in attendance when Robb is proclaimed King in the North.
            When news reaches Riverrun of Robett Glover's capture at Duskendale, Galbart fears for his brother's life. It is partly that fear that causes Robb to trade Martyn Lannister (who was not killed in the books by Rickard Karstark) for Robett. Galbart is named the commander of Robb's scouts and outriders.
            Before going to the Red Wedding, Robb commands Galbart and Maege Mormont to take men by longship and sail through the marshes of the Neck to seek out Howland Reed, thus they do not attend the Red Wedding. He gives them letters for the Northern lords, explaining the letters contain false orders, in case they are captured by the Ironborn. While it is not explicitly written, it is speculated by fans that Robb also gave Maege and Galbart the royal decree he issued, by which he legitimized Jon Snow and named him his successor.
            It is unknown whether Maege and Galbart reached their destination, and if they actually have Robb's decree in possession, or even if they are still alive. In the fifth novel, Alysane Mormont (Maege's second daughter) implies that her mother is alive, but no such hint is given in respect of Galbart.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Galbart_Glover</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGalbartGlover</string></dict>

            Gared is a ranger in the Night's Watch.
            Gared is a ranger of the Night's Watch. He is an older, more experienced ranger and a capable soldier. He is beheaded by the White Walkers while on a scouting mission beyond the Wall in the Haunted Forest with Will and Ser Waymar Royce.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Gared is past fifty and has lost both ears, his left little finger and three toes to frostbite. His brother died to the frostbite while he were on duty. He has been on the Wall for over forty years. Gared dosen't like his commander Sir Waymar Royce because he flattens him. Gared has watched many insignificant lords come and go at the Wall in his past forty years as a ranger. Gared is a veteran amongst the rangers. He has over one hundred scouting missions beyond the Wall at the Haunted Forest.
            Some of Gared and Will's roles have been switched around from the books; in the book it is Gared who escapes and is executed for desertion.
            In the book, Theon kicks Gared's severed head and laughs. Jon disapproves of that.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gared</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGared</string></dict>

            After Harren and his line were burned alive by Aegon the ConquerorÂ and hisÂ dragon inside his castle of HarrenhalÂ during theÂ War of Conquest, the ironborn were expelled from the Riverlands back to the Iron Islands. In exchange for their allegiance, Aegon allowed theÂ ironborn to choose their new leader. They chose Vickon Greyjoy: his House was one of the most prominent in the Isles, claiming descent from the legendary Grey King. However, he was made Lord of the Iron Islands, not a King. Because of this, the Kingsmoot continued to just crown Vickon's descendants as their leader. [1]

        <key>Wyman Manderly</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.357.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Wyman Manderly is the head of House Manderly, a prominent Northern house, and a powerful bannerman of House Stark. He was the second to declare Jon Snow the King in the North after the Battle of the Bastards and names him the White Wolf.
            Lord Wyman Manderly fought in the War of the Five Kings for King Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. However, after his son and heir, Wendel Manderly, was slain at the Red Wedding, he withdrew his forces from the future conflict and remained at White Harbor to ensure no more Manderly lives would be at risk.
            House Manderly plays no role in the Battle of the Bastards, having refused summons from both House Stark and House Bolton to keep his house and vassals from suffering more deaths from the War of the Five Kings. After Jon takes Winterfell, Wyman and the other Northern lords arrive to treat with him, and get berated by Lady Lyanna Mormont for not upholding their oaths of allegiance to House Stark despite the crimes committed against them and their families at the Red Wedding. Wyman is consequently the first lord to declare Jon Snow the new King in the North and the first to call him the "White Wolf".[1]
            In theÂ A Song of Ice and FireÂ novels,Â Wyman ManderlyÂ is the head of House Manderly. He has two sons, WylisÂ andÂ Wendel, and has been a widower for eight years. His titles include Lord ofÂ White Harbor,Â Warden of the White Knife,Â ShieldÂ of theÂ Faith, Defender of the Dispossessed,Â Lord Marshal of the Mander, andÂ KnightÂ of theÂ Order of the Green Hand. He participated in theÂ Battle of the TridentÂ duringÂ Robert's Rebellion.
            Wyman is so fat he can no longer ride a horse and must be carried in a litter, leading to the disparaging nicknameÂ Lord Too-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse.Â He is nearly sixty years old, with a massive belly and fingers the size of sausages.
            Wyman is amiable and has a loud, booming laugh. He is mocked by his own people asÂ Lord Lamprey.Â By his own admission, and because of his physical appearance, Wyman is seen by many as craven and foolish, however, this is a clever front; he is in reality a shrewd, calculating and intelligent man, and a staunchly loyal supporter ofÂ House Stark.
            Wyman's heir, SerÂ Wylis, is captured by the MountainÂ in the battle of the Green Fork, and is held prisoner at Harrenhal. He and many other northern captives are freed when Vargo Hoat betrays the Lannisters and helps Roose Bolton take Harrenhal. Later, Wylis is captured again by the Mountain at the battle of the Ruby Ford due to Roose Bolton's treachery, and again is imprisoned at Harrenhal.
            Wyman's second son, SerÂ Wendel, is killed at theÂ Red Wedding.
            Wyman wishes to get even with those who are responsible for Wendel's death, but cannot act against them openly as long as Wylis is held by the Lannisters. It does not mean he has given up vengeance, because, as he says, "the North remembers."
            Wyman's apparent submissiveness make people think he is a spineless coward. According to Lord Godric Borrell, the Freys have brought Wyman a bag of his dead son's bones, and in return he has made a pact with Lord Frey, and even agreed to seal it by wedding his granddaughters to Lord Frey's grandsons. Godric comments disdainfully "Had it been my son, I would have returned the courtesy and thanked the Freys before I hanged them, but the fat man's too noble for that". As things turn to be, Wyman has more "sophisticated" plans for a payback.
            Prior to the Battle of Castle Black, Stannis sends Davos to the White Harbor, to gain the support of the Manderlys. Davos is accepted with open hostility at the court of Lord Manderly. He reminds Wyman the death of his son, but then one of the attending Freys, Ser Jared, tells the Freys' version of the Red Wedding: Robb and his followers warged into wolves, and the Freys acted in self defense. Brazenly, Jared claims that Wendel was killed as he shielded Lord Frey with his body. Davos is stunned at the enormity of the lie, which Wyman seems to believe.
            Wyman's younger granddaughter Wylla supports Davos: she states that Robb was their king, the Freys murdered him, and if Stannis is ready to avenge him - they should join him. She also reminds what Ramsay Snow (she deliberately calls him that, even though he has long since been legitimized) did to her father's cousin Lady Hornwood, and she will never accept Ramsay as Lord of Winterfell. Lord Wyman hushes her, and her mother drags her away. Then Wyman orders Davos to be arrested and executed.
            Davos is thrown to jail, where he is kept for days, though in rather comfortable conditions. Unbeknown to him, Wyman executes a criminal who generally resembles Davos, and reports to King's Landing that Davos is dead. Cersei is convinced that Wyman has proven his loyalty sufficiently and orders Wylis released and sent to the White Harbor. Jaime, on his way to Riverrun, escorts Wylis to White Harbor.
            Davos is surprised when Robett Glover comes to his cell and takes him to a secret room where Wyman and a mute youth are standing. Wyman apologizes for his rudeness but explains to Davos that is was all a show - to fool the Freys and Lannisters - but he remains loyal to the Starks, as they gave House Manderly refuge when they were exiled from the Reach centuries ago. Now that Wylis is back home safely, he can take action against those who are responsible to Wendel's death. He introduces the mute as Wex, Theon Greyjoy's former squire who was among the ironborn in Winterfell but was not killed or captured by the Boltons. Wex followed Rickon and Osha after they left Wintefell, and once he discovered their destination, he made it to the White Harbor and told Wyman. Wyman tells Davos he is willing to join Stannis, on condition that Davos rescues Rickon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Wyman_Manderly</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWymanManderly</string></dict>
        <key>House Greyjoy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.358.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>House Greyjoy of Pyke is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It rules over the Iron Islands, a harsh and bleak collection of islands off the west coast of Westeros, from the castle at Pyke. The head of the house is the Lord Reaper of Pyke.
            House Greyjoy's sigil is traditionally a golden kraken on a black field. Their house words are "We Do Not Sow," although the phrase "What Is Dead May Never Die" is also closely associated with House Greyjoy and their bannermen, as they are associated with the faith of the Drowned God.
            House Greyjoy had been in open rebellion against the Iron Throne since the War of the Five Kings, during which it sought independence for the Iron Islands once more. However, following the death of King Balon Greyjoy and the election of his brother, Euron, as the new King of the Iron Islands, House Greyjoy was divided between Euron and his followers, and Balon's surviving children, Yara and Theon, and their followers. Yara's faction, which had aligned with House Targaryen, was defeated by Euron, who has aligned himself with House Lannister upon the beginning of Daenerys Targaryen's invasion of Westeros.
            House Greyjoy is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. Their lands are the Iron Islands off the west coast of the continent. They rule from their castle Pyke from the island of the same name. The Iron Islands are harsh and bleak and the Greyjoys have traditionally survived by raiding their neighbors. They have always had plans to conquer the mainland. The head of the house is the Lord Reaper of Pyke.[1]
            House Greyjoy boasts descent from the Grey King, a legendary King of the Iron Islands said to have ruled for a thousand years and taken a mermaid as his wife. Like the vast majority of ironborn, they worship theÂ Drowned God.[1]
            Lord Balon Greyjoy was the founder of the Kingdom of the Iron Islands. He led a rebellion against King Robert Baratheon eight years before the events of the series begin. Balon's sons Rodrik and Maron were killed in the unsuccessful rebellion. Balon's only surviving son Theon was made a ward of Lord Eddard Stark to ensure Balon's submission to King Robert.[2] Only his daughter, Yara Greyjoy, and two of his brothers remained on the Iron Islands after his defeat.[3]
            At some point, Balon exiled his younger brother, Euron Greyjoy, who became a feared pirate that terrorized the seas as far as from Oldtown in Westeros to Qarth in Essos.[4]
            Theon Greyjoy is a ward of Lord Eddard Stark. He lives at the Stark castle of Winterfell, where he has a cordial relationship with his Stark hosts.[5] Despite the respectful treatment accorded by the Starks, Theon is insecure about his status as a ward. He boasts of his status as a lord to Osha, a Wildling servant in the Stark household, but fails to intimidate her.[6] He later accompanies Ned's son Robb Stark, the King in the North, to fight in the War of the Five Kings and wins Robb's trust and favor.[7]
            Theon appeals to King Robb to send him on a mission to negotiate an alliance with his father, Balon Greyjoy, reasoning that the Starks would need ships to attack King's Landing. Despite Catelyn Stark's distrust of Balon, Robb relents and sends Theon back to the Iron Islands to secure help.[8] However, Balon has other ideas and plans to use the power struggle on the mainland to carve up a kingdom in the North, once more declaring himself King of the Iron Islands. Theon is torn between his birth family and his loyalty to the Starks, but ultimately chooses to submit to his father. Theon decides to renege his allegiance to the Starks and is baptized in the name of the Drowned God while his father and sister watch on.[9]
            Balon's daughter, Yara Greyjoy, leads a large force that attacks Deepwood Motte, the seat of House Glover.[9] Meanwhile, Theon is made the commander of the Sea Bitch. Instead of attacking small fishing villages as ordered, Theon and his men raid Torrhen's Square and succeed in drawing the remaining Stark forces away from Winterfell.[10] Without consulting Balon or Yara, Theon and his men seize Winterfell and capture Ned's younger sons Bran and Rickon Stark. Theon also executes Ser Rodrik Cassel for defying him. However, the two Stark boys and their Direwolves escape with the help of Osha and Hodor.[11]
            In retaliation, Theon murders two orphans and claims them as Bran and Rickon.[12] His actions have the effect of fuelling northern hostility towards the Ironborn invaders. Balon and Yara are furious with Theon's conduct, which has jeopardized the Ironborn war effort. Yara leads a party to implore her brother to leave Winterfell. Theon refuses and insists on defending his prize against the northerners. Unable to reason with Theon, Yara is forced to leave him behind.[13]
            Theon and his paltry garrison are besieged by a large Bolton army led by Ramsay Snow, the bastard son of Roose Bolton, a vassal of the Starks. The Ironborn turn on Theon and hand him over to Ramsay in return for safe conduct.[14] However, Ramsay reneges on his offer and flays them alive. The capture of Theon is a major blow to House Greyjoy since it deprives Balon of his last remaining son and heir to the Seastone Chair.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Victarion_Greyjoy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascHouseGreyjoy</string></dict>
        <key>Wendel Manderly</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.359.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Wendel Manderly was the son and heir of Lord Wyman Manderly, a knight and a member of House Manderly of White Harbor, loyal vassals of House Stark.
            Ser Wendel is part of the retinue that accompanies King Robb Stark to the Twins for the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey. During the wedding feast, Ser Wendel sits besides Ser Brynden Tully and Black Walder Frey. Following the bedding of the newlyweds, Wendel is murdered, shot with a quarrel through the back of his head and out his mouth. He dies along with his King and the rest of the Stark bannermen.[1]
            When all the Northern lords are gathered in Winterfell after it is taken back by the Starks, Lyanna Mormont reminds Wendel's father Wyman Manderly that his son died at the Red Wedding and yet he refused to aid the Starks. Wyman acknowledges this but promises to make amends and joins in declaring Jon Snow the new King in the North.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Wendel Manderly is the second son of Lord Wyman Manderly, the Lord of White Harbor and Warden of the White Knife. He is not quite as fat as his father and older brother, but is still considered immense. He is loud and boisterous, wears a large mustache and is bald.
            Wendel was killed in the book somewhat differently to the show: when the massacre started, he rose to his feet, but an arrow went in his open mouth and came out the back of his neck, killing him instantly. He did not have a chance to resist or surrender.
            Lord Wyman Manderly hates the Lannisters and the Freys for his son's death. He cannot act openly against them as long as his other son Wylis is held captive by the Lannisters, but he secretly plots to join Stannis and avenge Wendel's death. Once Wylis returns home, Lord Wyman makes an offer to Davos: he will join Stannis on condition that Davos will travel to Skagos and finds Rickon Stark.
            Lord Wyman brings three huge piesÂ to Ramsay's wedding, and serves them to the Boltons and the attending Freys. It is speculated those pies are made of three Freys (Rhaegar, Jared and Symond) who stayed for a while at the White Harbor, and disappeared without a trace on their way to Winterfell - a payback for Wendel's death.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Wendel_Manderly</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWendelManderly</string></dict>
        <key>Brynden Tully</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.360.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Brynden Tully, popularly called "the Blackfish," was a knight and a member of House Tully. He was the younger brother of Lord Hoster Tully, and the uncle of Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure Tully.
            After the massacre of the Northern army at the Red Wedding and the death of Robb Stark, the Blackfish reassembled the remnants of the Tully host and retakes Riverrun from House Frey, becoming the de facto leader and lord of House Tully during his nephew's captivity. Refusing to surrender his family home to the Freys, he was killed in a final stand when Jaime Lannister retakes the castle.
            Brynden Tully is the younger brother of Hoster Tully, Lord of Riverrun and head of House Tully, and the uncle of Catelyn Stark, Edmure Tully, and Lysa Arryn. Brynden is a respected knight and formidable battle commander, who first distinguished himself in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, nearly forty years before the War of the Five Kings.
            Brynden often argued with his older brother Hoster, particularly over the fact that Brynden never married. When Brynden returned home from the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Hoster had already arranged for him to marry Bethany Redwyne, of the wealthy and powerful House Redwyne. Brynden refused this generous match, however, refusing to be told when and whom to marry. Hoster was angry that Brynden would not do his duty to their family and enter into a marriage-alliance to improve their fortunes, and said that he was the black goat of the Tully herd. Brynden joked that given that the Tully sigil is a trout, it would be more fitting to say that he was the "black fish" of the Tully school. The nickname stuck, and Ser Brynden became popularly known as "The Blackfish" ever since. Brynden even took to using a black fish in his own personal heraldry, which like the standard Tully heraldry it uses a red and blue background, but swaps out the normal silver trout for a black one. Hoster would attempt to contract other arranged marriage-alliances for Brynden over the years, many of them very promising matches, but Brynden turned down them all, which led to constant bickering between the two brothers throughout their lives.
            Despite his disagreements with his brother over his refusal to marry, Brynden is very devoted to his family.
            The Blackfish brings Rickard Karstark and his men before King Robb after they brutally murder Willem and Martyn Lannister as revenge against House Lannister. Brynden is highly offended when Rickard makes a derogatory comment about Ned Stark and punches him in the face in retaliation. Brynden counsels King Robb not to execute Lord Karstark but instead to keep him as a hostage, thus keeping the Karstark forces loyal to the Starks. King Robb disagrees, however, and executes Lord Karstark under charges of treason while Brynden watches on along with Edmure, Talisa and Catelyn.[2]
            En route to the Twins for Edmure's wedding, Brynden agrees with Catelyn that Walder Frey is the prickliest man he has ever met, and quips that he has seen "wet shits I like more than Walder Frey".[4]
            Roose Bolton and Walder Frey later discover that The Blackfish escaped. Though Frey is undisturbed, Roose is visibly concerned that Brynden will reach the safety of Riverrun before he is found.[6]
            Petyr Baelish informs Sansa Stark that Brynden has reunited the remnants of the Tully army and successfully taken back Riverrun from House Frey, and he advises her to seek her uncle out for help retaking the North. Heeding this advice, Sansa sends Brienne of Tarth to meet with Brynden.[7]
            Lord Walder Frey berates his sons for losing Riverrun, and requests help from the Lannisters in taking it back, thus beginning the Second Siege of Riverrun.[8] While parleying with Jaime Lannister, the Blackfish informs him that Riverrun can hold out for two years, and that he must be ready to lose thousands of men if he wants to storm Riverrun. Realizing that the Blackfish has no intention of surrendering, Jaime is furious that he had to meet him at all.[9]
            Later, Brienne of Tarth arrives with Sansa Stark's letter, asking the Blackfish to send his forces North to join Sansa and Jon's army. The Blackfish refuses to give up Riverrun, even for his great-niece. Edmure is sent to retake the castle from the Tully garrison, under threat of the murder of his son. The Blackfish knows that Edmure is not coming of his own free will, and orders the men not to let him in. Though the Blackfish commands the forces at Riverrun, formal authority is vested in Edmure as the rightful head of House Tully and the Lord of Riverrun, and his men are obliged to obey Edmure, not the Blackfish. As his men allow Edmure into Riverrun, a disheartened Blackfish leaves the battlements. Edmure orders his men to surrender and that his uncle be put in chains, but the Blackfish refuses to surrender and resolves to kill as many men as he can. He leads Brienne and her squire Podrick Payne into a waterway to escape Riverrun on a boat. He stays to die fighting for his home, though he admits he'll "probably make a fool" of himself due to a lack of recent combat experience.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Brynden_Tully</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBryndenTully</string></dict>

            Following the fall of House Stark at the Red Wedding, Britt, and other men sworn to House Whitehill are tasked with suppressing further Northern rebellion, and ensuring the loyalty of other Northerners to Roose Bolton, the new Warden of the North. He and two other soldiers move onto Forrester land and kill Gared Tuttle's sister, as well as mortally wound his father. Gared soon arrives at the scene after escaping the Red Wedding, and upon seeing his dying father, attacks Britt and the other two men with Gregor Forrester's sword. Britt quickly disarms him and commands his companions to kill the squire, but Gared manages to defeat them and kills one or both of them depending on the player's choices. Britt then flees the scene on horseback, swearing that Gared will hang for his actions.
            Britt later accompanies Ludd Whitehill to Ironrath to demand justice for Gared's killings, and tells Lord Ethan that the squire attacked him and his men for no reason.Â He is last seen scowling at Ethan as the Whitehills leave the Forrester stronghold.[1]
            Britt first appears in this episode when Frostfinger is announcing the new recruits at The Wall. He and Gared have a brief verbal confrontation before being separated by Frostfinger.
            Atop the wall during Gared's shift, Britt joins him after leaving the elevator and attempts to taunt and infuriate him. Whether Gared is enraged or not the two then fight using several weapons at their disposal. He comments that if Gared's father could fight like him he would still be alive and the fight inevitably leads to Britt being severely maimed by Gared. Britt is last seen by Finn either bleeding to death, being finished off by Gared or being kicked off the wall.
            Britt's corpse is burned to prevent him from becoming a wight.

            Brusco is a bouncer living in Braavos.
            When Lanna enters the brothel to sell oysters, Brusco tells her to leave, but Lhara convinces him to let her stay.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Brusco is a fishmonger, and doesn't work at a brothel. The Kindly Man describes him as "a good man with a bad back". Brea (who appears as a prostitute in the show) is his eldest daughter in the novels. He has one more daughter namedÂ Talea, and at least two sons. He is sparing with his words and his coin.
            Some time after Arya arrives at the House of Black and White, the Kindly Man orders her to work for Brusco, as a part of her apprentice. Arya does well selling his merchandise (oysters, clams, crabs, mussels, cockles, sometimes prawns). During her work she befriends many people, learns the Braavosi tongue and hears many secrets. After she kills Dareon, she brings Brusco his purse and boots. Brusco does not ask her where she got those.
            During the period that Arya is blind, she misses Brusco and his daughters a lot. After she is given her eyesight back, she returns to work for Brusco, as if she had never been away.
            In Arya's sample chapter ("Mercy") of the sixth book, it is revealed Brusco is one of the actors at Izembaro'sÂ theatre. He plays the role of the boar in the play "The Bloody Hand".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Brusco</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBrusco</string></dict>

            Bharbo was a revered Khal amongst the Dothraki. He is the father of Drogo.
            Rakharo tells Ser Jorah Mormont that his father was a bloodrider to Khal Bharbo and was a great warrior.[1] When Khal Drogo vows to cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms in response to the attempted assassination of his pregnant wife, Daenerys Targaryen, he swears by his father's name.[2]
            Bharbo is briefly mentioned when Daenerys is taken before Khal Moro - again specifically in reference to his son as "Drogo, son of Bharbo".[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Bharbo is mentioned in the same way as in the TV series; Drogo refers to him when swearing to retake the Iron ThroneÂ for Daenerys and for their son Rhaego.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bharbo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBharbo</string></dict>

            He is a member of the Thenn, a tribe of Free Folk known for their practices of ritual self-scarification and cannibalism. He is also a warg, capable of entering the minds of animals to see through their eyes and control their actions. He is bound to an owl, allowing him to act as a scout for Styr, the Magnar of Thenn.
            Having already scaled the Wall and raided a village in the Gift, the Thenn warg locates Tormund and Ygritte's group through his owl and leads Styr and the rest of his warband to them.[1]
            On top of the Wall, the warg's owl spots the signal fire created by Mance Rayder. He tells Styr and Tormund that the time has come to attack Castle Black. The Thenn warg fights alongside his wildling allies during the battle.Â After killing a black brother, he sees and chases down Samwell Tarly, who shoots him in the head with a crossbow.[2] As Jon enters the chambers where Tormund is being held, Jon mentions that the bodies of the fallen wildlings were going to be burned, and later this warg's body was burned along with the other slain wildlings.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, even though there are several skinchangers in Mance Rayder's army (Orell, Varamyr Sixskins, Borroq), there is no mention of one among the Thenn.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Thenn_warg</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascThennwarg</string></dict>
        <key>Vardis Egen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.365.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Vardis Egen was the captain of the guards at the Eyrie. In Tyrion Lannister's trial by combat, he was the champion for Lysa ArrynÂ and was killed by Bronn, who fought for Tyrion.
            Vardis Egen was captain of Jon Arryn's personal guard in King's Landing and then became captain of the guards in the EyrieÂ for Robin Arryn and his mother, Lysa Arryn. He is a knight of some reputation, but is no longer a young man.
            Vardis leads the group of knights who meet Catelyn Stark and her prisoner Tyrion LannisterÂ before she enters the Eyrie.[1] Lysa orders Tyrion imprisoned in the sky cells. After having spent quite some time in a sky cell,Â TyrionÂ finally claims that he wants to confess his crimes and then demands a trial by combat. Though many men, including Lord Eon Hunter and a Knight of House Lynderly, offer to fight as Lysa's champion, she asks Ser Vardis to represent House Arryn. At first he says that fighting Tyrion would be unfair, but Vardis accepts when Tyrion asks that he be represented by a champion. The sellsword Bronn offers to be Tyrion's champion. Vardis fights dressed in full metal armor and carrying a large and heavy wooden shield. His speed and dexterity were easily outmatched by Bronn, who wore only a leather armored shirt. During the course of the fight, Bronn throws things into Ser Vardis' path and even trips him, while quickly dodging and weaving to avoid Vardis' attacks. Ultimately Bronn tires out the more heavily armored knight, severely injuring him with a quick slash and disarming him.
            Bronn waits for Lysa Arryn to call for mercy, but she does not respond, so he stabs Vardis in the neck and pushes him through the "Moon Door" in the center of the throne room, sending him down a thousand-foot drop. Lysa snaps angrily to Bronn that he didn't fight with honor. The sellsword agrees, before pointing to the Moon Door and noting that Ser Vardis did, which is effectively what got him killed.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Vardis Egen is an extremely loyal servant and retainer of House Arryn. He had been the captain of the guard when Jon Arryn was Hand of the King. He is described as heavy, square, plain-faced, silver-haired, and having no humor. In the battle with Bronn, Vardis is not only quite a bit older and slower than Bronn, but Lysa has given him Jon Arryn's great sword to defend the honor of the House, which is a heavier and unfamiliar blade. He has one young son.
            In the book, Bronn kills Vardis without pushing him out of the Moon Door (which is set in the wall, not in the floor).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Vardis_Egen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascVardisEgen</string></dict>

        <key>Bowen Marsh</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.368.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bowen Marsh  was the First Steward at Castle Black, a senior position within the Night's Watch.
            Bowen Marsh is the First Steward of the Night's Watch, based at Castle Black. He is in charge of the day-to-day running of the Night's Watch, dealing with issues of supplies, funding, logistics and communications. He hails from House Marsh, a noble crannogmen family of the Neck sworn to House Reed.
            After the assignment ceremony, Maester Aemon orders Pyp to report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.[1]
            Marsh is present when Mance Rayder is executed by Stannis Baratheon for refusing to bend the knee.[2]
            Marsh participates in the Choosing of the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He stands among Alliser Thorne's supporters, and fails to applaud or cheer when Jon Snow is elected.[3]
            At a later meeting in the Night's Watch, Marsh sits alongside Jon, Thorne and First Builder Othell Yarwyck and openly opposes Jon's proposal to allow the wildlings access through the Wall to settle in the Seven Kingdoms or even join the Watch itself. Samwell Tarly cites The Gift as a good place for the wildlings to settle because much of the farmland there is deserted, but Marsh reminds him that this is because the wildlings frequently targeted the lands of the Gift in their raids of the North, citing Olly's village as an example.[4]
            When Jon Snow returns from Hardhome with thousands of wildlings and lets them in through the Wall, Bowen Marsh is among the many black brothers who look at the wildlings and even their Lord Commander with disgust.[5]
            Marsh later takes part in and helps organize a mutiny against Jon Snow, as many Black brothers feel that he has forsaked the Night's Watch for the wildlings. After tricking Jon into being trapped in a corner, Marsh is the third to stab Jon, after Alliser Thorne and Othell Yarwyck, though he looks somewhat remorseful while uttering "For the Watch". He and the mutineers then leave Jon for dead as the sun rises.[6]
            Thorne openly admits that he orchestrated Jon's murder, and Marsh was one of the conspirators. Marsh is present when Thorne threatens to kill Jon's loyalists if they refuse to surrender by nightfall.[7] Come nightfall, Marsh is among the mutineers who try to break into Jon's quarters, stopped only when Eddison Tollett returns with the wildling army. With the Night's Watch outnumbered, Edd orders the mutineers arrested for their treachery. Marsh is subsequently dragged off and locked in an ice cell.[8] Following Jon's resurrection, Marsh and the mutineers are sentenced to execution by hanging for their treason. He openly tells Jon that he shouldn't be alive, while Jon counters that the mutineers shouldn't have killed him. He dies when Jon cuts the rope that triggers the hanging.[9]
            During the first season it was believed Brian Fortune was playing Marsh, andÂ Dennis McKeever was playing Othell Yarwyck, based on comments made by Fortune and McKeever's character delivering one of Yarwyck's lines from the books. However, this assumption was then dispelled: McKeever reappeared in Seasons 2 and 3 in the Great Ranging, even though Yarwyck didn't participate in the books; in Season 4, Fortune's character was identified as Yarwyck; and Michael Condron was subsequently cast as Marsh for the fifth season, which means Fortune's character was always Yarwyck, while McKeever was simply playing an unnamed Night's Watch officer.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Bowen Marsh first appears in the first book, A Game of Thrones. He is described as being red and round, leading Dolorous Edd to nickname him "the Old Pomegranate". He is is an important senior figure in the Watch, reporting directly to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and is just below him in the command hierarchy of the Watch.
            Dolorous Edd, Mance Rayder and Cotter Pyke have the same opinion about Marsh: that he is more skilled in counting than fighting.
            When Mormont and the rest of the Night's Watch ride out to investigate the wildling menace in the so-called "Great Ranging", he remains in command at Castle Black. Though not explicitly stated, Bowen Marsh hails from House Marsh, a noble house from the Neck sworn to House Reed.
            In A Storm of Swords, as the wildlings advance to Castle Black, Mance Rayder sends raiding parties to attack several areas of the Wall, in order to draw attention away from the main host and to split the defenders. Unfortunately, Marsh falls for the trick and takes most of the garrison from Castle Black. When Jon Snow returns, he finds that only forty-one men are left in the castle, most of them old, crippled, or inexperienced.
            In the novels, Marsh is friendly with Jon Snow. In A Dance with Dragons, he staunchly supports Jon when he is elected as the new Lord Commander, but slowly becomes disillusioned with him when he proposes an alliance with the wildlings, personally reminding him that what he is proposing is nothing less than treason towards the Watch. When Jon decides to leave Castle Black to seek out and kill Ramsay Bolton, who apparently sent Jon a threatening letter, it is Marsh who instigates the mutiny against Jon instead of Alliser Thorne. He is the second to stab Jon, with tears in his eyes.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bowen_Marsh</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBowenMarsh</string></dict>

        <key>Boros Blount</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.371.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Boros Blount is a member of the Kingsguard and defends King Joffrey Baratheon as he defended King Robert Baratheon before him.
            Ser Boros is a member of House Blount, a noble house from the Crownlands.
            Ser Boros was among the guards that attacked Eddard Stark when he tried to de-throne King Joffrey.[2] He was also present when Ser Barristan Selmy was dismissed from the Kingsguard.[3]
            During the Battle of the Blackwater, Ser Boros and Ser Mandon Moore remain at the side of King Joffrey as he oversees the city's defenses alongside Tyrion Lannister, the Hand of the King. When Queen Cersei learns that the forces of Stannis Baratheon have almost breached the walls, she orders Joffrey to be brought into the safety of the Red Keep. When told that he has to leave the wall at the behest of Queen Cersei, Joffrey, who has never shown much courage in the face of adversity, complies and orders Ser Mandon and Ser Boros to aid Tyrion and fight on in his stead. They stand behind Tyrion as he gives a speech to rally the troops. [4]
            Ser Boros, along with his three sworn brothers, is present at the Great Hall when Tywin Lannister presents himself before King Joffrey.[5]
            During the feast to celebrate the wedding of Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark, King Joffrey taunts Sansa by telling her that he may rape her, and have Ser Meryn and Ser Boros hold her as he does it.[6]
            Ser Jaime goes over the security plans for the Royal Wedding feast with Ser Meryn Trant, mentioning the place in which Ser Boros will be stationed[7]
            After King Joffrey's assassination, Cersei chastises Ser Jaime for posting only Ser Boros outside Tommen's door, and commands him to have four men guarding the future king day and night.[8]
            Five members of the Kingsguard escort King Tommen Baratheon to the steps before the Great Sept of Baelor so the king can meet with the High Sparrow. Members of the Faith Militant block them.[9]
            Boros Blount has a more prominent role in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels. In the TV series he is merely a background character, and many of his lines and actions are given to his fellow Kingsguard Ser Meryn Trant. Blount is a member of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard. He is a short-tempered, ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs. He has a flat nose, jowls and grey hair. Ser Jaime Lannister considers him an angry paper shield. Many characters throughout the series think of Blount with contempt due to the man's cowardice. Like Trant, Varys considers him one of "Cersei's creatures".
            Boros, along with the other five Kingsguard members present, openly laughs when his Lord Commander Barristan Selmy is unlawfully dismissed from service.
            In the books, it is Boros Blount who carries out Joffrey's orders to undress and beat Sansa Stark instead of Ser Meryn. He's also absent during the Battle of the Blackwater, having been dismissed for cowardice after yielding Prince Tommen to Tyrion's agents when the Prince is smuggled out of King's Landing to protect his life from the impending attack by Stannis Baratheon. However, he is reinstated to the Kingsguard by Tywin Lannister upon his return as Hand of the King, to fill the vacancy left by the Hound when he deserted. Jaime thinks that his sister should have never dismissed Boros, but their father only compounded the shame by reinstating him.
            Following Joffrey's death by poisoning, Jaime makes Boros the offical food taster for King Tommen, as he deems him unfit to do anything else. Boros considers this a shameful post for a knight of the Kingsguard, grabs the hilt of his sword and says angrily "You should be the food taster, it seems to me. What else is a cripple good for?" Jaime smiles and challenges Boros to fight him, although he is aware that even fat, aging, and ordinary swordsman like Boros can hack him into bloody pieces. Luckily for Jaime, Boros is too cowardly to accept the challenge. He spits at Jaime's feet and storms outside, but complies in this new role.
            In the trial of Tyrion Lannister, Boros testifies after Meryn Trant, repeating what Meryn said. Whatever dislike Boros harbors toward Cersei for dismissing him from the Kingsguard, he says the words she wants all the same.
            Sansa thinks that Boros Blount is "the worst of the Kingsguard, an ugly man with a foul temper, all scowls and jowls", which is quite an accurate description of him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Boros_Blount</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBorosBlount</string></dict>
        <key>Borros Baratheon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.372.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>LordÂ Borros BaratheonÂ was the Lord of Storm's EndÂ and head ofÂ House Baratheon.
            Lord Borros was the head of House Baratheon during the Dance of the Dragons, the civil war between two factions Blacks and Greens, cadet factions of House Targaryen. After the coronation of Aegon II Targaryen, his mother, Alicent Hightower sent her second son Aemond Targaryen to rally support of their faction, the Greens, in order to gain the allegiance of lords that hadn't already declared for Aegon. Rhaenyra Targaryen, the leader of the Blacks, also sent her second son Lucerys Velaryon to try and gain Borros' allegiance. Aemond arrived at Storm's End first on his dragon, Vhagar, and pleaded his brother's case. By the time, Lucerys had arrive on his dragon, Arrax, Aemond was still there. He pleaded his mother's case. However, Borros had already made his decision, and sent Lucerys away, signifying his allegiance to the Greens. Aemond's artificial sapphire eye cleared at Lucerys, causing him to flee Storm's End and Borros. Aemond would kill Lucerys moments later above Shipbreaker Bay.[1]
            At the start of theÂ Dance of the DragonsÂ both theÂ blacksÂ and theÂ greensÂ hoped to win Lord Borros over to their cause. PrinceÂ Aemond TargaryenÂ hoped to wed one of his four eligible daughters to winÂ House BaratheonÂ over to the greens, and arrived onÂ dragonbackÂ to do so. PrinceÂ Lucerys VelaryonÂ arrived soon after to win Borros to the black cause. Eyewitness accounts varied, with some saying Lord Baratheon was embarrassed for Lucerys to find him treating with Aemond (as Borros's father had been a supporter of PrincessÂ Rhaenys Targaryen), while others say he relished the prospect of both factions competing for his aid.
            Borros refused Lucerys, since Aemond could wed one of Borros's daughters while Lucerys could not as he was betrothed to his cousin,Â Rhaena. Although Borros forbade the kinsmen to fight beneath his roof atÂ Storm's End, he tacitly allowed Aemond to seek combat, knowing the olderÂ VhagarÂ would be able to overcomeÂ Arrax, which would lead to the death of Lucerys.Â As the war began in earnest, Storm's End officially declared for the greens.
            PrincessÂ Jaehaera, daughter of KingÂ Aegon II Targaryen, was sent to Storm's End under the charge of SerÂ Willis FellÂ of theÂ KingsguardÂ whenÂ King's Landing fellÂ toÂ Rhaenyra TargaryenÂ and herÂ blacks.
            Borros kept the armies of theÂ stormlandsÂ out of heavy fighting for most of the war but he eventually tookÂ King's LandingÂ during theÂ Moon of the Three Kings. Borros's army was defeated by theÂ LadsÂ and theirÂ rivermenÂ in theÂ battle of the Kingsroad. Borros is said to have killed twelveÂ knights, along with Lord DarryÂ and Lord Mallister, before falling against LordÂ Kermit Tully.

        <key>Greatjon Umber</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.373.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Jon Umber, commonly called "the Greatjon" due to his large size, was the Lord of Last Hearth, the head of House Umber, and a formidable and proud bannerman of House Stark. He fought for Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings. His role as Robb's chief northern advisor is taken up by Lord Roose Bolton. Despite sometimes standing up against Robb when disagreeing with his decisions, he is fiercely loyal to the Starks of Winterfell, and is in fact the first lord to propose crowning Robb the King in the North.
            Jon Umber is the Lord of Last Hearth and the head of House Umber, a loyal vassal family to House Stark of Winterfell. He is a large, proud, and formidable warrior. He is the father of Jon Umber, who is commonly called "Smalljon" to differentiate the two, and with whom he apparently did not have a very strong relationship.
            Robb Stark sends ravens to the bannermen of House Stark instructing them to assemble for a march south to King's Landing to free Eddard Stark. The Greatjon leads a contingent of Umber troops to join the Stark army assembling at Winterfell. He is furious when Robb appoints Galbart Glover to lead the vanguard of the army during a feast at Winterfell. The Greatjon demands the honor for himself and refuses to follow a Glover into battle, threatening to take his troops home. Robb challenges him by saying that he will arrest him as a traitor on his return from the South. The Greatjon draws his knife and Robb's direwolf Grey Wind barrels down the table and knocks him off his feet. Grey Wind bites off two of the Greatjon's fingers. Robb mercifully offers that The Greatjon drew his knife in order to cut his meat for him and the Greatjon laughs off the incident calling Robb's meat tough.[1]
            Catelyn Stark joins the army at Moat Cailin. The Greatjon vows that they will smash the Lannisters and march on to King's Landing to rescue Lord Eddard. He objects to Robb releasing a Lannister scout from custody, but Robb exercises his authority and the Greatjon reluctantly accepts his decision. The scout had overestimated the size of Robb's forces.[1]
            After hearing of the execution of Lord Eddard, the Greatjon declares that he will never accept any king of House Baratheon as his ruler again, and leads the bannermen of House Stark as well as the Riverlords in proclaiming Robb the King in the North.[2]
            While King Robb Stark invades the Westerlands, Greatjon Umber is tasked with liberating the Riverlands from Lannister occupation. Lord Umber expels the Lannisters from Raventree Hall, then restoring the ancient castle of House Blackwood, and then wins another victory at Stone Hedge, which is then reclaimed by its rightful lord, Jonos of House Bracken.[3]
            The Greatjon is not present at the Twins during the events of the Red Wedding, making him one of the few bannermen of House Stark that survived it.[4][5]
            After Bran decides to travel north of the wall, he sends Osha and Rickon to the holdfast of Greatjon Umber for safety.
            When the Greatjon's son, Smalljon Umber, arrives at Winterfell to hand Rickon Stark over to Ramsay Bolton, he reveals that the Greatjon has died, and Ramsay accordingly addresses the Smalljon as "Lord Umber". He tells Ramsay he might have killed his father himself if he had not "died on his own", implying that his relationship with his father was not a pleasant one.[6] Smalljon then betrays his fathers beliefs and House Umber's previous loyalty to House Stark by offering Rickon and Osha as a gift to House Bolton, to be held as prisoners and used as leverage against the Starks.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jon Umber, dubbed "the Greatjon," is a huge bear of a man, standing slightly under seven feet tall, who makes for a fierce, loyal friend but a savage and dangerous enemy. He is the Lord of Last Hearth, the northern-most castle of the North, barred only the lands held by the Night's Watch. After his initial defiance of Robb in which he loses two of his fingers to Robb's direwolf, he becomes respectful to Robb for standing up to him, and he becomes one of the King in the North's greatest champions and supporters. As in the TV series, it is the Greatjon who first declares that Robb should be crowned king of an independent North, rather than submit to southern kings again. The Greatjon has a son, also named Jon and nicknamed "Smalljon,", and two uncles, Mors and Hother (nicknamed "Crowfood" and "Whoresbane," respectively). "Smalljon" is nicknamed to denote his younger age, not a reference to his size; he is, in fact, almost as large as his father and is noted to still be growing and may even end up larger than his father. In the novels, both Greatjon and Smalljon fight for Robb, and there is no hint of animosity between the two.
            In A Clash of Kings, the Greatjon remains in Robb Stark's army when the King in the North invades the Westerlands, while each Riverlord is given leave to reclaim their own lands from Lannister occupation. In A Storm of Swords, the Greatjon attends the Red Wedding. Merrett Frey was given the task of getting the Greatjon too drunk to fight by engaging him in a drinking contest. Despite consuming a vast quantity of wine and outdrinking his competitors, when the massacre begins, the Greatjon still grabs a sword and fights valiantly. It takes eight men to overcome him, and he kills one and injures two. Even when he can no longer fight with his hands, he fights with his teeth, and bites off half the ear of one of the assailants. The Greatjon is among the few guests who are taken alive by the Freys, while Smalljon is killed by Dreadfort men while defending Robb. He remains a hostage at the Twins to ensure House Umber doesn't rise against the House Bolton or the Iron Throne. As a result, Greatjon's uncle Hother Umber reluctantly bends his knee to the Boltons, but his other uncle Mors Umber joins Stannis in defiance.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Umber_(Greatjon)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGreatjonUmber</string></dict>

            He is a Ranger of the Night's Watch.
            After meeting the force led by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont at the Fist of the First Men, Qhorin selects Stonesnake, Harker, and Borba for a scouting party to ambush a group of wildling lookouts. They are joined by Jon Snow.[1] They locate and surprise the lookouts, killing all but one of them. Jon is left to execute the wildling survivor.[2] Jon does not return and they return for him. They pick up his tracks but are ambushed by wildlings. Harker, Stonesnake and Borba are killed while Qhorin is captured. Jon had spared the captive and she leads him into a similar ambush. Qhorin seizes the opportunity to insert Jon as an infiltrator in the wildling ranks by berating him for the deaths of the others publicly.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character of this name. Qhorin's party includes Stonesnake and Jon Snow as in the show but also features "Squire" Dalbridge and Ebben.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Borba</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBorba</string></dict>
        <key>God-on-Earth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.375.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The God-on-Earth was the legendary first emperor of Yi Ti. According to myth, he was the son of the two major deities in Yi Ti's religion, the Lion of Night and the Maiden-Made-of-Light.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, "God-on-Earth" was the legendary first emperor of the Great Empire of the Dawn - the first empire of Yi Ti back during the Dawn Age, before the Long Night more than 8,000 years ago. The Golden Empire itself is semi-mythical and it is unconfirmed if it truly existed, being filled with emperors who allegedly lived for thousands of years and warred with gods.
            According to the legends told in Yi Ti, God-On-Earth was the only begotten son of their religion's two primary deities, the Lion of Night and the Maiden-Made-of-Light. He allegedly lived for ten thousand years, and traveled about his domains in a palanquin carved from a single pearl and carried by a hundred queens, his wives. At the end of his reign, God-on-Earth ascended to the heavens to join his forbearers.
            He was succeeded by his eldest son, the Pearl Emperor, who allegedly lived for one thousand years. All subsequent rulers of the Great Empire of the Dawn were God-on-Earth's descendants. Eventually, the seventh ruler (known as the Opal Emperor) was succeeded by his daughter, known as the Amethyst Empress - however she was usurped and murdered by her own younger brother, an evil necromancer known as the Bloodstone Emperor. The Maiden-Made-of-Light turned her back on humanity in shame over this betrayal, and the Lion of Night came forth in his wrath to scourge humanity by plunging the world into darkness - which is how the legends of Yi Ti explain why the Long Night happened. The Great Empire of the Dawn (if it ever really existed) collapsed, and Yi Ti had to rebuild its civilization. Yi Ti's current civilization, "the Golden Empire of Yi Ti", was founded a few generations after the Long Night (still nearly 8,000 years ago, the oldest continuous civilization in the world).
            All of the emperors in Yi Ti's subsequent eleven dynasties, between the Long Night and the present, claim descent in one form or another from God-on-Earth, and through him the gods. For this reason the rulers of Yi Ti are referred to as "god-emperors", and worshiped by their subjects as demigods (or actual gods). This is somewhat similar to the real-life title "Son of Heaven", used to refer to East Asian monarchs. For Chinese emperors, the term was understood figuratively (the ruler was a mortal chosen by the gods, but not their literal descendant). In Japan, however, the emperors were literally believed to be descended from the gods - the beliefs in Yi Ti are closer to this.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/God-on-Earth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascGodonEarth</string></dict>

            This White Walker and others of his race lead an army of wights Beyond the Wall.
            As Gilly and Sam are making their way to the Wall, the White Walker approaches them in order to take Gilly's baby. Sam confronts him but the White Walker freezes and shatters his sword by holding it and punches him aside, focusing his attention on Gilly and her unnamed son. The White Walker is then stabbed in the left scapula by Sam with his dragonglass dagger. Unable to reach the blade, the White Walker then desiccates, turns into ice and shatters.[2]
            When Sam returns to Castle Black, some of his brothers do not believe he killed the White Walker and mockingly call him "Sam the Slayer."[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire books, Sam slays a White Walker that attacks him after he falls back from the main column during the march to Craster's Keep. Sam gains the nickname of "Sam the Slayer" both in admiration by those who believe him and in mockery by those who don't. After the murders of Craster and Lord Commander Mormont, Sam and Gilly take refuge at a village that Sam believes to be White Tree, in which they are attacked by the wight of Small Paul, who had been killed by the White Walker.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/White_Walker_(Valar_Morghulis)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascWhiteWalker</string></dict>

        <key>Beric Dondarrion</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.378.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Beric Dondarrion is the Lord of Blackhaven and the head of House Dondarrion. Initially sent out by Eddard Stark to lead a party of men to apprehend Ser Gregor Clegane for atrocities committed against the people of the Riverlands, he and his men then rallied deserters from different armies in the war, as well as commoners trying to defend their homes, to form a guerrilla resistance group known as the Brotherhood Without Banners, with Dondarrion as their leader. After Dondarrion died and was reanimated by the Red Priest Thoros of Myr, Beric and his Brotherhood started believing in the Red God, whom he believed to have a purpose for him. In the war efforts against the Lannisters, Beric was killed five more times and was brought back to life by Thoros each time.
            As the war slowly came to an end, Beric and his remaining members, including the newly-recruited Sandor Clegane, made it their priority to head north to assist in fending off the threat of the White Walkers and the army of the dead - the "true enemy". Beric, Sandor and Thoros joined Jon Snow in an expedition beyond the Wall in which they plan to capture a wight to provide proof of the threat of the undead to the Lords of Westeros. During the expedition, Thoros was killed, which meant that Beric would go through no more reanimations and was thus on his "last life". Their mission a success, Beric and the rest of the group returned back south after being saved by Daenerys Targaryen. Beric remained at the Wall, where he witnessed the White Walkers and the army of the dead breaching it and invading the Seven Kingdoms.
            Beric Dondarrion is the Lord of Blackhaven and the head of House Dondarrion, a vassal house to House Baratheon of Storm's End. He is a young lord who still enjoys the life of a knight, including taking part in tourneys. He is visiting King's Landing when the series begins.
            Upon hearing of the atrocities committed by Ser Gregor Clegane, Lord Eddard Stark, acting as the Hand of the King, orders Lord Beric to take a hundred men, ride to Ser Gregor's keep and execute him for treason and murder. Beric willingly agrees to the task.[1]
            Lord Beric is rumored to have been killed in the Battle at the Mummer's Ford. The survivors form the Brotherhood Without Banners.[2] In fact, Beric is actually killed by the Mountain, who drives a lance through his chest. Thoros of Myr unwittingly resurrects him.[3]
            Dondarrion reunites with Thoros' party at Hollow Hill, the headquarters of the Brotherhood Without Banners, and is surprised to see they have captured Sandor Clegane. Beric reveals he has converted to the religion of the Lord of Light. After Arya Stark accuses the Hound of murder, Beric sentences him to trial by combat as there is no other witness to confirm his guilt, and chooses himself as Clegane's rival.[4]
            Later, Beric reminisces on the times he has been killed with Thoros and Arya. Arya briefly asks if Thoros can revive a man with no head, clearly referring to her father, but Beric merely compliments Eddard's honourable nature and tells her of the side effect of his resurrection: with each revival, he loses some of his memories and is less himself, a life he would not wish on Eddard. The group is later encountered by Melisandre, who seeks out Gendry. Melisandre briefly examines Beric and is clearly astonished at how Thoros has been able to revive him so many times. Against Arya's wishes, Beric sells Gendry to Melisandre for gold, a decision that later leads Arya to abandon them. When Beric informs Arya that they will be delaying ransoming her in order to launch an attack on some Lannister soldiers instead, it is the final straw and Arya flees from the group.[6]
            Arya Stark could not forgive Beric and Thoros for selling Gendry to Melisandre. Later, during her travels with Sandor Clegane, she includes their names when reciting her "death list".
            Remembering how Beric was revived by Thoros six times, Melisandre attempts a ritual to resurrect Jon Snow following his murder, which is successful.
            Beric prepares to hang Lem and two other members for raiding a community that was building a sept, staining the good name of the Brotherhood. However, Sandor Clegane, who had become a member of the community, hunts down Lem and demands he be allowed to kill the man himself, as vengeance for the hanging of Brother Ray. After some arguing, Beric and Thoros allow the Hound to hang two of the men himself, out of respect for the loss of his friend, but refused to allow him to kill them in a barbaric manner. Beric personally hangs the third man. Later on, Beric offers Sandor a place in the Brotherhood, as he needs good men. He says there are "cold winds" rising in the North, and he intends to stop them.[7]
            TheÂ Brotherhood Without Banners travel through thick snow. They decide to shelter for the night at an abandoned village but Sandor thinks it is unsafe.Â Beric DondarrionÂ dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter a hunt where they discover the corpses of theÂ FarmerÂ and his daughterÂ Sally, Sandor and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior, following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Beric_Dondarrion</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBericDondarrion</string></dict>

        <key>Balon Greyjoy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.380.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Balon Greyjoy was the Lord Reaper of Pyke and the head of House Greyjoy. He was the father of Yara and Theon Greyjoy, and the older brother of Euron, and Aeron "Damphair" Greyjoy.
            Balon Greyjoy was the head of House Greyjoy and Lord of the Iron Islands. The Iron Islands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Greyjoy is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Greyjoy rule the region from their seat at Pyke and Balon also holds the title Lord Reaper of Pyke. He was a hard, ambitious and ruthless man.
            Balon was married to Alannys of House Harlaw. They had four children Rodrik, Maron, Yara and Theon. Yara is their only daughter.
            While visiting Winterfell, Tyrion Lannister asks Theon what his father would think if he could see his only surviving son 'playing lackey' to Robb Stark. Theon angrily defends himself, but Tyrion seems to gain the upper hand of the exchange.[4] Later, Theon tells Ros about his father's power and that no family in Westeros, not even the Lannisters, can look down at them. However, Maester Luwin mocks Theon's father's failed rebellion when Theon's boasting gets a little out of hand.[5] When Theon tries to get Osha to call him 'Lord', she points out his father is still alive, so he isn't a lord yet, to Theon's annoyance.[6]
            After the Starks, under Robb Stark's leadership, win several victories against the Lannister army, Theon reminds Robb that they will need to take King's Landing in order to defeat the Lannisters for good, and proposes an alliance between the Starks and his father, who can provide them with ships, though he seems rather uncertain while promising that Balon will listen to him.[7]
            Theon returns to the Iron Islands, hoping to be received with honors, only to find nothing. Theon finds Balon waiting alone in his chambers. He greets him as 'father' and Balon remarks on his nine year absence, saying the Starks took a frightened boy and he wonders what they have given back. Theon says that he is a man and Balon's heir. Balon says they will see and notes that Eddard had Theon for longer than he did. Theon responds that Eddard is gone and Balon asks how Theon feels about Eddard's death. Theon says âwhat's done is doneâ and shows Balon the proposal from Robb. Balon interrupts him to ask who gave him his clothes, wondering if Eddard enjoyed dressing him like a daughter. Theon is baffled and offers to change his clothes. Balon notes the gold clasp of Theon's cloak and reminds Theon of the custom of the Iron Price, saying that Theon should wear only what he has taken from dead foes. He asks if Theon paid the Iron Price for the clasp and when Theon admits that he did not, Balon tears it from his neck. He says that he will not have his son dressed like a whore and throws the clasp into the fire.
            Balon says that Theon's appearance is proof of his fear that the Starks would make Theon theirs. Theon insists that his blood is salt and iron, and Balon counters that Robb has sent him like a trained raven with a message. Theon asserts that he proposed the offer in Robb's message and that Robb sees him as a brother. Balon warns Theon not to name Robb brother in his presence because Robb is the son of the man who killed Theon's true brothers. He asks if Theon has forgotten his origins and Theon insists that he remembers his brothers and the time when his father was a king before handing Balon the message. Balon interprets the offer as Robb giving him a crown in exchange for him defeating Robb's enemies. Theon suggests that he could lead the attack personally.
            A young woman Theon rode with to Pyke and tried to seduce enters and he shouts that he told her to wait outside. He asks how she bypassed the guards and she tells him that anything male is easy to fool before standing beside Balon. Balon greets her warmly and puts his arm around her. Theon realizes that she is his sister, Yara, now grown up. She greets him as brother and says that his is a homecoming that she will tell her grandchildren about. Theon realizes that Balon intends to have Yara lead the attack and says that she is unsuitable as a woman. Balon tells Theon that Yara took over command of his brother Rodrik's ship after Eddard killed him. He clutches his chest and intones a prayer to the Drowned God of the Ironborn âWhat is dead may never die.â Yara joins in and Theon repeats the saying a little slower.
            Balon says that Yara has only ever been off the Iron Islands on a ship and that she has both commanded and killed men. He says that she knows who she is. He burns Robb's letter and says that no-one gives him a crown. He says that he will pay the Iron Price and take his crown because that is who he is and who the Iron Born have always been. Balon and Yara walk out and Theon calls after him, warning that he cannot defeat the Lannisters alone. Balon retorts that no-one said anything about fighting the Lannisters.[8]
            Balon enters his chambers to find his children waiting for him; Yara greets him respectfully. Theon follows suit, a little slower. Balon goes to his table which holds a map of the seven kingdoms and details his plans. He is going to attack the North. He knows that it is poorly defended while Robb is fighting in the Westerlands. He assigns thirty long ships to Yara to take Deepwood Motte. Theon asks his part and Balon says that he will have one ship to raid fishing villages along the Stony Shore. Yara twists the knife by saying that his ship is named Sea Bitch. Theon tries to argue against the whole strategy and Balon accuses him of divided loyalties. Theon claims that he is being pragmatic by avoiding the enmity of their potential ally in Robb. He reminds Balon that Robb will give them Casterly Rock in exchange for fealty. Balon counters by making Theon repeat the House Greyjoy words âWe do not sow.â Balon describes reaving as their way of life and accuses Theon of having become weak living with the Starks. Theon responds by reminding Balon that he gave him to House Stark after his defeat in the Greyjoy Rebellion. He angers Balon with the bitter memory and Balon hits him in the face then begins to storm out of the room. Theon calls after him, pointing out the unfairness of his hatred. Balon pauses as his son harangues him but then strides on. Yara accuses Theon of wanting Balon to bow down to his âother family.â Theon denies seeing the Starks that way.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Balon_Greyjoy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBalonGreyjoy</string></dict>
        <key>Balon Swann</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.381.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Balon Swann is a knight of some renown.
            Ser Alton Lannister recalls that Ser Jaime Lannister defeated Ser Balon in the tourney at Willem Frey's wedding.[1]
            Four members of the Kingsguard receive Tywin Lannister at the throne room, indicating one of the spots left by the death of Ser Mandon Moore and the desertion of Sandor Clegane has been filled.[2]
            Five members of the Kingsguard escort King Tommen Baratheon to the steps before the Great Sept of Baelor so the king can meet with the High Sparrow. Members of the Faith Militant block them.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Balon is a highly regarded knight. He is the second son of Lord Gulian Swann, the head of House Swann. He is good with a lance, better with a morningstar and exceptional with a bow. He replaces Ser Preston Greenfield in the Kingsguard following his death in the Riot of King's Landing.
            In the TV series, Ser Preston is mentioned as still being alive at the time of Joffrey's wedding in Season 4. Nevertheless, a new member of the Kingsguard is present in Season 3's "The Bear and the Maiden Fair". In the books, after Sandor Clegane deserted his post during the Battle of the Blackwater his place on the Kingsguard was filled by Ser Osmund Kettleblack, but because neither Ser Osmund nor his subplot have been introduced in the TV series, it is possible that it was Balon who replaced Sandor in the TV continuity.
            SerÂ Balon also previously competed againstÂ SerÂ Jaime LannisterÂ in the books. JaimeÂ discusses Balon'sÂ renown as a tourney knight and melee fighter upon meeting him in the White Tower as a fellow Kingsguard, and the two share a common respect for each other, where BalonÂ is eventually assigned by Jaime as the primary Kingsguard for the King.
            Ser Balon is the first to testify in the trial of Tyrion Lannister. Unlike the rest of the witnesses, his testimony is wholly true, objective and in favor of Tyrion: he praises Tyrion for his bravery in the Battle of the Blackwater; he claims that he thinks Tyrion is innocent; when describing how Tyrion beat Joffrey following the Riot of King's Landing, he claims that it was only a fit of wroth. Tyrion wonders why offer a witness that believes him innocent, until Ser Meryn Trant comes to testify. Tyrion realizes then that Cersei deliberately began with a man known to be honest, and milked him for all he would give, and every witness to follow will tell a worse tale.
            Ser Balon is the only of the current Kingsguard that Jaime, as the Lord Commander, has nothing negative to comment about, and does not need to put him in his place.
            In the fourth novel, Cersei also sends a Kingsguard to take her daughter Myrcella back from Dorne to King's Landing, but it is Balon Swann, not Jaime Lannister, who in turn is sent away to pacify the Riverlands. Contrary to Jaime's furtive mission in the TV series, Ser Balon goes to Dorne in an official capacity. He has two more tasks to carry out: to deliver Gregor Clegane's skullÂ to the Martells, and to play hisÂ part in a secret plan, whose details are revealed in the following novel -Â Cersei's scheme to assassinate Trystane Martell. Unknown to Cersei, theÂ Martells have friends at the court who inform Doran about her vile plan.
            Ser Balon's retinue consists of three knights, eight squires, twenty men-at-arms, sundry grooms and servants. Bronn is not among them. They arrive atÂ Dorne without any hostile encounters.
            While Ser Balon is on his way to Sunspear, Doran's daughter Arianne attemptsÂ to execute Tyene's plan to crown Myrcella, in order to provoke theÂ Lannisters and Tyrells to attack Dorne. On the way to Hellholt, Arianne andÂ her companions are intercepted by Areo Hotah. During the confusion moments,Â one of Arianne's companions - Ser Gerold "Darkstar" Dayne - slashes at Myrcella and escapes. She survives but is disfigured permanently.
            Doran fears that once Ser Balon looks at Myrcella and reports theÂ Lannisters, they will blame the Martells and declare a war against them,Â while Dorne is no ready yet for an open confrontation. To buy time, theÂ Martells' bannermen delay Ser Balon for weeks by holding feasts, jousts andÂ hunting trips for him.
            When Ser Balon finally arrives at Sunspear, he is welcomed amicably byÂ Doran: a feast is held for him, and is given a place of high honor next toÂ Arianne. Arianne flirts with Ser Balon, while Doran converses with himÂ without showing any sign that he is aware of the plot to murder his son.Â Some of the attending people, most notably the Sand Snakes and Daemon Sand,Â show signs of disapproval (perhaps thinking that theÂ Lannisters' envoy should have been given a completely different sort of "welcome"). Areo Hotah keeps an eyeÂ on them, ready to react if they stir up troubles.
            Areo Hotah watches Ser Balon intently during the feast. He estimates thatÂ Ser Balon is more capable warrior than Arys Oakheart, and less likely to beÂ seduced by Arianne. Hotah also notices that Ser Balon is strangely nervous: he barelyÂ eats anything, sweats profusely despite the coolness in the hall, and is unnerved byÂ Doran's suggestion that he and Trystane will travel to King's Landing byÂ ship. The reason for his restlessness is soon revealed.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Balon_Swann</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBalonSwann</string></dict>
        <key>Barth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.382.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Septon Barth was Hand of the King to Jaehaerys I Targaryen.
            Jaehaerys succeeded his half-uncle Maegor Targaryen as king, a cruel tyrant who had been at war with the Faith for years. Jaehaerys was wise and diplomatic, and desired harmony between the Crown and the Faith for the good of the realm, so he negotiated a peaceful end to the Faith Militant uprising. Together with his new Hand of the King, Septon Barth, Jaehaerys reached an accord with the High Septon: the crown would grant an amnesty and swear to always defend the Faith, and in return, the Faith Militant would disband and the Faith would withhold condemnations of the incestuous practices of the Targaryens.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Barth is remembered as one of the best Hands of the King that the realm ever had, just as Jaehaerys I is remembered as possibly its best king. Together they did much to improve and strengthen the realm across four decades of peace and prosperity.
            Barth was actually low-born, the son of a blacksmith. He eventually became a septon and served in a humble position overseeing the Red Keep's library, where he became one of the most learned men in Westeros. King Jaehaerys I raised in up to be his Hand of the King; Jaehaerys greatly loved his sister-wife Queen Alysanne, who was practically his co-ruler, but it is said that Barth was his greatest friend, who was also very skilled in his office, aiding Jaehaerys in all the great works of his reign. While Barth was very well-educated, he remained plain-spoken and approachable.
            Barth greatly valued all knowledge, and even took an interest in rare manuscripts from across the Narrow Sea which had survived the Doom of Valyria. From his translated readings he wrote several famous compendiums of his own, on topics such as Magic and Dragons, leading some later writers to criticize that he was half a sorcerer (though of course, given that during Jaehaerys's reign living dragons were kept at the royal court, it wasn't that far-fetch for Barth to study them).
            Barth's writings include several claims which later maesters dismiss as mere fantasy (i.e. believing that the White Walkers actually existed once), particularly in his book Dragons, Wyrms, and Wyverns: Their Unnatural History - considered one of the best recent works on dragon-lore. About sixty years after Jaehaerys's death, however, the pious King Baelor I Targaryen ordered all of Barth's books hunted down and burned for containing wicked and unnatural knowledge.
            A few precious fragments of Barth's writings, however, survived Baelor's destruction order, and they are of great value to those interested in topics such as dragons. Tyrion Lannister managed to gets his hands on a fragment about ten years before the main narrative. Maester Aemon was also well-versed in readings from the surviving fragments, knowledge he shared with Samwell Tarly. Aemon said that according to Barth, dragons can actually shift gender from female to male and back again, as the needs of the species require - other maesters are aware of this claim but dismiss it as fantastical.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Barth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBarth</string></dict>
        <key>Asher Forrester</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.383.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Asher Forrester is the second-born son of Lord Gregor Forrester and Lady Elissa Forrester. He has been exiled across the Narrow Sea and has currently returned to Westeros.
            Asher had always been a rebellious youth â brawling in taverns, sleeping with whores, and finding ways to raise his fatherâs ire. But his life took a dark turn when, at age seventeen, he fell in love with Gwyn Whitehill, the daughter of Ludd Whithill, his fatherâs bitter rival and began a secret love affair with her. Bloodshed ensued and Lord Forrester faced a grim choice: go to war, or exile Asher across the Narrow Sea. He chose the latter. Asher remains in Essos to this day, living as a sellsword, trying not to think about the life he left.[1]
            When Asher heard his brother Ethan was tormented by a miller's boy, Asher grabbed him by the neck and beat half of the boy's teeth out without hesitation. While his father was angry, he only cared about Ethan's safety.[2]
            At some point he met Beskha and the two of them became partners. Asher and Beskha traveled to Volantis during their adventures, were they soon became enemies with Tazal, a member of the Lost Legion.[3]
            During their time journeying, they made it to Lys, where he and Beskha fought the Scourge, a brawler who fought with double axes, and killed him.[4]
            As House Forrester deteriorates with the death of its Lord and first heir at the Red Wedding, Elissa Forrester considers pardoning Asher due to his strong and decisive nature, and House Forrester needs more swords now more than ever. She wishes to sent her brother Malcolm Branfield to retrieve him. Elissa asks her Houses' new lord Ethan, her son, to consider allowing Malcolm to get Asher. In King's Landing Mira has a coin from Yunkai sent to her from Asher.[5]
            Malcolm explains he is in Yunkai following the deaths of Asher's father and brother (Malcolm does not know that Rodrik actually survived the Red Wedding) to take him back to Ironrath, also hoping to hire an army of mercenaries to fight for House Forrester against the Whitehills and - potentially - the Boltons. Asher and Beskha decide to call in a favor with an old acquaintance to secure a sellsword army in Meereen. Although Beskha admits to having unfinished business in Meereen she doesn't explain what it is and assures Asher it won't be a problem. Malcolm, Asher and Beskha dodge the Lost Legion again as they leave Yunkai.[6]
            Asher, Beskha, and Malcolm continue their journey to Meereen and find themselves at the dead end of a canyon somewhere beyond Yunkai. Asher has the choice to defend both of them against each other until the Lost Legion appears and chases them into a cave. Tazal will also be mentioned. Beskha or Malcolm will judgeÂ Asher on whether or notÂ he killed him. Asher will encounter Drogon and will have the option to defend Beskha (from Drogon) or Malcolm (from the Lost Legion) one of them will judgeÂ him for this and have injuries later on.
            After escaping the cave, Asher and the others then arrive at Daenerys Targaryen's camp just outside Meereen where they encounter Croft in his tent who punches Asher and angrily threatens him for stealing from him but soon reveals it was all a joke after he threatens to cut off one of Asher's body parts (an eyes, hand or his balls). Asher then admits that he needs an army and has the option to give Croft gold he found near the cave (assuming the player picks it up) he will happily take the gold but will not change his mind until Asher reveals he encountered Drogon. Croft will then set up a meeting with Asher and Daenerys, who only appears briefly at the end but tells Asher that if he has news of Drogon he should "choose his words carefully".[7]
            Asher, after entering Daenerys' tent, requests that he be given the Second Sons, however Daenerys is furious that Beskha, Malcolm and himself tried to harm Drogon but will eventually offer them a mission. Asher and Beskha must take Croft and go into Meereen to help liberate the city and uninstall the slave masters from its governing. Daenerys assures Asher that if he does his job right he will be rewarded but they must follow Croft's orders exactly or they will get nothing. She also orders Malcolm to remain behind, which he does. Asher agrees, however Beskha remains hostile about Meereen.
            While wandering the camp, Asher catches Croft and Beskha arguing over orders and Beskha, very drunk gets violent. After Croft storms out, Beskha gets angry at Asher repeatedly striking him although Asher has the option to fight back. After Beskha has calmed down she reveals she was a slave, which is why she has such sour feeling towards Meereen.
            After some careful planning, Asher, Beskha, and Croft enter the city to liberate it, however after Beskha sees a slave beaten to death, she raids the home of her former master, Dezhor zo Raza. She kicks him to the streets where he begs for mercy but Croft tells her to spare him until the city is liberated. Asher has the option to kill Dezhor zo Raza himself, stop Beskha, or let her kill him, what ever option Asher chooses he will be judged for it later. While clearing out a large Meereenise encampments, Asher and Beskha try to stop some guards from lighting a beacon which will signal more guards. Asher climbs a Harpy statue and destroys the beacon along with the guard trying to light it. Asher, Beskha, and Croft then stand over the encampment and listen to the Liberation begin.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Asher_Forrester</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAsherForrester</string></dict>
        <key>Barristan Selmy</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.384.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Barristan Selmy was a knight who served in the Kingsguard with distinction for almost forty years. Nicknamed Barristan the Bold, he was considered by many to be one of the best swordsmen and most honorable men in the whole of the Seven Kingdoms.
            He served as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during the reigns of King Aerys II Targaryen, King Robert I Baratheon, and, for a short time, King Joffrey I Baratheon. After his public dismissal by Joffrey (an affront, as the Kingsguard is an irrevocable lifetime appointment), Ser Barristan, free of any vows, chooses to serve Daenerys Targaryen.
            Barristan Selmy was the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, the elite bodyguard of the King of the Andals and the First Men. Barristan is the only known member of House Selmy, a minor house that serves House Baratheon. Barristan Selmy is noted as an extremely capable warrior, even in his old age, and has a reputation for honor and chivalry that is second to none. He served in the Kingsguard of Aerys II Targaryen.Â He fought in the battle against the Kingswood Brotherhood and slew their leader Simon Toyne.[1] Jaime Lannister, then aged 16, squired for Selmy during the battle and greatly admired his skill.[2]
            He also attended the The Great Tourney at Harrenhal, in which he danced with Ashara Dayne.
            Although dismayed by King Aerys's many acts of insane cruelty, Ser Barristan had great admiration and loyalty for Aerys's son and heir Rhaegar Targaryen. He never wavered in his loyalty to House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion, in accordance with the vows he swore when he joined the Kingsguard; he fought alongside Rhaegar's army at the Battle of the Trident, where Rhaegar was killed and Selmy was wounded. Both Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark held Ser Barristan in very high esteem.
            Upon assuming the throne, in spite of Roose Bolton's advice to execute Selmy, Robert pardoned him and made him Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.[3]
            King Robert Baratheon, Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Jaime Lannister swap war stories in the Red Keep. Barristan recalls his first kill as being a Tyroshi soldier whose name he never knew. Barristan killed him with a lance to the heart. Barristan and Jaime also discuss their campaign against the Kingswood Brotherhood, when Barristan slew Simon Toyne in single combat while Jaime scored his own first kill - an outlaw he decapitated - as a squire of sixteen.[1] Selmy attends the King at the tournament thrown in honor of Lord Eddard Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.[4]
            Barristan stands vigil for Ser Hugh of the Vale after his death in a tournament accident. Eddard quizzes him over Hugh's death and how the lots are drawn to determine which knight will face another in the contests. Eddard states that, in his father's opinion, Barristan was the finest knight in the Seven Kingdoms.
            Barristan acknowledges that the Mad King's murder of Eddard's father was a grave crime and he is glad they did not cross swords at the Battle of the Trident.[5]
            Barristan later accompanies Robert, his squire Lancel Lannister and Lord Renly Baratheon on a hunt in the Kingswood. The king reflects on how much better things used to be, but Renly angrily accuses him of nostalgic self-delusion before stomping off. Barristan is bemused by the exchange, as well as Lancel's constant refilling of Robert's wineskin.[6] Robert tracks a boar and attempts to kill it singlehanded. He takes a grievous wound but finishes the boar off with his dirk. Barristan bitterly claims to have failed the king as Robert lies on his deathbed, but Eddard counsels him that no one could protect Robert from himself.[7]
            Barristan accompanies the wounded king's return trip to King's Landing and stands guard outside his chambers. After Robert's death, he stands guard in the throne room as King Joffrey Baratheon commands his counsellors to swear fealty to him.
            Barristan is shocked when Queen Cersei destroys Robert's proclamation announcing that Eddard is to become the Protector of the Realm, but even more so when Eddard says that Joffrey has no claim to the Iron Throne. During the ensuing melee, Eddard orders that Barristan is not to be harmed, but the City Watch betrays and murders Eddard's men and takes Eddard prisoner instead.[7]
            Joffrey later shocks the court by publicly dismissing Barristan from the Kingsguard - which is an irrevocable lifetime appointment - on the grounds of old age and the fact he failed to protect Robert. However, the reality is that Cersei is cleaning house by removing anyone from court who isn't a dedicated Lannister-loyalist. Barristan's shock turns to outrage when Cersei announces that his position as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard is toÂ be given toÂ Jaime Lannister. Barristan openly denounces Jaime as "the man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!", causing CerseiÂ to angrily rebuke him. Varys tries to defuse the situation byÂ offering Selmy a keep to live in and servants to tend his needs out of respect for his years of service, but Ser Barristan bluntly refuses the offer, insulted atÂ the council's attempt to fob him off with "a hall to die in and men to bury me". He tears off his cloak, breastplate, and some other items saying he is a knight and will die a knight. Littlefinger crassly jokes that he will apparently be a "naked knight", prompting the whole court to laugh at him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Barristan_Selmy</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBarristanSelmy</string></dict>
        <key>Arthur Glenmore</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.385.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Arthur Glenmore was the younger brother of Elaena Glenmore, and commander of House Glenmore's Elite Guard.
            As a youth, on the day he learned to hold a bow, his father noticed how nervous he was and labeled him Quiver.
            Arthur appears in this episode alongside his sister, Elaena. They meet with Rodrik Forrester discussing Elaena's marriage to Gryff. Arthur offers to give Rodrik the twenty man strong Elite Guard of House Glenmore if you decide to take down Gryff Whitehill. He will later march with his men into Ironrath alongside Rodrik and awaits Rodrik's signal to come help him. Then, after Rodrik casts the signal Arthur and his elite guard storm the Great Hall and capture all the Whitehill soldiers and possibly killed one if the decision was made. He later witnessed Rodrik beat or maimed Gryff's eye and then takes Gryff and the Whitehill soldiers and imprisons them in the cellar.
            Later in the episode Royland and Duncan discuss about a meeting at Highpoint. Here you can either decide to leave Arthur and his men to protect Ironrath or have them be your bodyguards at the meeting.
            If you decide to leave Arthur and his guards at Ironrath when you return from the meeting they're no where to be found along with everyone else and Rodrik will find that arrows were fired indicating a battle, leaving Arthur's fate uncertain as you find that Ramsay Snow has taken Ironrath.
            If you do decide to take Arthur and his guard to Highpoint, Gwyn Whitehill will note that her father, Ludd Whitehill will view this as a show of force. Regardless Rodrik will eventually return from the meeting to Ironrath with Arthur and his guard, Lady Forrester, and the chosen adviser only to discover that is empty and Arthur wondering where his sister is, then everyone hears Ramsay Snow laughing from the Great Hall.
            This part happens regardless, even if you brought the Glenmore soldiers with you in Sons of Winter.
            An unknown cry for help is heard by Rodrik and Talia upon reaching the Grove, it is shown that Arthur is being flayed by Ramsay.
            On the brink of passing out, he pleads to Ramsay to stop but Ramsay in response tells him that a lesson needs to be learnt and somebody has to pay, he passes out shortly afterwards.
            Arthur is then disemboweled by Ramsay in front of Rodrik and Talia Forrester, killing him almost instantly.
            An easter egg can be found if Rodrik brings Arthur to Highpoint. If Rodrik speaks to him multiple times, Arthur will ask why Rodrik keeps looking at him. If he does so once again, Arthur asks Rodrik if he 'sees something he likes' and raises his eyebrows twice suggestively, prompting a confused and nervous response from Rodrik.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Glenmore</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascArthurGlenmore</string></dict>
        <key>Alliser Thorne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.386.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Alliser ThorneÂ was the Master-at-Arms at Castle Black and is responsible for training new recruits to the Night's Watch.
            After the Battle of Castle Black, Thorne loses the election to become the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, narrowly beaten by Jon Snow. The new Lord Commander names him the First Ranger, as a result of his experience and to appease his followers in the Watch. Thorne, however, betrays and leads a against Jon after the latter led a mission to Hardhome to rescue the remaining wildlings, but after Jon is resurrected, Thorne is arrested and later hanged for his treason.
            Ser Alliser Thorne is a member of the Night's Watch. He is from House Thorne, a noble house of the Crownlands sworn to the Iron Throne. He fought on House Targaryen's side during Robert's Rebellion, which ended in their defeat.Â Like many other Targaryen loyalists, the victorious rebels subsequently gave him a choice between execution or joining the Night's Watch. He chose the latter.
            During the last winter,Â Thorne and his ranger companions were trapped in a massive winter storm and had to resort to cannibalism to survive.[1] Through seventeen years of able service, Thorne rose through the ranks of the officers in the Night's Watch to become the master-of-arms at Castle Black, responsible for training new recruits - a task he takes no joy in, as most recruits in recent generations tend to be petty criminals sent to the Wall as punishment.
            Thorne sets Jon Snow against his fellow recruits Rast, Pypar and Grenn, and mockingly refers to Jon as "Lord Snow". Jon beats the other recruits easily, due to his previous training at Winterfell, but is unaware that Thorne, who despises Eddard Stark for the part he played in Robert's Rebellion, is making him unpopular by emphasizing his superiority. Tyrion Lannister advises Jon to take into account the less privileged upbringing of the other recruits and suggests that Jon could befriend them by sharing his skills.[2]
            Later, Thorne is disgusted by the obesity and softness of new recruit Samwell Tarly, nicknaming him "Lord Piggy". He has Rast beat Sam when he will not fight back. Jon convinces the others to refuse to hurt Sam, but when they do, Thorne sees through the ruse and berates Jon. Thorne later confronts Jon and Sam, revealing that he once had to cannibalize the frozen remains of his comrades to avoid starvation during a ranging beyond the Wall in a particularly cold winter. He berates Jon and Sam for their softness, and warns Jon that his "protection" of Sam from the harsh training that he needs will eventually get him killed.[1]
            Thorne is pleased when Jon is made a steward, since Jon had hoped to become a ranger like his uncle Benjen Stark. Lord Commander Jeor Mormont takes Jon as his personal steward. Jon believes that Thorne played a hand in him becoming a steward as revenge for defying him, but Sam convinces Jon that this means that Jon will be privy to the inner workings of the Night's Watch command structure, and that the Lord Commander may actually want to groom Jon for a high position within the Watch.[3]
            After Eddard is (falsely) arrested as a traitor, Thorne taunts Jon and calls him "not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard". Jon draws a knife and attempts to strike Thorne but is restrained and punished by being restricted to his quarters.[4] Later, the Lord Commander sends Thorne to King's Landing with the frozen hand of one of the wights to warn King Joffrey Baratheon and the royal court of the return of the White Walkers. He notes that part of his decision was to keep Jon and Thorne separated for a time.[5]
            Upon his return to the Wall, Thorne has been declared the Acting Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He is one of the five black brothers to "judge"Â JonÂ for his actions during his time with theÂ wildlings. Jon hides nothing of his actions, neither his murder ofÂ Qhorin nor his affair withÂ Ygritte. Thorne disbelieves Jon's claim that the Halfhand wanted to die, but Jon counters that ifÂ Thorne was as close to Qhorin as he claims, he would know the fallen brother would have done anything to protect the Wall. Maester Aemon defends Jon on the other charge, pointing out that he isn't the first to have broken his vow of celibacy. Thorne points out that Jon hasn't simply visited the whorehouse in Mole's Town: he has quite literally slept with the enemy. Jon counters with all the information that he had learned while among the wildlings, such asÂ Mance Rayder's strategy of attacking the Wall from the North and the South, and demands that they either kill him or let him go. AemonÂ tells him that they have no intention of executing him and Jon leaves. ThorneÂ reprimands Aemon for having overruled him but Aemon wryly replies that he can tell who is lying to him, since he grew up inÂ King's Landing.[6]
            ThorneÂ is present whenÂ a young boy, Olly, tells the Night's Watch how a wildling raiding party massacred his village. Most black brothers want to seek revenge and send the wildlings a message, but Jon and Thorne know better: that is exactly what the wildlings want, to draw them out of Castle Black and fight them in the open. The black brothers are interrupted by two rangers returning, Grenn and Eddison Tollett, who have escaped the mutineers holed up at Craster's Keep. Upon learning that the mutineers are still at Craster's Keep, Jon claims that they must be captured or killed. Thorne initially refuses, but Jon claims that it is to stop the mutineers from revealing the truth of the Night's Watch's defenses to Mance Rayder's army if they are attacked, since Jon has previously exaggerated to Mance. Thorne has also given Sam a new derogatory nickname: "Sam the Slayer", disbelieving his claim that he killed a White Walker with a dragonglass dagger.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Alliser_Thorne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAlliserThorne</string></dict>
        <key>Axell Florent</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.387.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>AxellÂ Florent was the Lord of Brightwater Keep, the head of House Florent and brother of Queen Selyse, the wife of King Stannis I.
            Ser Axell Florent is a member of House Florent of Brightwater Keep, a noble house sworn to House Tyrell of the Reach. House Florent follows their liege lords, House Tyrell, in pledging support to Renly Baratheon's claim to the Iron Throne at the onset of the War of the Five Kings. Following the death of Renly, however, the Florents do not follow their Tyrell overlords and instead go over to Stannis, as Selyse Florent is the wife of Stannis.[1]
            Ser Axell is burned alive by Melisandre on the beach of Dragonstone for refusing to renounce the Seven. He pleads to his sister and brother-in-law for mercy, which they do not give.
            Davos SeaworthÂ disapproves of Axell'sÂ death, saying Axell was Stannis'sÂ brother by law and thatÂ he chose to follow the gods of his fathers, which were the gods of Stannis's fathers too. Stannis replies that he ordered Axell to destroy his idols, but he disobeyed.Â When Davos asked how many ships and men AxellÂ brought to Stannis's cause Stannis replies "A good deal more than you".
            When speaking toÂ Melisandre,Â ShireenÂ says that AxellÂ was always kind to her.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Axell Florent has been the castellan of Dragonstone for a decade and the "Queen's Hand", a self-styled title that he uses often. He is not Selyse's brother, but her uncle. He is also a devoted follower of R'hllor. He is described as short and muscular, with a barrel chest, thick arms, bandy legs, and hair growing from his ears. So far in the books, he is alive and well.
            Axell is one ofÂ the "Queen's men" - members of Stannis's court who have converted to the faith of R'hllor (in contrast to the "King's men" who are also supporters of Stannis's cause, but have kept the Faith of the Seven).
            Axell has always treated Davos courteously, but this changes when Davos returns to Dragonstone intending to kill Melisandre. Axell arrests Davos shortly after he arrives, and ever since he treats Davos hostilely. He tells Davos bluntly that if it was up to him - Davos would have been executed alongside Alester.
            Axell advises Stannis to raid Claw Isle as a punishment for Lord Celtigar's betrayal. He warns Davos that he must support the plan - otherwise, some "accident" will happen to him. Davos does not take the warning lightly, but objects firmly to the plan, and manages to dissuade Stannis. Axell does not follow through with his threat (perhaps because Stannis promotes Davos to be his Hand), but resents Davos thereafter. He enjoys making fun of Davos in presence of other lords, by stressing the point that Davos is lowborn and therefore not fit to be King's Hand.
            Axell claims that, as a believer of R'hllor, he can see visions of the future in flames. Davos asks Melisandre how could Axell earn that gift so quickly, and she smiles and answers enigmatically "Any cat may stare into a fire and see red mice at play".
            Axell, alongside Melisandre and Selyse, urges Stannis to sacrifice his bastard nephew Edric Storm (in the show replaced with Gendry), while Davos objects.
            In "A Dance with Dragons", Axell accompanies Selyse and Shireen when they come to Castle Black. Jon grows to dislike him after a short conversation, especially because of Axell's ribald comments about Val, and tells him bluntly "Ser Axell, if you are truly theÂ QueenâsÂ Hand, I pity Her Grace". Hearing that Axell has done nothing to prevent Alester's death, Jon muses disdainfully "If he is not a kinslayer, he is the next best thing... what sort of man can stand by idly and watch his own brother being burned alive?".
            Axell intends to marry the elder daughter of the wildling raider Gerrick Kingsblood, who declared himself as King of the wildlings.
            The character in the the TV series has little in common with his book counterpart, but is instead an amalgamation of two other book characters: Lord Alester Florent and Lord Guncer Sunglass.
            Alester Florent is the Lord of Brightwater Keep and the head of House Florent. He is the brother of Axell, the uncle of Selyse, the father of Melessa Tarly and the grandfather of Samwell Tarly. He was initially sworn to Renly Baratheon, but after Renly's death he was the first to declare for Stannis. He was also among the first of the new lords to discard the Faith of the Seven and take up the worship of R'hllor. He briefly served as Stannis' Hand of the King before Davos. He is old, thin and tall, with silver hair and a beard shaped in a spike surrounding a long and distinguished face.
            Alester receives the distress message that the Night's Watch sent to Dragonstone, but does not show it to Stannis, reasoning that "his Grace lacks the men to fight his own battles, he has none to waste on Wildlings". Davos thinks Alester was right; besides, the talk of "five kings" would certainly have angered Stannis. This is the same letter that Davos shows Stannis after saving Edric Storm, persuading him to travel north and help the Night's Watch.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Axell_Florent</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAxellFlorent</string></dict>
        <key>Aggo </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.388.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aggo is a Dothraki warrior serving in the khalasar of Khal Moro.
            Aggo and Qhono comment on Daenerys Targaryen as they are bringing her to Khal Moro.[1]
            Once in Vaes Dothrak, Aggo and his companion Iggo happen across Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis as they attempt to infiltrate in the holy city. Aggo sees through Jorah's claim to being a wine merchant and orders his companion to raise the alarm. Jorah attacks Aggo but as both are unarmed, the younger and larger Dothraki begins to overpower the older Westerosi knight, beating him severely. Jorah attempts to blind Aggo with a thrown handful of sand but misses. Aggo seizes Jorah by the throat and begins to choke the life from him but is fatally stabbed in the back by Daario. To hide Aggo's stab wound, as weapons are forbidden in the holy city, Daario repeatedly bludgeons Aggo's corpse with a large rock.
            Later, the great Khals discuss Aggo's death. Khal Moro notes that Aggo, a rider in his khalasar, served him well, yet nonchalantly dismisses his death for the way in which he was killed.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the only Dothraki named Aggo is Daenerys's bloodrider. However, Daenerys's storyline has surpassed the latest published novel, A Dance with Dragons, to Aggo or an equivalent character may appear in the upcoming novels.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Akho</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAggo</string></dict>
        <key>Azor Ahai</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.389.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Azor Ahai was a legendary hero who lived approximately eight thousand years before Aegon's Landing. It is said that during the The Long Night, Azor Ahai rose up and defeated the Others, wielding a sword of fire called Lightbringer.
            Darkness lay over the world and Azor Ahai was the hero chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.
            The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.
            The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer.
            According to prophecy, in ancient books of Asshai from over five thousand years ago, Azor Ahai is to be reborn again to challenge the Others. This will occur after a long summer when an evil, cold darkness descends upon the world. It is said that wielding Lightbringer once again, Azor Ahai will stand against the Others, and if he fails, the world fails with him.
            "There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him."
            Some readers believe that Azor Ahai reborn is the same hero as The Prince That Was Promised, while others believe that is erroneous and that they come from two distinct prophecies. Azor Ahai and The Prince That Was Promised have thus far never been mentioned in the same sentence, although Melisandre has mentioned the prince that was promised and Azor Ahai interchangeably; however, she tends to use the name Azor Ahai far more often.
            The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014) clarifies that there are several mythological or legendary characters similar to Azor Ahai, and that both the maesters and the scholars of Yi Ti believe them to all be the same figure (much as all there stories of the Long Night itself are understood to refer to the same event). Other Azor Ahai figures referred to east of the Bone Mountains are Hyrkoon the Hero, Yin Tar, Neferion, and Eldric Shadowchaser.
            In the third and fifth novels, Melisandre states "When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone. The bleeding star has come and gone, and Dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt. Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai reborn!". While Dragonstone (a volcanic island) can indeed be considered as place of "smoke and salt", Stannis was not born there but in Storm's End, and so far has not woken any dragons from stone; Daenerys, on the other hand, was born on Dragonstone, and has hatched fossilized dragon eggs into live dragons, in a miraculous ritual under the red comet at the pyre of her late husband Drogo. Apparently Melisandre is unaware that Daenerys is more likely to be Azor Ahai than Stannis, based on her own words.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Azor_Ahai</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAzorAhai</string></dict>

            Adrack Humble was part of the ironborn raiding party sent by King Balon Greyjoy to seize Moat Cailin during the War of the Five Kings. He is illiterate.
            When Ralf Kenning refuses the terms of surrender that Theon Greyjoy has offered on behalf of Roose Bolton, Humble kills him with an axe to the head, preferring to surrender and live than to die. Being unable to read, he asks Theon to clarify that if they surrender they will be allowed to leave. Theon confirms this, and the ironborn open the gates to House Bolton. However, Ramsay Snow and his men flay them alive anyway.Â Ramsay is then legitimized as a true member of House Bolton for taking Moat Cailin.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Adrack Humble is an ironborn raider and a member of House Humble, a lesser house descended from thralls and salt wives. He lost one of his arms in battle, but is still a fierce fighter. He has one rock wife and three salt wives, three of whom were pregnant when he left the Iron Islands.
            Adrack is among the ironborn that Victarion Greyjoy leaves to guard Moat Cailin under the command of Ralf Kenning. The garrison lives under constant attack from the crannogmen, who attack them with poisoned darts, resulting in the death of several men and the sickness of many others.
            Ramsay Bolton sends Theon Greyjoy to give peace terms to the Ironborn at Moat Cailin, promising them food and safe passage. The surviving ironborn are unsure whether to accept the terms or not. Dagon Codd firmly objects, reminding the others that Theon is the one called "The Turncloak" and they should not believe him. Then Adrack Humble kills Dagon by throwing an axe at his forehead. He tells the others threateningly that they must leave. The other ironborn comply. On the way to Ramsay's camp, Adrack tells Theon about his wives, promising that when he returns to the Iron Islands, he may name a son after Theon in grattitude. Theon is unimpressed, knowing what Ramsay plans for the ironborn. The next day, Theon notices that, among the sixty-three flayed bodies of the ironborn displayed on pikes along the moat, one of the bodies is one-armed.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Adrack_Humble</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascAdrackHumble</string></dict>
        <key>Artys Arryn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.391.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Artys I Arryn, also known as the Falcon Knight, was a knight that participated in the Andal Invasion of Westeros and the founder of House Arryn.
            Artys Arryn was an Andal knight born at the Giant's Lance in the Vale. This meant that he knew the region as well as the First Men who inhabited it, and the Andals in the Vale united behind him as their leader. In the Battle of the Seven Stars, the Andals under Ser Artys fought against the First Men under High King Robar II Royce to determine the fate of the Vale.[1]
            The First Men preferred to use infantry and had dug trenches lined with sharpened stakes on the high ground, while the Andals had mounted knights. The first six charges against Robar's line failed, until Torgold Tollett broke through. Seeing Artys' falcon-shaped helmet, Robar charged at him in the hope that the Andal army would dissolve if their leader was killed. Using the Valyrian steel sword Lady Forlorn, Robar beheaded the Falcon Knight after a duel, only to see five hundred fresh Andal knights charging from the Giant's Lance with Artys at their head. Esteeming cunning even more than brute force, Artys had clad one of his knights in his own distinctive armor to distract Robar while he led a force of his best cavalry up a goat track he knew from childhood.[1]
            Afterwards, Artys became King of the Mountain and the Vale and founded House Arryn.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Artys is the hero of a thousand tales. Robert Arryn, the child lord of the Eyrie, is fond of Ser Artys' stories. In the The World of Ice and Fire book it is revealed that the historical Ser Artys Arryn has been conflated by singers with a previous legendary First Men figure known as the Winged Knight.
            The Winged Knight was a legendary figure of the Age of Heroes - made a knight by singers and storytellers as knighthood was an Andal tradition - said to have flown upon a huge falcon and had armies of eagles at this command. He won the theÂ ValeÂ by slaying theÂ Griffin KingÂ atop theÂ Giant's Lance. He is said to have been friendly withÂ giantsÂ andÂ merlings. His wife, one of theÂ children of the forest, died giving birth to his son. Maester Yandel speculates singers conflated the two figures to curry favor with the Arryn dynasty, giving rise to legends that Ser Artys was the Winged Knight who drove the First Men from the Vale and took the Eyrie, instead of its construction being carried out by descendants of Ser Artys ever since his grandson, Roland I Arryn, ordered it.
            Although Artys and the Winged Knight are presented as the same in the Season 1 Complete Guide to Westeros by Catelyn Stark, the Season 6 Histories and Lore presents the story of the true Artys Arryn.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Artys_Arryn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascArtysArryn</string></dict>

            Bannen is a Ranger of the Night's Watch, originally from White Harbor, the only city in the North. He takes part in the Great Ranging led by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and survives the Battle of the Fist of the First Men, though he's injured.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Bannen is one the of survivors of the battle at the Fist of the First Men who make it to Craster's Keep. He and eleven others are critically wounded. Sam and Giant try to treat him and the other injured men, but the medicine bags have been lost during the battle, thus all they can do is keep the wounded dry and warm and feed them. The ranger Kedge Whiteye has taken Bannen's mangled foot, but it is too little and too late. Bannen keeps saying "I'm cold. I'm so cold". Sam tries to feed him onion broth, but he cannot swallow. Craster nastily comments "That one's dead. Be kinder to stick a knife in his chest than that spoon down his throat, you ask me".
            After lying in agony at least nine days, Bannen dies of his injuries, much as he did in the TV series.

        <key>Arthur Dayne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.394.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Arthur Dayne was a knight of House Dayne who bore the title of "Sword of the Morning" as he possessed the ancestral sword of House Dayne, Dawn. He was also a member of the Kingsguard under King Aerys II Targaryen.
            Ser Arthur was the second son of Beric Dayne, Lord of Starfall. As the wielder of the sword Dawn, which had been forged from the metal of a fallen star, he bore the title of "the Sword of the Morning". He was sent to deal with the Kingswood Brotherhood and subsequently killed the Smiling Knight in a duel.
            While skimming The Book of Brothers, King Joffrey Baratheon reads through the entry on Ser Arthur Dayne, mentioning his leading of the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood and his defeat of the Smiling Knight, one of its members, in single combat. The Book of Brothers also mentions that at one point he was granted temporary command over the Kingsguard after Lord Commander Gerold Hightower suffered injuries. The entry concludes by recounting how he perished at the end of Robert's Rebellion alongside Ser Gerold at the Red Mountains of Dorne, fighting Lord Eddard Stark.[1]
            Ser Arthur Dayne is seen with Ser Gerold Hightower, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard under King Aerys II Targaryen, in a vision when Bran Stark sees into the past with the aid of the Three-Eyed Raven. Near the end of Robert's Rebellion, Ser Arthur and Ser Gerold were stationed to guard the Tower of Joy by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen himself. When Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell arrives with his bannermen, including Lord Howland Reed, in order to rescue the captive Lyanna Stark, Ser Arthur and Ser Gerold Hightower prevent the Northmen from entering the tower, peacefully. Ser Arthur is shown to be cordial to Eddard, but refuses to tell him why exactly the now-deceased Rhaegar wanted them to remain there or the whereabouts of Eddard's sister. Knowing there is no alternative, Ser Arthur and Ser Gerold fight the Northmen to hold the tower. Gerold is quickly killed by Lord Eddard in the melee, but Ser Arthur easily holds his own against the Northmen, cutting down most of them with his two swords, leaving just him and Eddard. As Bran watches them duel, he observes that Dayne is a better swordsman than his father. The Three-Eyed Raven corrects him: "far better". Dayne eventually disarms Eddard but as he moves to strike him down, Howland Reed, who had been wounded earlier in the battle, sneaks up behind Dayne and stabs him in the back of the neck.
            Ser Arthur is mortally wounded by the attack and falls to his knees, holding on to his sword for a few seconds before dropping it as his strength fades. The two look at each other as Eddard picks up Dawn, seeming ashamed of how he had survived. Although in agony, Arthur seems accepting of his fate; he had done his duty to the last.[2] Eddard delivers the final blow, killing the legendary Sword of the Morning and sparing him from a slower, crueler death.[3]
            After killing Dayne, Eddard runs up into the tower where he finds Lyanna, dying after giving birth to Rhaegar's last living son, whom Eddard would pass off as his bastard son, Jon Snow.[4]
            Ser Arthur's reputation was such that, when people remembered him, it was in acclaim. Years later, Eddard Stark would comment that Ser Arthur Dayne was the best warrior Ned had ever encountered. Even when they outnumbered him, Ned and his companions were extremely wary about how to approach him, showing that Arthur's skill and reputation frightened them. In addition, Arthur was extremely loyal, to a fault, to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, stating very matter-of-factly that the only reason he and Ser Gerold did not fight on the Trident was because Rhaegar ordered them to remain at the tower. Even after the deaths of Rhaegar and Aerys, he continued to follow Rhaegar's orders to protect the pregnant Lyanna Stark, even if that meant killing her brother Eddard. Although this probably had to do mostly with his vows, it could have also had something to do with the fact that Rhaegar's great-grandmother, Queen Dyanna, was born a Dayne, which could have in turn made Rhaegar and his children, including Jon, kin of some sort to Ser Arthur. Not much else is known about Ser Arthur, but he is shown to be extremely gentlemanly and polite in Bran's vision, greeting his father by title and even wishing him "good fortune in the wars to come"; a hint that despite his skills as a swordsman, even he sometimes, if not always, considered the possibility of losing before fighting someone else to the death. This also suggests that Arthur did not fear death as evidenced by the fact that he didn't beg for his life when Howland Reed wounded him. Instead, he simply faced Ned down before the latter finished him off.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels,Â Ser Arthur Dayne was a knight who had achieved legendary status by the time the events of the books take place. Dayne wielded the greatsword Dawn, a blade said to have been forged from metal from the heart of a fallen star, and bore the title of "the Sword of the Morning" (he is never stated to have wielded two swords, as portrayed in the TV series). He was a close friend of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Dayne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascArthurDayne</string></dict>
        <key>Manticores</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.395.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Manticores are highly aggressive and extremely venomous scorpion-like insects from the continent of Essos.
            Manticores originate from several tropical islands in the Jade Sea, in the distant east beyond Qarth.
            Manticore venom is one of the deadliest known poisons, however, and as a result manticores have been imported into the collections of assassins and alchemists across the world.  The city of Mantarys, east of the Free Cities and west of Slaver's Bay, is particularly noted as a producer of extracted manticore venom.[1]
            Manticores are physically similar to scorpions, but can grow almost as large as a lobster. They possess six legs and larger stinger-tail, which curves up over the body, hanging over the head. They have a series of threatening-looking spines on each body segment, running up the sides of the body and tail. They are mostly green in color, with an irridescent sheen.[2]
            Their most recognizable features are the designs on the plates of their bodies, particularly the marking on the final plate of their tails which resembles a human face. Because of this design they are also sometimes referred to as the "Death's Head Manticore".[3]
            Manticore venom is extremely lethal, and even a single sting is usually more than enough to kill a person. Extracted manticore venom is one of the most potent poisons used by the world's assassins: one usage is to coat bladed weapons with it so that even a single scratch will kill.[4]
            An agent of the Warlocks of Qarth attempts to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen using a manticore hidden inside a hollow wooden sphere.Â Before the creature can harmÂ DaenerysÂ with its lethal sting,Â SerÂ Barristan SelmyÂ impales it with a dagger, killing it.[5]
            Grand Maester Pycelle and Qyburn assess that Oberyn Martell coated his spear with manticore venom prior to his duel with Ser Gregor Clegane. While Gregor won the duel by crushing Oberyn's head in, the poisoned wounds he took left him in agony, and he is now comatose. The effects of the poison are horrific, making the flesh around Gregor's wounds putrefy, which produces an overpowering stench. Pycelle regretfully tells Queen Cersei Lannister that Ser Gregor is beyond any hope of healing, but Qyburn insists that he can use the knowledge he has gained from unethical human experimentation to save Gregor's life. Cersei gives him permission to proceed, though he warns that the process will "change" Gregor.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, manticores are venomous insects from Essos, said to live on the jungle-filled islands of the Jade Sea, between Qarth and distant Asshai. They have a venomous sting that is fatal to humans and kills the instant it reaches the heart unless a clotting agent is used to thicken it and delay its fatal effects. Manticore venom is one of the deadliest poisons in the known world, and is highly sought after by alchemists, Maesters, and (most of all) assassins. Thus the insects have been imported into private collections across Essos and Westeros: Syrio Forel mentions that he saw one in a menagerie of exotic animals in Braavos, and Daenerys Targaryen sees a caged manticore in the market stalls of Vaes Dothrak.
            When treating Gregor Clegane, Qyburn theorizes that Oberyn used his extensive knowledge of poisons to add a clotting agent to the manticore venom he coated his spear with, thickening it in order to slow its progress through the veins towards the heart, dragging out Gregor's agony. This also explains why Oberyn didn't finish off Gregor when he had the chance: he never intended to give him the mercy of a quick death.
            Within the cultures of Westeros and Essos, the legendary manticore (after which the insect takes its name) is a chimeric creature with a human head, a lion's body, and a scorpion's tail. Dragonstone is adorned with gargoyles in the shape of manticores. A manticore is also the sigil of House Lorch.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Manticores</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascManticores</string></dict>
        <key>Dragons</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.396.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dragons are massive, flying reptiles which can breathe fire onto their enemies and cook their food with the same flame. They are rumored to have a strong connection to magic, which seems to be proven true when magic begins to return to the world after the birth of the first three in over two hundred years. Dragons possess awesome and devastating power, capable of laying waste to armies and burning entire cities to ashes. Men who were able to tame and ride dragons as beasts of war used them to burn their enemies and forge vast empires across the continents of Essos and Westeros.
            The last surviving dragons in the world were possessed by House Targaryen, who used them to conquer and unify the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros three hundred years before the War of the Five Kings. Most of the Targaryen dragons died in the Dance of the Dragons about a century and a half later, and after that, the only dragons the Targaryens were the size cats. Soon after the civil war ended, the last Targaryen dragons died, and the species was considered to be extinct throughout the world.
            At the same time that the War of the Five Kings began in Westeros, Daenerys Targaryen was in possession of three petrified dragons eggs. They were given to her as a wedding gift, still beautiful to look upon. However, she miraculously got the three new dragons to hatch from their eggs, and for the first time in generations, the unique sound of this lost species would be filling the skies of the world with the music of dragons once again.
            Dragons have long serpentine bodies, with proportionately long necks and tails. Their bodies have four limbs: two short back legs and two large wings as forelimbs, a body-plan similar to a bat. In later generations, after the dragons went extinct, physical descriptions of dragons became so confused in memory that artwork sometimes depicted them as having six limbs - two wings growing out of their backs in addition to four legs - but this is inaccurate. The teeth and claws of adult dragons are as long and sharp as swords.
            As reptiles, Dragons are covered in scales, as well as spiny horns which run down their backs from head to tail. Particularly large ridges of horns frame the edges of their faces, running along the back of the skull and along the jawline, which grow bigger as they mature. Adult dragons possess two sets of frills which run along the backs of their necks and spine, two along the sides of their necks and another two centered closer to the backbone, for a total of four frills. These are formed from webbing that grows between longer horny spines. When dragons are agitated (or simply excited), they raise and flare these frills - similar to how a furry animal like a cat will raise the hackles on its back when agitated (or a feathered animal such as a goose will puff up its feathers), in an attempt to appear bigger so as to intimidate its enemies.
            Dragons are also shown to have a variety of calls, from shrieking roars to low growls or hisses. They can even squeal.
            Dragons are obligate carnivores, with diets consisting entirely of meat. Dragons need to roast their prey with their fire-breath before consuming it. Dragons can eat almost any kind of meat, anything from sheep to fish. Historical dragons ridden as beasts of war were known to eat fallen horses and even men on the battlefield. Fully grown dragons could swallow a live horse whole.
            The scale color of dragons is highly variable, and historical dragons ranged in color from black to silver, red, gold, and even blue. Some dragons were one solid color throughout, but more often, they tend to have one primary color for most of their body, with highlights in a secondary color along their spinal crests, horns, and wing membranes. Confirmed markings observed so far include:
            In addition to the various scales hues observed between specimens, dragons also displayed eyes color variations. Dragons being reptiles, they had vertical slit pupils with colored irises. Drogon had red eyes while his brother, Viserion had green eyes.
            Probably the most famous attribute of dragons is their ability to breathe fire. Dragon flame can turn flesh to ash, melt steel, and crack stone. Older dragons can produce more intense flame for longer duration. Dragons seem to produce their fire-breath by expelling chemicals out of two tubes in the back of their throats: when these volatile substances combine, they undergo an intense reaction which bursts into a directed jet of fire. The bodies of dragons are also very resistant to fire, particularly their own flames, which don't even damage their own mouths as they expel them. Some believe that in many ways dragons are fire, fire given form as flesh: it is said that "fire cannot kill a dragon".
            Like most reptiles, dragons lay clutches of eggs. Dragon eggs are roughly the size of a human child's head, and as heavy as stone, so they need to be carried with two hands. The outer shell is covered in scales, with vastly different color patterns between eggs, usually matching the color of the dragon inside. Dragon eggs are notoriously difficult to hatch, though they can maintain the spark of life inside of them for decades if not centuries. The secret key to hatching the eggs seems to involve some form of blood magic: as the House words of the Targaryens hint, it requires "fire and blood". To hatch them, dragon eggs must be burned in roaring flames, with which another creature is simultaneously being burned alive - a life in exchange for a life. In the wild this might just be a prey animal that the parent dragon kills, but human sacrifice will do the trick quite nicely, particularly if there is more than one egg to hatch.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dragons</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDragons</string></dict>
        <key>Shadowcats</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.397.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shadowcats are a large feline apex predator found in Westeros.
            Shadowcats are found in northern Westeros, with larger populations in the lightly inhabited forests of the lands beyond the Wall.[1] However, they are not limited to the lands of the North above the Neck. They are frequently found in wild mountainous areas, with particularly large populations of Shadowcats in the inaccessible areas of the Mountains of the Moon in the Vale of Arryn. They are a frequent danger for travelers on the Eastern Road, crossing over the mountains into the Vale.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Shadowcats have no direct analogue to any real-life species of Big Cat, although they are not quite as remarkable as direwolves. Author George R.R. Martin has stated that while Shadowcats are bigger than cougars, they are not as big as tigers. Shadowcats have thick black fur with white stripes.
            Shadowcats are apparently not as large as lions either. Lions used to inhabit much of Westeros, particularly the hills of the Westerlands, but they were hunted practically to the point of extinction by humans in recent centuries. At one point it is lamented that large animals like direwolves and lions have been pushed out of most of Westeros by human encroachment, which would indicate that Shadowcats aren't as large as lions.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Shadowcats</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascShadowcats</string></dict>
        <key>Direwolves</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.398.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Direwolves are an unusually large and intelligent species of wolf. A grey direwolf on a white field is the sigil of House Stark.
            Direwolves are held to be near-mythical in most of the south of Westeros. Inhabitants of the North acknowledge that they are a real animal, but they are very rarely encountered there. There are some rumors of them living in the Wolfswood near Winterfell, but these are unconfirmed. There may have been larger direwolf populations in the North in past millennia, but centuries of human encroachment on their territory have pushed their range back to the furthest north.
            There have been confirmed sightings north of the Wall by the Night's Watch who guard it. The wildlings who live beyond the Wall claim that direwolves can be found in greater numbers in the Haunted Forest to the north of the Wall. By the reign of King Robert Baratheon, no direwolf had been sighted south of the Wall - even in the Stark lands of the North - in over 200 years.
            After Eddard Stark sentences Will to death for deserting the Night's Watch and carries out the execution, he heads back to Winterfell along with his sons Robb and Bran, his "bastard" son Jon Snow and his adolescent ward Theon Greyjoy. On their journey, they encounter a stag dead in the road, partially disemboweled. Looking for what killed it, they find a dead female direwolf, with an antler piece broken off in her throat. The female died after giving birth, and her five pups huddle by the corpse for warmth.Â Theon advocates killing the pups, but Jon Snow convinces his father that this is an omen: the direwolf is the symbol of House Stark, and Eddard has five trueborn children. With Bran looking on beseechingly, Eddard agrees that his children can have the pups, but only if they raise them themselves with no help from the servants. Just as the party leaves, Jon finds a sixth pup, an albino runt of the litter. Theon mockingly points out that this one belongs to Jon. Further adding to the speculation that the event is an omen is the fact that the pups are revealed to be four males and two females, the same as the Stark children (including Jon).
            When Eddard Stark travels South to King's Landing to serve as Hand of the King, he brings his daughters Sansa and Arya along with their pet Direwolves, Lady and Nymeria. These are the first Direwolves to be seen so far south in hundreds of years. After Nymeria attacks Prince Joffrey, Arya drives her away to escape execution for attacking the Prince; in her place, Lady is killed by Lord Eddard on the command of Robert. Nymeria has been traveling the Riverlands ever since where she leads a pack of gray wolves.
            The other direwolves remained with their masters until they were killed, with the exception of Jon's direwolf Ghost, who is still alive and by Jon's side, but who left him for a period of time when Jon was north of the Wall to explore his natural habitat.
            An adult direwolf is as large as a small horse, and can rip a man's arm from its socket. Even a juvenile direwolf is quite capable of killing a man by ripping out his throat. Physically, they are not simply larger versions of wolves, but have slightly different proportions than their smaller cousins; their heads are larger with a leaner, more pronounced muzzle, their legs are longer in proportion to their body, and they have proportionately larger teeth that are often used to crush bones.
            Direwolves can give birth to litters of at least six pups.
            Direwolves are loyal to their masters and will attack anyone who threatens them. Arya Stark's direwolf Nymeria attacked Prince Joffrey after he threatened her with a sword, while Bran Stark's Summer killed a would-be assassin in Bran's bedroom.[1] They will also come to the aid of those they know are loyal to their masters, since Ghost defended Samwell Tarly and Gilly, both friends of Jon Snow, from Night's Watch bullies, and later prepared to fight alongside Ser Davos Seaworth, Eddison Tollett and a handful of Jon's loyal brothers against the Night's Watch mutineers who betrayed and murdered Jon not long before.
            At the Battle of Oxcross during the War of the Five Kings, Robb Stark's direwolf Grey Wind plays a vital part in Robb's victory, killing several Lannister sentries and panicking their horses.[2] During the Battle of Castle Black, Ghost killed numerous wildlings, among them at least one Thenn.
            The six children of Lord Eddard Stark adopted six orphaned direwolf cubs found in the Wolfswood. They are as follows:
            The nameÂ dire wolfÂ (Latin:Â âCanisÂ dirusâ)Â is given to an actual species of Pleistocene megafauna that once existed on real-life Earth, like the mammoth and sabertooth cat. Dire wolves inhabited the Americas, from 1.8 million years ago to about 10,000 years ago.
            Note that the name of the real-life animal is spelled as two words, "dire wolf", but that the name in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels is consistently spelled as one word, "direwolf".
            The large Pleistocene mammals went extinct when the last ice age ended, roughly 10,000 years ago. Large herbivores such as mammoths died out due to climate change (and possibly hunting by prehistoric humans), and carnivores such as dire wolves died when their food sources disappeared. Dire wolves and mammoths were adapted to the cold ice age climate, their size maximizing heat retention and strength but at the cost of speed. In the warmer climate following the ice age, smaller but faster animals thrived that didn't need to make these tradeoffs for cold weather. Not only did dire wolves' old large prey such as mammoths die out, but they were being out-competed by smaller and faster grey wolves. Dire wolves, however, were not the largest wolves. Currently extant subspecies the Yukon wolf (Canis lupus pambasileus) and the Northwestern wolf (Canis lupus occidentals) were approximately the same size as the dire wolf.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Direwolves</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascDirewolves</string></dict>
        <key>Ravens</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.399.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ravens are a species of large, black-feathered birds native to Westeros.
            Ravens are uncommonly intelligent animals that can be trained to serve as messengers. They can fly great distances at speed, and are used by the maesters of Westeros to pass messages between the castles and cities of the Seven Kingdoms. Through complex training methods, the maesters are able to send messages from almost any castle in Westeros to any other.
            Although most messages brought by ravens are standard and innocuous, they are also linked to ominous tidings, giving rise to the phrase "Dark wings, dark words".
            There is also a cleverer but much rarer species of white raven, which the Conclave of the maesters dispatch from their headquarters at the Citadel in Oldtown only when they agree that the season has turned. This happen in 299 AL, when Summer turned into Autumn, and then again in 303 AL, where winter had officially come.[1]
            Live ravens are used in most shots in which the animals appear in cages, though more complex shots of them flying around often need to use CGI ravens. The rare white raven which Pycelle presented to the Small Council in Season 2 had to be brought in all the way from Austria.[2]
            In the books the messenger-ravens of Westeros often replicate simple human speech in the manner of parrots. Real-life ravens can actually do this, they just aren't coaxed to do it as frequently as pet parrots are. As opposed to parrots, which have high-pitched voices, real-life ravens have a much deeper vocal range and can thus (if given sufficient training) make surprisingly accurate replications of human speech. It is also stated that ravens can speak the "True Tongue", the language of the Children of the Forest, a tongue no human can speak.
            The white ravens used by the maesters of the Citadel are not albinos, but a separate sub-species bred and maintained by the Citadel. This is evidenced by the fact that their eyes are black, not red as in albino animals. White ravens are larger and generally more intelligent than normal ravens, thus why they are bred and used for only the most important messages, particularly notification that the erratic years-long seasons are changing.
            King Baelor Targaryen, in one of his pious delusions, tried to replace all the messenger ravens with doves, but this was unsuccessful. Maester Aemon says at one point that while doves or pigeons can be trained to carry messages, the maesters don't use them because ravens are larger and more clever: they have the physical strength to fly longer distances as well as the intellectual capacity to accurately remember the longer path they must take; they are also able to fend off attacks from hawks much better than smaller doves or pigeons can.
            Ravens and crows are both members of the genus Corvus in real life, but a raven is not a kind of crow. In-universe, Maester Aemon says that "the crow is the raven's poor cousin". There are several differences distinguishing them: ravens are somewhat larger (almost the size of hawks) and have larger bills; crows have a more rounded tail, ravens have a more pointed tail; crows make a high-pitched "caw" sound, while ravens make a low "croak" sound; crows live around 8 years, while ravens can live for 30 years. The collective noun for a group of crows is "a murder of crows", but the collective noun for a group of ravens is actually "an unkindness of ravens" (alternatively, "conspiracy"). Both crows and ravens will eat corpses on a battlefield, but euphemistically "crows" are more often spoken of as carrion-eaters, i.e. that a battle will make "a feast for crows".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ravens</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascRavens</string></dict>
        <key>Lizard-lions</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.400.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lizard-lions are large carnivorous reptiles that live in the bogs and swamps of the Neck in Westeros. House Reed, the ruling house of the Crannogmen, employ as their sigil a black lizard-lion on a grey-green field.[1]
            Lizard-lions are only found in the swamps of the Neck, the narrow isthmus that connects the North to the rest of Westeros.
            Lizard-lions are semi-aquatic reptiles, so-named because they grow to the size of Lions and, like them, are carnivorous.
            Lizard-lions have also been known to attack unwary men who wander through the marshes and bogs of the Neck.
            The Lizard-lion is the sigil of House Reed, a noble house of crannogmen that rules the Neck as vassals of House Stark.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, lizard-lions are the only species of crocodilian known to inhabit the entire continent of Westeros - it is unknown if similar species exist in the other continents. Like their real-life analogues, they are ambush predators that hunt by lying entirely still in the water, resembling floating logs.
            Exactly what kind of crocodilian lizard-lions are supposed to represent is unknown: for some time it was unknown if names such as "crocodile", "alligator", or "caiman" exist in their fictional world.  Therefore it was unclear if "Lizard-lion" was simply their in-universe term for "crocodile", or a unique fictional variant of possibly much larger size.  Author George R.R. Martin has stated that not every species of animal in Westeros has a direct one-for-one equivalent to a real-life species of animal. For example, Martin said that shadowcats have no direct real-life analogue: they are larger than cougars (mountain lions) but smaller than tigers, and don't look quite like either.
            The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014) answered this by referring to both "lizard-lions" in the Neck and "crocodiles" in Sothoryos.  Thus "lizard-lion" isn't simply their term for "crocodiles".  It's possible that lizard-lions are larger than regular crocodile much as direwolves are larger than common wolves - or like shadowcats, they could just be a fantasy variant of other crocodilians.
            Another species of large reptile exists in the jungles of Yi Ti in eastern Essos, known as "basilisks", apparently roughly dog-sized and venomous. Many have been imported to Qarth or Slaver's Bay where they are set against dogs in fighting pits for entertainment. They may be only distantly related to lizard-lions.
            In the first book, as the Stark-Baratheon caravan passes south over the Neck, corresponding to the episode "The Kingsroad", Arya Stark says that she hopes to see a lizard-lion. In the second book, when Meera and Jojen Reed join Bran Stark, Bran is curious about lizard-lions and asks them what they are like, as they don't live in the cold regions north of the swamps.
            Legends about the Marsh Kings of the crannogmen during the Age of Heroes say that they actually rode lizard-lions as mounts, though these are generally dismissed as mere legends.  This may be a distorted memory, however, of skinchangers among the crannogmen magically controlling lizard-lions with their minds.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lizard-lions</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascLizardlions</string></dict>
        <key>Mammoths</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.401.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mammoths are a larger, hairier relatives of elephants. They are the only species of elephant native to Westeros.
            Mammoths inhabit the sub-arctic tundras in the far north of the lands Beyond the Wall. They do not venture as far south as the densely wooded Haunted Forest close to the Wall, and as a result they are rarely seen by the Night's Watch.
            Mammoths have a general body plan similar to elephants, though they possess several distinct features, comparable to the difference between direwolves and regular wolves. Adapted for cold climates, mammoths are covered in long, woolly fur. They are much larger and stronger than regular elephants, and possess disproportionately long, curved tusks, which they can effectively use to combat threats. Mammoths stand a little over 20 feet tall, and are about 15 feet wide and nearly 20 feet long.
            Mammoths are used as mounts by the race of Giants, who inhabit the same range of territory far north of the Wall. The size proportion between a giant and a mammoth is similar to that between a normal man and a horse. The giants have not domesticated mammoths, but have been able to tame large numbers of them. Giants use mammoths as war mounts, though they can also be used as beasts of burden.
            Because no one knows exactly what prehistoric mammoths sounded like, the mammoth roar sound effects used in the TV series were created by using elephant roars combined with other sounds from bears, walruses, and camels. The sounds were tweaked and blended together in various ways to create the different vocalizations.[1]
            From Inside HBO's Game of Thrones: Seasons 3 &amp; 4, pages 178-179, "Creating the Mammoths and Giants":
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, mammoths are ridden as mounts by the giants who live beyond the Wall. The Giants in the novels are very different, inspired by Bigfoot/Sasquatch legends. Covered in shaggy fur themselves, the giants in the books wear no clothing and possess no more advanced technology than wielding logs as clubs (or at most, tying rocks at the end of a club to make a massive, crude but effective maul). The giants' taming of mammoths as mounts is one of their most advanced cultural/technological achievements.
            In the books, Jon Snow actually first saw both mammoths and giants at the same time, when he first entered the main wildling army camp under Mance Rayder: a large column of giants was riding into camp at the time, atop their mammoths. The TV series omitted this (probably for budgetary reasons) and only showed a single giant - but hinting at this detail from the books, the giant is seen constructing a tent out of massive mammoth bones.
            Elephants are fairly common in the warmer parts of Essos, and have been seen in both Slaver's Bay and the southern Free Cities. War elephants are uncommon but not unheard of: The Golden Company possesses its own contingent of war elephants. Volantis, the southernmost Free City, makes extensive use of elephants, as well as using a species of dwarf elephant as both a beast of burden and common means of transport to pull carts, much like horses.
            Mammoths are also said to inhabit the icy wastes of the island of Ibben, far north of mainland Essos. It does not appear that mammoths live anywhere on mainland Essos.
            Nonetheless, mammoths appear to be the only species of pachyderm native to Westeros itself - making such huge beasts even more exotic and impressive to the men of the Night's Watch when they encounter them.
            The mammoths in the narrative are essentially similar to the real-life Pleistocene megafauna Mammoths that once existed on real-life Earth. They first evolved about 5 million years ago and spread across both North America and Eurasia. Like real-life Direwolves, however, they died out at the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago.
            The large Pleistocene mammals went extinct when the last ice age ended: large herbivores like the mammoth died out due to climate change, possibly also combined with hunting by prehistoric humans (humans did hunt mammoths, but how much of a role this played in their overall extinction is debated). Mammoths, like dire wolves, grew to large size as an adaptation for maximizing heat retention, which made them stronger but slower than modern elephants.
            For a time, real-life mammoths did inhabit the same areas as real-life dire wolves (who only inhabited North America), just as both direwolves and mammoths inhabit the same area beyond the Wall in Westeros. Real-life dire wolf packs preyed on mammoths, but there have been no explicit descriptions of this occurring in the narrative (mammoths may be very rare and isolated at this point in Westeros's history).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mammoths</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascMammoths</string></dict>
        <key>Basilisks</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.402.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Basilisks are a kind of carnivorous reptile, native to the jungles in the southern regions of far eastern Essos. Basilisks are venomous, and Basilisk venom is a notable poison used in assassinations.[1] Even Basilisk's blood is poisonous.[2]The species probably give the nameÂ to the Basilisk Isles, where they can be found in.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, basilisks are large, roughly dog-sized venomous reptiles that live in the jungles of Yi Ti, far to the southeast of the Dothraki Sea, across the Bone Mountains. They may also infest the tropical Basilisk Isles off the northern coast of Sothoryos, and also on tropical islands of the Jade Sea (which Yi Ti is on the northwest coast of), the same islands where poisonous Manticore insects are also found.
            While wild basilisks originated in Yi Ti (and possibly other regions around the Jade Sea), they became a very popular animal for use in Fighting pits throughout Essos, made to fight other animals as entertainment. Thus they have been imported into many animal menageries across Essos. When Daenerys Targaryen passes through Qarth she sees a basilisk tearing apart a dog in a fighting pit; they are probably also found in the popular fighting pits in Slaver's Bay.
            Exactly what a basilisk looks like is unclear, or if it is even meant to be analogous to a specific kind of real-life reptile. Because basilisks have been seen set against dogs in fighting pits they would seem to be roughly dog-sized, and therefore smaller than the massive Lizard-lions founds in the swamps of the Neck in Westeros. Due to their relative size and possession of poison, they may be somewhat like Komodo dragons - though they may be more like snakes for all we know.
            The novels have at different points said that both "Basilisk venom" and "Basilisk blood" is poisonous: they might simply both be poisonous.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Basilisks</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascBasilisks</string></dict>
        <key>Nagga</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.403.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the legendary Nagga was said to be so immense that it fed on massive Krakens and drowned islands when it was angered.
            It has never been established that "sea dragons" were ever real creatures. In a world where dragons once stalked the skies, there may be some kernel of truth behind the legends, which were later exaggerated to make Nagga big enough to drown entire islands. On the other hand, "Nagga's Bones", the ruins of the Grey King's old hall, still exist and were used as the site where kingsmoots were held to elect the new King of the Iron Islands (before the kingship became hereditary). Descriptions of Nagga's Bones are vague: according to legend it was made using the massive bones of Nagga as pillars, but the narration doesn't make it clear if these are just pillars of rock that resemble bones, or if "Nagga's Bones" actually are the remaining fossilized bones of some immense animal. Damphair refers to Nagga as the first sea dragon, and that the Drowned God turned her bones to stone.
            When spelled with a single "g", naga refers to a race of serpentine creatures from the Indian sub-continent. Appearing in both Hindu and Buddhist tradition, nagas are associated with both water (similar to Nagga) and the Underworld.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Nagga</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTOtherMascNagga</string></dict>
