        <key>Lucerys Velaryon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.1.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lucerys was the middle son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and her first husband/cousin, Laenor Velaryon. His mother was the first child and daughter of Viserys I Targaryen, who did not change the succession of the Iron Throne upon the birth of his sons. This therefore made Lucerys third in line for the throne. When his grandfather died, his uncle was named Aegon II Targaryen, on the orders of his step-grandmother Alicent Hightower. When Rhaenyra heard the news, the Dance of the Dragons began. By this time, Laenor had presumably died and Lucerys's mother had remarried her uncle Daemon Targaryen, and had two more sons with him. In order to gain more supporters on the mainland of Westeros, Rhaenyra sent him on his dragon, Arrax, to Storm's End. However, by the time he arrived, his uncle Aemond Targaryen was already there, pledging Lord Borros Baratheon to pledge himself to the Greens. However, Lucerys still pleaded his mother's case, but Borros had made his decision. He sent him back to Dragonstone, saying that his bitch of a mother cannot summon him like a dog. Aemond then looked insistingly at Lucerys, his sapphire eye gleaming. This cause him to run out of the castle in a fright. However, he was caught in the middle of a storm whilst leaving, which made is difficult for him to fly very far. Lightning and thunder delayed him. Just then, he heard Vhagar's roar, as he soared throught the clouds with Aemond on his back. Vhagar was five times the size of Arrax. As all of Storm's End watched, Vhagar bit into Arrax neck, eventually decapitating it. With Arrax's lifeless body falling, Lucerys fell into Shipbreaker Bay, only to be consumed by the waves. His mother considered ending the Dance of the Dragons when she heard about this, but his stepfather/great-uncle Daemon had other ideas.[1]
            
            King Viserys I Targaryen was delighted with Luke when he was presented at court. In 118 AC Rhaenyra Targaryen announced the betrothal of her eldest sons, Jacaerys and Lucerys, to Rhaena and Baela Targaryen, the daughters of Prince Daemon Targaryen and Laena Velaryon.
            When Prince Aemond Targaryen attempted to ride Vhagar, one of House Targaryen's dragons, he was confronted by the Velaryon brothers. Aemond broke the nose of five-year-old Luke, who eventually took out Aemond's eye with his dagger.
            When Lord Corlys Velaryon fell ill, Rhaenyra wanted him to name Luke as his heir to Driftmark, as his elder brother Jacaerys was in the line of succession to the Iron Throne.
            Prince Lucerys and Arrax are killed by Prince Aemond Targaryen and Vhagar, as depicted by Chase Stone in The World of Ice and Fire.
            Prior to the Dance of the Dragons Lucerys had long served as a squire. He was fourteen years old at the start of the civil war.
            Luke was sent on a mission that was considered shorter and safer than his brother Jacaerys's, flying on Arrax as a messenger to Storm's End where it was expected that Lord Borros Baratheon would give him a warm welcome. Prior to his mission he swore on the Seven-Pointed Star to his mother on Dragonstone that he would take no part in fighting.
            Once at Storm's End tragedy befell Lucerys, as Prince Aemond Targaryenhad already arrived at the castle on Vhagar. Upon his arrival in the Round Hall Luke ignored Aemond and went to deliver his letter to Borros. The Lord of Storm's End asked Luke, "And if I do as your mother bids, which one of my daughters will you marry, boy?" He then told him to pick one of his four daughters standing in the Round Hall. When Luke admitted he was betrothed to his cousin, Rhaena Targaryen, Borros replied that he thought as much and told him to go home.
            Aemond drew his sword but Lucerys told him he came as an envoy, not aknight. Lucerys was escorted back to the castle yard where Arrax waited amidst a terrible storm. In the Round Hall, Borros granted Aemond's request to leave. Arrax was struggling to stay aloft as Aemond mounted Vhagar and went after Luke. Arrax was younger and swifter, and on a calm day might have been able to outfly his pursuer, but the weather impeded him and Vhagar was five times the size of her foe and the hardened survivor of a hundred battles.
            The two dragons met above Shipbreaker Bay. According to Archmaester Gyldayn, if there was a fight it could not have lasted long. Arrax fell, broken, to be swallowed by the storm-lashed waters of the bay. His head and neck washed up beneath the cliffs below Storm's End three days later. Prince Lucerys's corpse washed up as well.
            On Dragonstone, Rhaenyra collapsed when told of his death and Luke's younger brother Joffrey swore a terrible oath of vengeance against Aemond and Borros. As the black council sat to consider how to strike back, a raven arrived from Harrenhal. "An eye for an eye, a son for a son," Prince Daemon wrote. "Lucerys shall be avenged".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lucerys_Velaryon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascLucerysVelaryon</string></dict>

            Ulf was one of the Targaryen bastards from Dragonstone recruited as a dragon-rider for Rhaenyra Targaryen due to his heritage, and rode the dragon Silverwing. After Aegon II's loyalists besieged Tumbleton, Rhaenyra sent Ulf and fellow dragon-rider Hugh Hammer to relieve her garrison. However, the two instead burned Rhaenyra's troops and defected to Aegon's side, drinking and whoring with his troops after taking Tumbleton.[1]

        <key>Aerys II Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.3.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Aerys II Targaryen, popularly called "the Mad King", was the last member of House Targaryen to rule from the Iron Throne. He was formally styled as Aerys of the House Targaryen, the Second of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Although his rule began benevolently, he succumbed to madness and was eventually deposed by Lord Robert Baratheon in a civil war. Aerys was infamously murdered by a member of his own Kingsguard, Ser Jaime Lannister, during Lord Tywin Lannister's Sack of King's Landing. This act earned Ser Jaime the nickname "Kingslayer" for slaying the king that he was sworn to protect as a member of the Kingsguard.
            Aerys's two surviving children, Viserys and Daenerys, were smuggled across the Narrow Sea to the Free Cities of Essos, while his last living grandson, Jon Snow, was raised as his maternal uncle Eddard Stark's bastard son to protect him from Robert's wrath. Viserys and Daenerys are intent on one day returning to Westeros to reclaim what they regard as their birthright.
            Aerys fought for his father, Aegon V Targaryen, in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. He took on the tradition of Targaryen inbreeding in order to keep bloodlines pure. After his father and brother died at the tragedy of Summerhall, he became Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name. He later became spiteful of the power of others, especially that of his Hand of the King, Tywin Lannister (who had once been one of his closest friends). He later became paranoid of his own family members and his Small Council. Popularly remembered as "the Mad King", his reign became increasingly erratic and murderous.
            Despite the fact that nobody expected Aerys to turn up, he suddenly arrived at The Great Tourney at Harrenhal. During this tourney, Aerys knighted Ser Jaime Lannister and admitted him to the Kingsguard, but not for his valor and honor. Instead, he wanted to spite his Hand of the King, Tywin Lannister. His eldest son, Rhaegar Targaryen, competed in the tourney, and after winning, he shunned his own wife, Elia Martell, and laid his winning roses in the lap of Lyanna Stark of Winterfell.
            A final round of blood-letting began when Rhaegar, allegedly kidnapped Lyanna, prompting many houses in the realm to rebel. Brandon Stark protested the abduction of his sister and demanded justice. Aerys had him arrested for treason and then offered to ransom him to his father. However, when Rickard Stark rode to King's Landing as he was bid to ransom Brandon, Aerys had him arrested too, and then brutally executed both father and son.[1]
            In response, the noble houses of Stark, Tully, Arryn, and Baratheon raised the flags of rebellion and destroyed the royalist armies in several major engagements, culminating in the Battle of the Trident where Prince Rhaegar died at the hands of Lyanna's betrothed Robert Baratheon, the leader of the rebels.
            King Aerys was betrayed by his former friend and King's Hand, Lord Tywin Lannister, who led an army under the false pretense of defending the capital at King's Landing. When Aerys opened the gates, Tywin proceeded to brutally sack the city. Meanwhile, Jaime, stabbed Aerys in the back and then cut his throat.[2]
            Aerys's death brought an end to the Targaryen dynasty, which had ruled the Seven Kingdoms for three centuries. He was replaced on the Iron Throne by Robert Baratheon. However, the Targaryen bloodline survived through his grandson, Jon Snow, who was passed off as a bastard of Winterfell by his maternal uncle Eddard Stark, and his two youngest children, Viserys and Daenerys, who were spirited away to the Free Cities.
            As they travel to King's Landing, King Robert talks about having Aerys's daughter Daenerys assassinated after hearing of her marriage to Khal Drogo. When Eddard protests, Robert reminds him of what Aerys did to his family. Later at the Crossroads Inn, Sandor Clegane tells Sansa Stark about how Ser Ilyn Payne hasn't had much to say since Aerys had Ser Ilyn's tongue torn out.[3]
            When Eddard arrives in the Great Hall of the Red Keep, he is confronted by Ser Jaime Lannister, who expresses his bitterness at Eddard for judging him over his killing of Aerys, especially after he killed Eddard's father and brother. Eddard counters that Jaime wasn't motivated by justice when he killed Aerys, and that he had served him loyally when serving was safe.[4]
            Ser Barristan Selmy of the Kingsguard recounts to King Robert I Baratheon how Aerys ordered him to destroy the Kingswood Brotherhood. Selmy himself killed their leader, Simon Toyne. Bored and attempting to mock Ser Jaime, King Robert realizes that he never asked Jaime what King Aerys Targaryen's last words were, then taunts Jaime for killing a defenseless old man he had sworn to protect. Jaime tersely responds that the last thing the Mad King said was the same thing he'd been raving for hours, since the sack of the capital by the rebels began: "Burn them all!" This silences Robert's levity.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aerys_II_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAerysIITargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aemond Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.4.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Prince Aemond Targaryen, also known as Aemond One-Eye or Aemond the Kinslayer, was a Prince of the Targaryen dynasty.
            At some point, Aemond lost his left eye and replaced it with a sapphire. When his mother Alicent Hightower proclaimed Aemond's brother Aegon II Targaryen as King, Aemond flew on his dragon Vhagar in order to gain the allegiance of lords that hadn't yet declared for him. During the Dance of the Dragons, he arrived at Storm's End to prevail of the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands for his support of the Greens, where he was unhappily reunited with his nephew Lucerys Velaryon, who pleded that he join his mother, Rhaenyra Targaryen. However, Borros Baratheon chose the Greens as an ally. On Lucerys's way back from Dragonstone, Aemond and Vhagar killed Lucerys's dragon, Arrax, and Lucerys was consumed by the waves below in the process. He later rode Vhagar again along with his brother, who rode Sunfyre at Rook's Rest, where Rhaenys and her dragon Meleys perished, where Aemond and Vhagar were the only ones uninjured. His brother was then crippled, and had to constantly use Milk of the poppy. Aemond then commanded the royal army of the Green, and marched them North to take back Harrenhal from his uncle Daemon. However, upon arrival, they discovered that the castle was empty, and feasted to their victory. However, since him and his dragon were left at Harrenhal, this allowed Daemon and Rhaenyra to take the Iron Throne. Upon realising his mistake, he rode back to King's Landing and burned all those he suspected of disloyalty. After receiving a challenge from his uncle, Aemond dueled Daemon to the death in the Battle Above the Gods Eye. As their dragons tumbled towards the Gods Eye, Daemon plunged Dark Sister through Aemond's one remaining eye, and through his neck, his corpse later hit the waters below.[1]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aemond was the second son of King Viserys I Targaryen and Queen Alicent Hightower and the brother of King Aegon II Targaryen.
            After Laena Velaryon died, when Aemond was only ten years old he became the new rider of the mighty Vhagar, the oldest and largest living dragon. After Laena's funeral, the two factions of House Targaryen both visited Dragonstone: Queen Alicent and her children, and Princess Rhaenyra and her children. They had hoped for Aemond to bond with a new hatchling there, but instead he snuck off and successfully rode Vhagar - over the protests of Rhaenyra's three eldest sons (who were only six, five, and three years old), who didn't want her mother's enemies to gain such a powerful dragon. When Aemond returned to the ground, his flight permanently bonding him with Vhagar, the other three boys attacked him, culminating when six year old Lucerys stabbed him with a dagger in his left eye. In later years Aemond said he may have lost his eye that day but in return he gained the great Vhagar, and he considered it a fair trade. Afterwards he often put a smoothed sapphire as a false eye in his empty socket.
            Despite the loss of his eye Aemond went on to become one of the most fearsome swordsmen in all of Westeros, as he spent the next ten years being trained by Ser Criston Cole, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
            Aemond was nineteen when his father, King Viserys I Targaryen died, sparking the great civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. His mother Alicent had long planned for Aegon II to usurp the throne ahead of his older sister Rhaenyra upon Viserys I's death. When word of his passing spread throughout the castle, Aemond's younger brother wept at the news of his father's death. In contrast, the news reached Aemond as he was in the armory donning armor for his morning in the practice yard, and upon hearing it his sole, blunt reply was "Is Aegon king, or must we kneel and kiss the old whore's cunt?"
            At the beginning of the war Aemond flew Vhagar to Storm's End, to win the loyalty of Lord Borros Baratheon by wedding one of his daughters. Rhaenyra's second son Lucerys also arrived, on his dragon Arrax, with the same goal of winning over the Baratheons. Lucerys, however, only asked Borros to join Rhaenyra for the sake of his past oaths, and said he could not wed one of his daughters because he was already betrothed. so Borros spurned his offer. Aemond moved to attack Lucerys but Borros sharply forbade him from shedding the blood of an envoy that he had accepted under his roof - though he said what Aemond did outside his castle was not his concern. Lucerys mounted Arrax and left, but he was soon chased down by Aemond on Vhagar over Shipbreaker Bay; Arrax was only a young dragon and Vhagar quickly overpowered him, killing beast and rider. For killing his own half-nephew, Aemond became known as the Kinslayer.
            Aemond and Vhagar's next major fight was in the Battle of Rook's Rest, where Aegon II's armies set a trap for Rhaenys Targaryen riding the dragon Maelys. Shen she arrived, she was ambushed two-on-one by Aegon II riding Sunfyre and Aemond on Vhagar. Even so, Maelys was a large dragon and did not go down without a fight: at the end of their fall to the ground, Vhagar was relatively unharmed, but Sunfyre was crippled and nearly killed. Aegon II himself was burned over half of his body, leaving him semi-conscious for the next full year as he slowly recovered. In his stead, at Alicent's behest Aemond stepped up to become Prince Regent and Protector of the Realm, though he did not attempt to claim the title of "king" ahead of his incapacitated brother.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aemond_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAemondTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aenys Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.5.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aenys I Targaryen was the second King of the Andals and the First Men during the Targaryen dynasty. He was formally styled as Aenys of House Targaryen, the First of His Name.
            King Aegon the Conqueror had two children by his two sister-wives: his firstborn son Aenys with his sister Queen Rhaenys, and his second-born son Maegor with his sister Queen Visenya. When Aegon I eventually died, Aenys succeeded him as the second king on the Iron Throne.
            The Conquest was still within living memory, however, and many still chafed under Targaryen rule - and saw the death of Aegon I as an opportunity to throw off their rule. Several localized rebellions therefore broke out at the beginning of Aensys's reign, such as the insurrection of the "Vulture King" in the Red Mountains along the border with independent Dorne, but these uprisings were ultimately put down - not really due to Aenys's leadership, but capable local rulers such as House Tarly, among others.[1]
            The Targaryens had incestuously married brother to sister for generations (whenever possible) to "keep the bloodline pure", in the custom of their Valyrian ancestors - which the Faith of the Seven in Westeros considered an abomination. For that matter, Aegon I broke not only the Faith's rules against incest, but its rules against polygamy, as he was married to both of his sisters at the same time.
            To the surprise of all, however, later in his reign King Aenys tactlessly wed his daughter to his own son: the incestuous marriage of Princess Rhaena and Prince Aegon broke the Targaryens' prior promise to the Faith, which could stand the abomination no longer. The new High Septon led the denunciation of the Targaryens, and the military order of the Faith of the Seven, the Faith Militant, rose up in open revolt.[2]
            Instead of his own children, Aenys was then succeeded by his younger half-brother Maegor, Aegon I's only child by Visenya. Maegor was his brother's exact opposite: a highly skilled warrior and brutal tyrant, quickly earning him the name "Maegor the Cruel".[2]
            Maegor ultimately died childless, however, and Aenys's youngest son succeeded to the throne as King Jaehaerys I: hence all subsequent Targaryen monarchs descended from Aenys, not Maegor.
            Aenys's name is briefly seen on a page of the book "The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms" when Lord Eddard Stark is searching through it. On a page about House Baratheon, it is mentioned that one of Orys Baratheon's sons, a member of the Kingsguard, died thwarting an assassination attempt against Aenys.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aenys was the first son of Aegon the Conqueror and Queen Rhaenys, before she died fighting in Dorne. Maegor, meanwhile, was the son and only child of Queen Visenya, Aegon's other sister-wife, making him Aenys's half-brother.
            George R.R. Martin made Targaryen dynasty names by mix-and-matching different name elements: "Ae-" in "Aegon", "Aemon", "Aemond", "Aerion", etc., and the suffix "-nys" from "Rhaenys" (less clearly, "Viserys" and "Daenerys"). In-universe, Aenys's name is apparently simply a combination of his parents' names: "Ae-gon" and "Rhae-nys" yielded "Ae-nys". It is pronounced like both elements in his parents' names: "AY-nis", but not "Ay-nus".[4]
            Aenys was considered to be a weakling. He was as tall as his father but softer looking, slender and frail. He was very sickly as a child. His mother Rhaenys died when he was only three years old, which deeply traumatized him. He grew somewhat stronger and more confident after bonding to his dragon Quicksilver (progeny of the original three dragons brought to Westeros during the Conquest). Like his mother, Aenys enjoyed court life and was a great patron of the arts: he was dabbler in poetry and alchemy, though not much of an academic. Nonetheless he was quite charming on a personal level at court, in contrast with his brutish younger half-brother. He wore his hair long down to his shoulders, curled into ringlets and perfumed. He also had a thin silky moustache and beard, well-manicured to come to a fine point (described as a "Three Musketeers" look by Martin). He wore a large gold crown much bigger than his father's simple band of Valyrian steel interlaid with large square-cut rubies. Despite being a courtier, he was not very charismatic in times of actual crisis, as those around him became disgusted at his weak will and indecision. He had a nervous smile, as if anxious and eager to please those around him.
            Aenys wasn't a completely foppish incompetent (this reputation became somewhat exaggerated over time): he did well enough at jousting and feats of arms not to embarrass himself, he wasn't just tripping over his sword, but he was only adequate - in contrast with the great legacy of his father. Aenys might have made a decent enough caretaker king if he had inherited the throne in a time of peace - he may not have been a great statesman but he wasn't outright insane (like Aerys II), a religious buffoon (like Baelor I), or a cruel tyrant (as Maegor later became). The Targaryen dynasty was still young, however, and needed a forceful king to cement its status - and Aenys failed to rise to the occasion.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aenys_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAenysTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aerion Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.6.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aerion Targaryen was a Prince of the Targaryen dynasty.
            Aerion was a Prince of the Targaryen dynasty. His parents were Maekar I Targaryen and Dyanna Dayne. He was the older brother of Aemon and Aegon Targaryen, who would ascend to Iron Throne as Aegon V.
            Despite the fact that both his father and grandfather broke with the Targaryen custom of marrying brother to sister "to keep the bloodline pure", Aerion still succumbed to the madness that plagued many members of his family due to multiple generations of compound inbreeding. He ultimately killed himself by drinking wildfire, believing it would transmute him into a dragon.[1]
            Touring the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing, King Joffrey Baratheon points out to Margaery Tyrell the urn containing what little remains of ​Aerion Brightflame. He briefly explains who he was and the manner of his death.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aerion Targaryen is remembered as an example of the madness that can befall the members of House Targaryen, believing himself a dragon in human form, and had a rather cruel streak that would lead him to be nicknamed Aerion the Monstrous. In his youth, Aerion was slim and of average height with curly silver-hair, a statuesque face of sharp cheekbones, straight nose, pale skin, and violet eyes.
            Aerion's brothers were not fond of him, particularly Aegon. At some point of Aegon's childhood, Aerion threw his cat down a well and stole into his chambers with a knife and threatened to castrate Aegon to get a sister he could marry. After the events of the Ashford Tourney, which led to the death of Maekar's brother Baelor, Aerion was sent to Lys, where he may have fathered some bastard children. During his exile he also served with the Second Sons, a mercenary company.
            In all fairness, Aerion did not simply have a fit of madness one day in which he decided that drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon: he was actually very drunk at the time. He was always quite arrogant and unstable, but under normal circumstances was not outright delusional.
            Aerion married his first cousin, Daenora Targaryen - the only surviving child of his uncle Rhaegel Targaryen, who was widely believed to have been insane (not sadistic like Aerion, but is said that he was seen dancing naked through the Red Keep). Aerion had one child by Daenora, a son, that in a display of pique and arrogance he named "Maegor" - after his ancestor, the infamous tyrant King Maegor the Cruel. The first Maegor's memory was so despised that the Targaryens had avoided naming any of their sons "Maegor" again for the previous two hundred years (in real life terms it is comparable to how the English monarchy never named a son "John" again after King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, or like naming a prince "Nero" after Emperor Nero).
            Aerion died drinking wildfire in 232 AC, and his father Maekar died only a few months later that same year. Aerion's son Maegor was still just an infant, and it was feared by many that the son had inherited the father's madness (and possibly also his mother's father's madness). At the Great Council convened to determine the succession, only a few spoke up for Aerion's son and he was quickly passed over as a candidate. It also passed over the only heir of Maekar's eldest son Daeron, a ten-year-old girl named Vaella who while sweet was mentally disabled. Maekar's third son Aemon had become a maester, leaving his fourth son Aegon V to inherit the throne (though due to Aegon V's populist leanings there were many among the nobility who pressured that Aemon should be released from his vows to inherit ahead of him, but Aemon flatly refused to have any part in this, and joined the Night's Watch).
            Aerion Brightflame is one of the main antagonists in the first entry in the Tales of Dunk and Egg series of prequel novellas set 90 years before the War of the Five Kings. He is a major opponent of Ser Duncan the Tall, and challenges him to a trial by combat - or rather, a rare "trial of seven" variant in which two sides of seven men fight each other. Aerion Brightflame would thus appear in any potential TV adaptation of the prequels.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aerion_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAerionTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aerys I Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.7.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aerys I Targaryen was the first of his name to sit the Iron Throne and the thirteenth King of the Targaryen dynasty.
            Aerys Targaryen was the first of his name to sit the Iron Throne and the thirteenth King of the Targaryen dynasty. He was the son of King Daeron the Good and Queen Myriah and succeeded his father after he perished in the Great Spring Sickness since his elder brother Baelor died before that after fighting in the Trial by Seven of Duncan the Tall. Per the Targaryen tradition, he took his own sister Aelinor as his wife. His other brothers were Rhaegel and Maekar, who would succeed him to the Iron Throne.
            Aerys, along with his brothers and sister, is mentioned in House Targaryen's entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aerys I Targaryen is described as bookish. He was spindly and stooped, with long, straight hair. He had a long, thin face, a long, thin mustache and a long pointed beard. He inherited the Iron Throne after the Great Spring Sickness took not only his father Daeron, but also his nephews Valarr and Matarys, the sons of his elder brother, Prince Baelor "Breakspear", who had perished earlier defending Duncan the Tall in a Trial of Seven - a particular form of trial by combat.
            Aerys only had three brothers and no sisters. His wife Aelinor was in fact of no relation to him other than being a distant cousin, and she was of House Penrose of Parchments from The Stormlands. He also appointed his uncle Brynden Rivers as Hand of the King and left the governance of the realm to him, while he occupied himself with the study of books and lore. He also shunned the bed of his wife Aelinor. During this time, no one great disaster befell the realm, but it was beset by numerous minor problems which were allowed to flourish all at once due to Aerys I's inept reign. Following the great plague which killed Aerys I's father, the realm suffered a great drought, leading to famine even in breadbasket regions such as the Reach. This instability led to a great proliferation of broken men and highway robbers, and the roads were not considered safe to travel. Meanwhile, the pretenders of House Blackfyre who had fled across the Narrow Sea remained an ongoing threat. There were as many as five Blackfyre Rebellions in all, the first and greatest of which occurred during the reign of Aerys I's father. Even so, the surviving Blackfyres were continually plotting new intrigues and rebellions to take the throne back, leading to the short-lived Second Blackfyre Rebellion which occurred three years into Aerys I's reign. In addition, the Lord of the Iron Islands, Dagon Greyjoy, took advantage of the chaos of the spring sickness and the Iron Throne's preoccupation with the Blackfyre rebels under Bittersteel, and raided Fair Isle, the Arbor, and even the North. Other localized rebellions of opportunity popped up throughout the kingdoms trying to take advantage of the general instability, including a revolt by the island of Skagos against Winterfell, and an attempt by the wildlings to invade south of the Wall by a new King-Beyond-the-Wall. Aerys I is overall remembered as a weak, absentee-king whose time on the throne was marked by plague, famine, Blackfyre intrigues from the Free Cities, ironborn raiding, wildling invasions, and other localized rebellions.
            After Aerys's death, his brother Maekar inherited the throne, as Aerys had no heir, and their brother Rhaegel predesceased them and was insane besides. Rhaegel had three children, but his only son died shortly after his father.
            Aerys I is king during much of the timeframe of the Tales of Dunk and Egg prequel novellas, which begin 90 years before the War of the Five Kings and follow the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall and Aegon "Egg" Targaryen. Aerys's father Daeron II died between the first and second prequel novellas, after which Aerys ascended the throne, and the second novella shows the deteriorating conditions during Aerys I's inept reign (with widespread plague, drought, and bandits). Aerys I might appear in any potential live-action adaptation of the prequel novellas.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aerys_I_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAerysITargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aegon Targaryen </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.8.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Prince Aegon Targaryen was a member of House Targaryen and was the eldest son of King Aenys Targaryen.
            Prince Aegon was named after his grandfather, Aegon I Targaryen (known as "Aegon the Conqueror").
            Ultimately Prince Aegon was wed to his own sister Rhaena by her father King Aenys, according to Valyrian custom. The leadership of the Faith of the Seven, who already had strained relations with the crown, condemned this incestuous union, and the Faith Militant revolted against the Targaryens.[1]
            His younger brother Jaehaerys, who married their other sister Alysanne, ultimately assumed the throne after the death of their half-uncle Maegor the Cruel as Aegon had perished sometime before. Had Aegon assumed the throne before his death, he would have ruled as "Aegon II". Given that he did not, ultimately Jaehaerys's great-grandson ascended the throne as "Aegon II" nearly a century later.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Prince Aegon was the eldest son and second-born child of King Aenys, after his sister Rhaena. He was named after his grandfather, Aegon the Conqueror. Author George R.R. Martin made it a point that names often repeat in real-life royal dynasties - his prior work in television had strictly forbid re-using names for fear that this might confuse the audience, but he found this unrealistic. Moreover, many royal names were re-used for princes who never actually ruled (i.e. "Edward the Black Prince" during the Hundred Years War pre-deceased his father and thus isn't in the official number count of kings named "Edward"). In his own words, Martin explained:
            King Aegon I, the Conqueror, had maintained a polygamous marriage with both of his sisters: Aenys's mother Rhaenys and Maegor's mother Visenya. Aegon himself always treated Aenys as his heir apparent because he was older than Maegor - though given young Aenys's frailty, there were some who muttered that Maegor should be his heir, given that he was his "firstborn" by Visenya - those who said this were chiefly Visenya herself, and her supporters, though Aegon I would hear none of it.
            Thus, the birth of Aenys's own children pushed Maegor even further back in the line of succession, as by the normal laws of Westeros an uncle only inherits after his elder brother's entire bloodline is extinguished. For that matter, as the years passed Maegor failed to produce any heir, and there were fears that he was sterile - causing him to lose supporters, who didn't think it was worth upsetting Aegon I's intended succession for an heir who couldn't continue the family line anyway.
            Aegon I was still wary of offending the Faith of the Seven, and promised them that his family's incestuous marriage practices were a relic of the past which they wouldn't continue in the future. To assure him of this, he had Aenys marry Alyssa Velaryon as a political match, who was mother to all of his children. Maegor's mother Visenya didn't give up on her ambitions in court politics, however, pushing for Maegor to one day succeed ahead of Aenys. Thus when Rhaena was born, Visenya urged Aegon I to betroth her to her Maegor, her own half-uncle. Aegon I, however, dismissed the suggestion - both because he didn't want to risk offending the Faith with such an incestuous marriage, and (it is believed) because he had become frustrated with Visenya's constant attempts to usurp Rhaenys's son Aenys with her own.
            Prince Aegon was born in 26 AC, and his father announced his marriage to his older sister Rhaena in 41 AC - when he was 15 years old and his sister was 18 years old (when Prince Aegon was around the same age that Robb Stark was in the second novel). No one knows exactly why Aenys launched into such an obvious folly, given how strained his relations with the Faith already were: some suspect that as the Red Keep's construction grew, he began to think on the glorious Targaryen legacy he would leave behind, and thus he gave more focus to "keeping the bloodline pure".
            Prince Aegon and Rhaena were making a royal progress through the realm when the Faith Militant uprising struck: they were in the Westerlands at the time, and were besieged in Crakehall castle. Within a few weeks, their father Aenys fled to Dragonstone and died in 42 AC (possibly poisoned by Visenya). Maegor then retook King's Landing using Balerion, and usurped the throne ahead of Prince Aegon (and Aenys's other four children). The Lannisters extended Aegon and Rhaena Guest right but would not rise against Maegor, leaving them stranded for some time. It was difficult for Maegor to pursue them due to having to devote much of his attention to campaigns against the Faith Militant in central Westeros.
            In 43 AC, Prince Aegon himself rallied an army to rebel against his half-uncle Maegor, riding Aenys's own dragon Quicksilver. They clashed in the great Battle Beneath the God's Eye, but Maegor rode the awesome Balerion, killing both Quicksilver and Aegon.
            In the intervening years Rhaena had given birth to twin daughters, Aerea and Rhalla, and she fled with them to Fair Isle off the west coast for some time. They were ultimately found, however, and taken captive back to Maegor's court at King's Landing, where she was forced to marry him as one of his "black brides". She later escaped on her dragon Dreamfyre and rallied to Aenys's last surviving son, Jaehaerys I Targaryen. Rhaena actually outlived Maegor, though no information has been given so far on her subsequent life, or that of Prince Aegon's twin daughters.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_Targaryen_(son_of_Aenys)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAegonTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aemon Targaryen </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.9.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Prince Aemon Targaryen was a Prince of the Targaryen dynasty and the namesake of Maester Aemon. He was the uncle of Maester Aemon's grandfather, King Daeron II.
            Prince Aemon was called "the Dragonknight" on account of his heritage. He was raised to the Kingsguard at age 17 and eventually became Lord Commander. According to tradition, he was once saved from a snake pit by his cousin Baelor I Targaryen, whom the snakes refused to bite. He fought and barely defeated Lord Cregan Stark. He also wielded Dark Sister, the Valyrian steel sword of Visenya Targaryen.[1]
            Aemon the Dragonknight's deeds are recorded in The Book of Brothers.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aemon was knighted young and joined the Kingsguard at the age of seventeen. He served under five kings: His uncle Aegon III Targaryen, his cousins Daeron the Young Dragon and Baelor the Blessed, his father Viserys II, and his brother Aegon the Unworthy. Aemon has been referred to as the noblest and greatest knight that ever lived and his skills with a sword were legendary throughout Westeros.
            Aemon took part in the conquest of Dorne, led by his cousin and king, Daeron I. Aemon won great fame by defeating a Dornish champion, and was present several years later after a rebellion in Dorne undid Daeron's conquest, and in which Daeron himself was killed. Aemon was taken captive by the Dornish, stripped naked, and put in a cage placed above a pit filled with vipers. He was eventually saved by his cousin and new king, Baelor I.
            Songs speak of his doomed love for his brother's queen, his own sister, Naerys. He supposedly cried when Naerys married their brother. After his brother Aegon became king, rumors started to spread that Aemon was the actual father of Aegon's son and heir, Prince Daeron. He defended his sister when she was accused of treason by the knight Ser Morgil.
            Aemon once fought Cregan Stark. Prince Aemon claimed he had never faced a finer swordsman.
            Aemon once won a tourney, disguised as a mystery knight, after his brother had forbidden him from participating because he wanted to name his mistress at the time the Queen of Love and Beauty. Aemon took part secretly under the disguise of The Knight of Tears, and was thus able to crown his sister Naerys the Queen of Love and Beauty, in place of the king's mistress.
            Despite the difficult relationship between Aemon and his brother, Aemon died honorably defending his brother and king from the brothers of Ser Terrence Toyne, who wanted to assassinate Aegon IV in revenge for him executing Terrence for sleeping with his mistress.
            Maester Aemon states that he was explicitly named after Aemon the Dragonknight, the uncle of his grandfather Daeron II - though Maester Aemon notes there are those who said that the Dragonknight was actually Daeron II's own father, depending on which tale you believe.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aemon_Targaryen_(Dragonknight)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAemonTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aegor Rivers</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.10.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aegor Rivers was one of the infamous Great Bastards of King Aegon IV Targaryen, also known as "Aegon the Unworthy". He is the founder of the Golden Company, a sellsword company in Essos composed primarily of Westerosi exiles.
            Aegor, along with his siblings is mentioned in the House Targaryen entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aegor Rivers was often called "Bittersteel". While King Aegon IV had many bastard children, the mothers of four of them were also noblewomen, which encouraged him to formally acknowledge them. The four Great Bastards were Daemon Blackfyre (whose mother, secretly, was Daena Targaryen), Aegor "Bittersteel" Rivers (whose mother was a member of House Bracken), Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers (whose mother was a member of House Blackwood), and Shiera Seastar (whose mother was Serenei of Lys, from an ancient Valyrian noble family).
            On his deathbed, Aegon IV foolishly had them all legitimized, which led to strife between them and his legitimate heir King Daeron II, tensions which ultimately split realm apart in the devastating civil war known as the Blackfyre Rebellion.
            Bittersteel sided with his half-brother Daemon Blackfyre, while his other half-brother Bloodraven sided with their half-brother King Daeron II Targaryen. Bittersteel and Bloodraven hated each other, because they both competed for the love of their half-sister Shiera Seastar. Bloodraven asked her to marry him dozens of times and she refused, but she did let him into her bed - though she had many lovers. Shiera, however, completely rejected Bittersteel, and for this he never forgave Bloodraven. It also didn't help that Bittersteel's mother was a Bracken and Bloodraven's mother was a Blackwood, as those two noble families had been feuding for thousands of years. Bittersteel became a great champion and general for the Blackfyres, while Bloodraven became a great champion and general for the Targaryens.
            The First Blackfyre Rebellion ended with the Battle of Redgrass Field, in which Daemon Blackfyre and his eldest two sons were slain. Bittersteel survived, and became one of the major leaders of the surviving Blackfyre forces as they fled into exile in the Free Cities. Daemon left behind five sons and multiple daughters, so Bittersteel became their guardian, secreting them across the Narrow Sea with his dwindling followers.
            While in the Free Cities, many of Bittersteel's remaining men deserted to join mercenary companies. In response, Bittersteel resorted to forming his remaining soldiers into their own mercenary company, called the Golden Company. Day by day and year by year they fought in the petty wars between the different Free Cities in order to make enough money for their basic upkeep. This step at least ensured that the Blackfyre Pretenders would have some semblance of a stable core fighting force whenever they mounted a new plot to invade Westeros. In time, the Golden Company became the largest and most skilled mercenary company in the Free Cities.
            From the Free Cities, Bittersteel continued to plot new invasions of the Seven Kingdoms for at least forty years. After the first (and greatest) rebellion failed in 196 AL, he took no part in the Second Blackfyre Rebellion in 212 AL- which was more of a failed plot than an actual war - which was instigated by Daemon II Blackfyre. Afterwards, Bloodraven imprisoned Daemon II but kept him alive, to discourage Bittersteel from crowning Daemon II's younger brother Haegon as the new head of House Blackfyre. Bittersteel was briefly taken captive after the failure of the Third Blackfyre Rebellion, and brought to the Red Keep in chains. He was found guilty of high treason, and while Bloodraven and Prince Aerion urged King Aerys I Targaryen to execute Bittersteel, Aerys instead chose to send him to the Wall; however, Aegor's allies captured the ship transporting him to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and freed him to return to Essos. Eventually, Bittersteel even took part in the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion in the year 236 AL, in which the Golden Company crossed the Narrow Sea and landed on Massey's Hook (in the southeastern Crownlands, near the border with the northern Stormlands). By this time, however, they had very little support. Daemon III Blackfyre was personally killed by Ser Duncan the Tall in battle and the rebellion ended.
            Bittersteel eventually died and ordered the other members of the Golden Company to preserve his skull in gold. Subsequent commanders of the Company have followed his example.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aegor_Rivers</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAegorRivers</string></dict>
        <key>Aegon I Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.11.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Aegon I Targaryen, known as Aegon the Conqueror, was the founder and first king of the Targaryen dynasty when he conquered all of Westeros and united the realm (with the exception of Dorne and the lands beyond the Wall) with three great dragons, Balerion, Vhagar and Meraxes. He was married to both of his sisters, Visenya and Rhaenys.
            Aegon I Targaryen was the first king of the Targaryen dynasty. He was a warlord and Lord of Dragonstone who, with his two sister-wives Visenya and Rhaenys, three great dragons and a small army, invaded and unified six of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros in the War of Conquest; only Dorne managed to successfully resist the Targaryens, using guerilla tactics to resist the dragons until voluntarily joining the Seven Kingdoms with a peaceful marriage alliance.
            Afterwards, Aegon founded the city of King's Landing, began construction on the Red Keep, and forged the Iron Throne from the swords of his defeated enemies, melted with dragonfire. His descendants ruled the Seven Kingdoms for a further three centuries.
            Sansa Stark is given a history lesson by Septa Mordane while visiting the throne room in the Red Keep. Aegon the Conqueror is mentioned as the king who unified the Seven Kingdoms and forged the Iron Throne.[1]
            In Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys Targaryen and Ser Jorah Mormont discuss Aegon's invasion of Westeros and how he unified six of the Seven Kingdoms (the seventh, Dorne, was not added to the realm until some time later) some three hundred years ago. Jorah points out that Aegon had no "right" to the Seven Kingdoms, and never made any legal claim for his conquest: he conquered most of Westeros because he could. Daenerys points out that he could because he had dragons. Jorah expresses doubt that Aegon had dragons, indicating the events happened so long ago it's impossible to be sure.[2]
            While at Harrenhal, Lord Tywin Lannister recounts to Arya Stark the history of the castle. King Harren the Black of the Ironborn wanted to establish a legacy by constructing Harrenhal, the biggest castle ever built on the entire continent. Harrenhal was designed to defend against an attack from the land, and as Tywin muses, "a million men could have marched against its walls, and a million men would have been repelled." However, Harren did not anticipate an attack from the Targaryen dragons, who during the War of Conquest flew right over the high walls and attacked with dragonfire. As Tywin summed it up, "Aegon Targaryen changed the rules." Harren and all of his sons were roasted alive within their own hall by Aegon's dragons, and Harrenhal was left a blasted ruin. However, Arya Stark notes that Aegon was assisted by his sisters in his conquest of Westeros rather than acting alone.
            In the Great Pyramid of Meereen, Tyrion Lannister compares the dragons used by Aegon the Conqueror during his conquest of Westeros to Daenerys's dragons. He makes a point to Varys, Missandei, and Grey Worm about how Daenerys's ancestors after Aegon began locking up their dragons, leading them to shrink in size and eventually go extinct entirely. Tyrion uses this in an attempt to persuade the three to free Daenerys's dragons from their captivity, having been placed there due to Daenerys being unable to control them across Slaver's Bay. Tyrion later unchains the dragons.[3]
            While having a vision of the past, Bran Stark learns that his "half-brother" Jon Snow is actually the son of his aunt Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, Daenerys's brother, making Jon another descendant of Aegon the Conqueror. Around this time, Jon is declared the new King in the North despite his status as a bastard son (but in reality nephew) of the late Eddard Stark. Meanwhile, Daenerys sets sail for Westeros with her armada and dragons with the same intentions as Aegon had: to conquer the Seven Kingdoms.[4]
            When Jon Snow appears before Daenerys Targaryen at Dragonstone, the latter scoffs when Ser Davos Seaworth presents Jon as the King in the North and declares that the last person who held that title was Torrhen Stark, who bent the knee to Aegon in his conquest, apparently not recognizing Robb Stark as the most recent King in the North.[5]
            After Bran Stark reveals to Samwell Tarly at Winterfell that Jon is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark and Samwell tells Bran that the High Septon had Rhaegar's marriage to Elia Martell annulled, Bran uses the sight to look once more into the past at the Tower of Joy, where he witnesses Rhaegar and Lyanna's marriage and Lyanna giving birth to their son, who she tells her brother Ned is named Aegon Targaryen, apparently after Aegon the Conqueror as many Targaryens had been before.[6]
            After the Conquest, Aegon ruled for thirty more years, apparently wisely and well. However, upon his death the realm was plunged into a bloody war when the Faith of the Seven rejected his sons, born of incest, from following him on the throne. Eventually the uprising was put down and the Targaryen rule secured for centuries.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_I_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAegonITargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aegon II Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.12.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aegon II Targaryen was the sixth King of the Targaryen dynasty.
            Aegon II was a King of the Targaryen dynasty. He was the half-brother of Rhaenyra Targaryen.
            During the civil war known as the Dance of Dragons, Aegon fought against Rhaenyra for control of the Iron Throne. She briefly ousted him from King's Landing, but events quickly spiraled out of her control, and half a year later she fled to Dragonstone, where she and her son, who was also named Aegon, were captured by Aegon's supporters. Aegon then had her fed to his dragon, Sunfyre, while forcing his nephew to watch.
            However, Aegon had been severely injured during a dragon-battle earlier in the war and his mind was increasingly gone to milk of the poppy. His unpopularity became so strong that his own men poisoned him just a few months after his sister's execution. After Aegon's death, his daughter was wed to Rhaenyra's son (who became Aegon III) to unite the two warring factions of House Targaryen.
            While touring the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing, King Joffrey Baratheon explains to Margaery Tyrell that Rhaenyra Targaryen was eaten by her brother's dragon while her son was forced to watch.[1]
            At her father's army camp in the North, Princess Shireen Baratheon reads a history book about the civil war between Aegon II and Rhaenyra: The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling by Grand Maester Munkun. When her father Stannis and also Davos Seaworth ask about it, she summarizes that the conflict between Rhaenyra and Aegon II split the Seven Kingdoms in half. Shireen also specifies that Aegon was Rhaenyra's half-brother.[2]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aegon II took the Iron Throne at the behest of his mother, Queen Alicent Hightower, and Lord Commander Criston Cole of the Kingsguard, thereafter known as Criston the Kingmaker, even though his father, Viserys I, intended Rhaenyra, daughter of Viserys' previous consort, to succeed him. Rhaenyra disputed his ascension and claimed the throne for herself, leading to the civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. Aegon managed to defeat his sister, and fed her to his dragon. Shortly thereafter he died himself, leaving no trueborn male heirs, which led to his nephew Aegon III, Rhaenyra's son, taking the throne.
            Queen Alicent had three sons including Aegon II, as well as one daughter. Aegon II's younger brother Aemond rode the dragon Vhagar during the Dance and his youngest brother Daeron rode Tessarion. Following Targaryen custom, Aegon II married his sister Helaena. Aegon II had three trueborn children, twins Jaehaerys and Jaehaera and a younger son Maelor. Aegon II also fathered at least two bastard children, a boy and a girl, with two different mothers. Both Jaehaerys and Maelor died during the civil war, leading Aegon II to be succeeded by his nephew Aegon III. Aegon III solidified the peace between the two rival branches of House Targaryen by marrying Jaehaera. The marriage ultimately proved to be childless, however, and Aegon III later remarried to Daenaera of House Velaryon, with whom he had all of his children. Thus later generations of the Targaryen dynasty apparently possess no descent from Aegon II.
            Later histories often remember Rhaenyra Targaryen as arrogant, because she had been raised as the heir presumptive most of her life. Conversely, this meant that Rhaenyra had been actively trained to rule for many years, and even took part in her father's council meetings. Thus while Rhaenyra may have had a sense of authority and entitlement, it was because she possessed the actual administrative skill to back it up (in much the same sense that while Jaime Lannister was cocky and self-assured about his swordfighting skill, this was because he was officially recognized as one of the best swordsmen in all of Westeros). Aegon II's faction staged the coup against Rhaenyra on the grounds that she was arrogant (if skilled), but it soon became apparent that Aegon II was both arrogant and unskilled at rule. This should have come as little surprise, given that he was still a young man when the Dance broke out, only about twenty two-years old. Histories about the Dance of Dragons repeatedly describe Aegon II as both inexperienced and hot-blooded.
            Aegon II started out as almost a puppet for his mother Queen Alicent Hightower, and at first, he did not even want to seize the throne. His mother only managed to get him to go along with the plan when she convinced him that Rhaenyra would eventually strike first and kill his children, because if his bloodline lasted one of his descendants might eventually challenge one of hers in the future. At the outset, when Rhaenyra first declared war against the coup, Aegon II sent an envoy to her with relatively generous peace terms, offering her the continued rule of Dragonstone if she would submit to him. When she refused, however, something snapped in Aegon II, and he pursued increasingly vicious and ruthless action. As the three years of the war passed he came out from his mother's shadow and began making decisions in his own right - many of which actually hurt his cause.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_II_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAegonIITargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aegon III Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.13.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aegon III Targaryen was the seventh King of the Targaryen dynasty.
            Aegon III was a King of the Targaryen dynasty. He was the son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and her uncle, Prince Daemon Targaryen. He was brother to Viserys.
            Aegon ascended to the Iron Throne following the end of the Dance of the Dragons, after his uncle, King Aegon II, was poisoned by his own courtiers. He was married off to his cousin, Princess Jaehaera Targaryen, to unite the two factions of the war - blacks and greens.[1]
            Eventually, Aegon fathered five children: Daeron, Baelor, Daena, Rhaena and Elaena. After his death, Aegon was succeeded by his elder son Daeron.
            While touring the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing, King Joffrey Baratheon explains to Margaery Tyrell that Rhaenyra Targaryen was eaten by her brother's dragon while her son - Aegon III, whom he doesn't mention by name - was forced to watch.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aegon III watched as his mother was devoured by the dragon of Aegon II, his uncle, during the civil war known as the Dance of Dragons. Due to the trauma of witnessing his mother's death, Aegon III developed a fierce hatred and terror of the creatures.
            Aegon III ascended to the Iron Throne after Aegon II died without any males heirs. He married Aegon II's daughter (and only surviving child) Jaehaera to seal the peace between the two rival branches of House Targaryen. However, she later died without issue, ending Aegon II's line entirely. Aegon III then remarried to Daenaera of House Velaryon, who was the mother of all of his subsequent children.
            Aegon III ascended to the Iron Throne when he was only eleven years old, making him the youngest king in history - until Tommen Baratheon ascended the throne at the age of eight (the TV series aged-up several child characters, so TV-Tommen is actually slightly older than eleven or ten, though even so TV-Tommen came to the throne very young). The early years of his long reign, until he reached the age of majority at sixteen, were a tense period known as the Regency. A regency council was organized with members who fought on both sides in the civil war, a measure taken to ensure peace, given that neither side was truly victorious. Ser Tyland Lannister (who served his grandfather Viserys I as Master of Ships, and later as the Green Master of Coin under Aegon II) became Hand of the King. Tyland served for two years before dying of a winter chill. Lady Jeyne Arryn, ruler of the Vale and one of the core Black leaders, also served on the regency council as well as Lord Corlys Velaryon who died a year later of old age. During the time of the regents, Aegon had little to do with the ruling of the Seven Kingdoms and the regents begun to vie among themselves for more power. Lord Unwin Peake, who served as Hand of the King after Tyland Lannister, was particularly hated for his incesant efforts to marry his daughter to the young king after Queen Jaehaera's suicide (which some believed was murder orchestrated by Lord Peake) but his efforts were rendered futile when Aegon married Daenaera. Lord Peake later resigned the Handship to force the other regents to grant him more power but they surprised him by accepting his resignation.
            The only joy for King Aegon during this time came when his younger brother, Viserys, returned from captivity from Lys with a wife at his side. Viserys had been captured during the Dance of the Dragons by the Lysene and Aegon had always felt guilty for not saving his brother. Viserys would become Aegon's closest friend and the only person he ever truly and fully trusted. When Aegon III reached maturity, he removed the regents from power with the help of his brother and began to rule in his own right. Viserys would later be made his Hand for the rest of his reign.
            Aegon III ruled the Seven Kingdoms long and well, repairing the extensive damage wrought by the civil war. Aegon III is nonetheless often blamed for the death of the last dragon, for which he became known as "Aegon the Dragonbane", despite his later efforts to obtain dragon eggs. At some point he had nine mages cross the sea to attempt to hatch his remaining cache of eggs. So few dragons had survived the civil war that they could not maintain a stable breeding population. Only four dragons had survived the Dance: Silverwing, the Cannibal, Sheepstealer (who was missing and presumed dead), and one other (who only hatched late in the war). The dragons were inbred to begin with, descending only from the original three brought to Westeros by Aegon I and his sisters. The final two dragons were hatched and then died during Aegon III's long reign: they were stunted, sickly creatures not much bigger than large dogs, and they did not live long. Some speculate that the Maesters poisoned the last dragons, because as men of science and learning they feared and hated the magical powers associated with the creatures. It is unknown if this was true, but the maesters certainly had no great love for the dragons and welcomed their demise when it came.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_III_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAegonIIITargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aegon IV Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.14.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aegon IV Targaryen, also called Aegon the Unworthy, was the fourth king of his name to sit on the Iron Throne and the eleventh king of the Targaryen dynasty to rule the Seven Kingdoms. He was formally styled Aegon of House Targaryen, the Fourth of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
            He succeeded his father Viserys II Targaryen and was, in time, succeeded by his son Daeron II. Aegon IV fathered several children, both trueborn and bastard. He was the father of Daeron and Daenerys by his sister-wife, Queen Naerys and with his cousin and mistress, Queen Daena, he fathered Daemon Blackfyre.
            On his deathbed, Aegon IV legitimized all his bastard children, leading Daemon Blackfyre to declare himself the rightful heir to the Iron Throne and igniting another war for the crown.[1][2]
            Aegon IV (along with his vast progeny) is mentioned in the House Targaryen entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms[3]
            Tyrion Lannister mentions that Aegon the Unworthy is one of the kings analyzed in the classic book, Lives of Four Kings.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aegon IV is remembered as one of the worst kings in the entire history of the Targaryen dynasty, which is the reason why he is popularly known as "Aegon the Unworthy". Aegon was a decadent, gluttonous and corrupt ruler, who indulged his passions and whims at every opportunity. Being attractive in his youth, he was popular with women both highborn and lowborn. He had as many as nine mistresses and many bastards. Supposedly, he had any woman he wanted whether they were married or not. People often joked that while the Targaryen words were "Fire and Blood", Aegon IV's motto might as well have been "Wash her and bring her to my bed". Due to his years of overindulgence, by the end of his reign Aegon IV was extremely obese, to the point that his legs could barely support his own weight. Even so, he remained quite vain throughout his life. Moreover, he was a very petty man, needlessly causing strife at the royal court.
            Four of his bastard children were born to noblewomen, and they became known as the "Great Bastards". Chief among them was Daemon, who upon being legitimized created House Blackfyre. Other notable bastards were Aegor Rivers ("Bittersteel"), Brynden Rivers ("Bloodraven") and Shiera Seastar. Aegon IV foolishly legitimized all of his bastard children upon his deathbed, which resulted in Daemon Blackfyre declaring himself the rightful heir and tearing apart the Seven Kingdoms in civil war. Ultimately, Aegon IV's corruption led to a series of Blackfyre Rebellions which would plague Westeros for five generations.
            According to author George R.R. Martin, Aegon IV is loosely the Targaryen equivalent of King Henry VIII of England. Martin's instructions for artistic depictions of Aegon IV explicitly cite Henry VIII. Both kings started out young and attractive, but by the ends of their reigns became infamously fat from overindulgence, and their numerous sexual affairs resulted in bloody succession conflicts which were eventually resolved with the rise of good rulers (Daeron II and Elizabeth I respectively).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_IV_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAegonIVTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aegon V Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.15.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Aegon V Targaryen, also called Aegon the Unlikely, and informally known as Egg, was the fifth king of his name to sit on the Iron Throne and the fifteenth king of the Targaryen dynasty to rule the Seven Kingdoms. He was the father of the Mad King and his sister-wife Queen Rhaella; grandfather of Rhaegar, Viserys, and Daenerys Targaryen; great-grandfather of Jon Snow; and younger brother of Maester Aemon. In the books, he was dubbed "the Unlikely" because he was the fourth son of Maekar Targaryen, who was in turn the fourth son of Daeron II Targaryen, and thus Aegon was highly unlikely to have inherited the crown.
            As the youngest son of King Maekar and Queen Dyanna, Aegon was not originally expected to succeed his father to the throne, but after his older brother Aerion died, and his next older brother Aemon refused the throne due to his vows as a maester, the crown passed to him. Aemon then joined the Night's Watch to remove himself from the royal court, where he might be used as a political tool against his brother.
            Starting as a child, Aegon V began an odd friendship with the hedge knight Ser Duncan the Tall. He became Duncan's squire, and they had many adventures across Westeros. Eventually, after Aegon V came to the throne he named Ser Duncan to the Kingsguard, and in time he became its Lord Commander. He later sent his army to deal with Maelys Blackfyre during the War of the Ninepenny Kings.
            After ruling for many years, Aegon V ultimately died along with Ser Duncan the Tall in the Tragedy at Summerhall when he attempted to hatch new dragon eggs using fire and sorcery. Instead, it caused a fire that spread out of control and destroyed the entire palace. Aegon V died in the conflagration, and was succeeded by his son Aerys II Targaryen.[1]
            At Castle Black, Maester Aemon reveals to Jon Snow that his father was Maekar, and after their father died the crown passed to his brother Aegon, because Aemon refused the throne due to his vows as a maester. He also bitterly recounts how his brother's son, grandson, and great-grandchildren were all slaughtered during Robert's Rebellion, making Snow realize that Aemon is a member of House Targaryen.[2] Unbeknownst to them both, Jon is also descended from Aegon, though Aemon would not live to learn the truth about Jon's parentage.[3][4]
            Aegon V is mentioned in Duncan the Tall's entry in The Book of Brothers.[5]
            On his deathbed, Aemon fondly compares Little Sam to Egg. Later, as his mind begins to slip, he calls out to Egg, and says he had a strange dream that he was an old man.[3]
            Aegon V Targaryen is a major character in George R.R. Martin's Tales of Dunk and Egg prequel novellas, which are set around ninety years before the events of A Song of Ice and Fire.
            Aegon, using the alias "Egg", spent many years traveling the Seven Kingdoms as a squire in the service of Ser Duncan the Tall, a hedge knight. At their first meeting Duncan was unaware of Egg's true identity, until he used his royal authority to save Duncan from being killed by his bullying older brother, Prince Aerion. Duncan was able to instead face Aerion on the tournament field and defeat him in combat. Unfortunately, Prince Baelor "Breakspear" Targaryen, the royal heir, was killed during the tournament. Prince Maekar - Aegon's father - despaired of Aerion's spoiled indolence and agreed to let Aegon serve as Duncan's squire to build character and gain experience of living in the "real" world.
            Aegon ascended to the Iron Throne in 233 AL, following his father Maekar's death in battle with an outlaw lord. Of Aegon's three older brothers, the eldest Daeron (who appears to have been omitted from the show) died of a pox, Aerion had poisoned himself to death (by ill-advisedly drinking wildfire, thinking it might turn him into a dragon), and Aemon had disinherited himself by first joining the maesters and later the Night's Watch. As Aegon V Targaryen, he ruled for twenty-six years. During this time he made Ser Duncan the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and secured an alliance between the Targaryens and House Baratheon by wedding his daughter Rhaelle to the then-Lord of Storm's End, Ormund Baratheon. She later became the grandmother of Robert, Stannis and Renly Baratheon, giving Robert Baratheon his claim to the Iron Throne when he later rebelled against the Targaryens. Aegon V married Betha of House Blackwood and had three sons, Duncan (often called Duncan the Small), Jaehaerys, and Daeron, as well as his two daughters Shaera and Rhaelle.
            Being the fourth son of a fourth son, Aegon V was known as "the Unlikely" because he was unlikely to have inherited the crown. Actually, given that two of his uncles had twin sons, Aegon was initially twelfth in line to the throne when he was born during the reign of his grandfather Daeron II. Even after his father was crowned, he was still fourth in line for many years.
            Aegon V ruled wisely and well, but he had three major weaknesses. The first was that due to his years travelling across Westeros with Ser Duncan, he gained a great concern for the welfare of the Smallfolk, yet opinions about this varied. Commoners remember him as a great king who was genuinely concerned about their well-being, who ensured their economic livelihoods by raising taxes on aristocrats and wealthy merchants, and who punished lords who abused the rights of the commoners they ruled over. The nobility of the Seven Kingdoms, meanwhile, grew to resent Aegon V - for exactly the same reasons.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aegon_V_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascAegonVTargaryen</string></dict>

            Hugh was a Targaryen bastard born on the island of Dragonstone, and due to his heritage, he was one of the Dragonseeds recruited as a dragon-rider for Rhaenyra Targaryen, riding the dragon Vermithor. When the loyalists of Aegon II Targaryen marched from the Reach and besieged Tumbleton, Rhaenyra sent Hugh and Ulf the White to destroy their forces. However, the two chose instead to burn Tumbleton and Rhaenyra's garrisoned troops. Afterwards, they drank and whored with the victorious Aegon loyalists.[1]

            Prince Rhaegel was the third son of King Daeron II Targaryen and Queen Myriah Martell. He was the brother of Baelor "Breakspear", Aerys, Maekar and Aelinor.
            Prince Rhaegel, along with his family, is mentioned in House Targaryen's entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Prince Rhaegel was the third son of King Daeron the Good and Queen Myriah. He was sickly, meek, and insane. He was known for dancing naked through the halls of the Red Keep. He was married to Lady Alys Arryn and had three children, twins Aelor and Aelora, and daughter Daenora.
            He was named Prince of Dragonstone when his brother Aerys I ascended the Iron Throne since Aerys had no children of his own. He later died when he choked on a lamprey pie. His son Aelor became the new Prince of Dragonstone, but he himself died in a mishap at the hands of his sister-wife Aelora. This left her mad with grief and she later took her own life after being assaulted at a masked ball. Daenora was married to her cousin Prince Aerion Targaryen and had a son named Maegor.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaegel_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascRhaegelTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Rhaego</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.18.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rhaego was the son of Khal Drogo and Khaleesi Daenerys Targaryen. He was named in honor of his uncle, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. According to a Dothraki prophecy, he would have been the Stallion Who Mounts the World, a great khal of khals who would have united the Dothraki as one horde and used them to conquer the entire world. He was stillborn after being involved in a blood magic ritual performed by Mirri Maz Duur.
            Daenerys's handmaiden Irri realizes that Daenerys is pregnant with Drogo's child. They throw a small feast to celebrate. Ser Jorah Mormont is troubled by the news and sends word of it to his paymaster, Varys, in King's Landing. Daenerys tells Drogo she is certain the child will be a boy.[1]
            Daenerys strikes her brother Viserys after he threatens her and her unborn son.[2] King Robert Baratheon orders Daenerys, her unborn child and Viserys killed.[3] In Vaes Dothrak, omens are taken and the crones proclaim that Drogo's son will be the Stallion That Mounts the World. Daenerys names him Rhaego for her deceased brother, Rhaegar.[4] Later, during a feast to celebrate, Viserys threatens to kill both Daenerys and Rhaego unless Drogo upholds his end of their bargain, to assist him in reclaiming the Iron Throne. This prompts Drogo to kill Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head. Daenerys and her unborn son are later nearly killed by an assassin sent by Robert Baratheon, although they are saved just in time by Ser Jorah's intervention. Upon learning of the attempt on the life of his wife and unborn son, Drogo declares to invade Westeros and take back the Seven Kingdoms for Rhaego.
            On the borders of Lhazar, close to the Red Waste, a heavily pregnant Daenerys has Mirri Maz Duur perform a blood magic ritual to save Drogo from an infected wound. Whilst the ritual is taking place, Drogo's bloodriders object to the ritual and one of them, Qotho, knocks Daenerys to the ground when she tries to stop him from intervening, causing her to go into premature labour. Desperate to help her, Ser Jorah brings Daenerys into the tent where Mirri is conducting the ritual, despite her orders not to let anyone enter. Rhaego is reportedly stillborn and comes out looking like a monster. Mirri Maz Duur claims that he had scales like a lizard, was blind with bat-like wings, and had innards full of graveworms. She also says that when she touched him, his skin fell away from his bones, and that it was his death that paid for Drogo's life.[5]
            After Pyat Pree tells Daenerys that her stolen dragons are in the possession of the warlocks of Qarth, in the House of the Undying, she goes there to recover them. There, she sees different visions, including one of a Dothraki Khal's tent in a snow storm, north of the Wall. Upon entering, Daenerys finds herself back in her former home while on the Dothraki Sea in Khal Drogo's tent. Before her is her dead husband and child alive again. Rhaego is seen as a small adorable boy in the arms of Drogo. Daenerys shares an emotional moment with them. Drogo says that he doesn't know if this is a dream, but if it is he will kill the man who tries to wake him. Though she longs to stay, Daenerys hears her dragons in the distance and realizes that both Rhaego and Drogo are only an illusion. She turns and walks away, and as she goes the emotion drains from Drogo's eyes.[6]
            During the illusion scene in the House of the Undying in which Daenerys sees a vision of Rhaego had he lived, the character is actually played by a female infant.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, despite being told that her stillborn baby was a monster, Daenerys is visited by images of Rhaego as he would have been had he not been cursed by Mirri Maz Duur and survived. She sees him in her vision in the House of the Undying in Qarth. He appears to her as a young man with his father's physique and tanned skin coloring, with Daenerys' long silver-gold hair, and with almond shaped eyes of the traditional Targaryen purple color. He stands before a burning city, under the banner of a fiery stallion. He holds out his hand to her, but then fire pours from his mouth, and he is consumed by flame.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaego</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascRhaego</string></dict>
        <key>Rhaegar Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.19.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was the eldest son and heir to King Aerys II Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone. He was the older brother of Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen and the husband of Elia Martell, with whom he had two children: Rhaenys and Aegon Targaryen.
            Secretly, however, Rhaegar annulled his marriage with Elia and married Lyanna Stark. Rhaegar's alleged "abduction" of Lyanna sparked Robert's Rebellion, as Lyanna was betrothed to Robert Baratheon. Robert killed Rhaegar at the climactic Battle of the Trident, and then deposed the Targaryen dynasty. Lyanna's brother Eddard Stark found her soon afterwards, as she was dying from childbirth. She was giving birth to her son with Rhaegar. To protect the child from Robert and others who sought the destruction of House Targaryen, Eddard passed him off as his bastard son that he fathered during the war: Jon Snow.[1][2]
            Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was the eldest son and heir of King Aerys II Targaryen, by his sister-wife Queen Rhaella Targaryen.  For three centuries, the Targaryens had continued to incestuously marry brother to sister to keep the bloodline pure in the tradition of their Valyrian ancestors. Over time, this massive inbreeding led to a strain of insanity appearing in the Targaryen bloodline - culminating in Rhaegar's father, Aerys II, who is best remembered as the Mad King.
            Aerys II's reign began with great promise, but as the years passed, he slid deeper and deeper into insanity and paranoia. The shift was gradual and he frequently recovered: by the time it became severe, Prince Rhaegar already showed such great promise as the future heir to the throne that most were willing to simply put up with Aerys's eccentricities, to wait out the remainder of his reign until Rhaegar succeeded him.  Rhaegar was brave, kind, and wise and most looked forward to the golden era that would assuredly begin when he took the throne. Greatly troubled by Aerys II's growing insanity, Rhaegar was torn between whether to act against him or not, but could not bring himself to turn against his own father.  Like the rest of the realm, Rhaegar hoped to simply wait out the rest of his father's reign, and that his bouts of insanity would remain manageable by his courtiers.[3]
            Rhaegar had good reason to think that the Small Council could keep the realm together despite his father's madness, as it was very capably led by Tywin Lannister, who served as Aerys's Hand of the King for nearly twenty years.  Tywin was not only able to keep Aerys from tearing the realm apart, but managed royal affairs so well that he brought two decades of peace and plenty for Westeros, to the point that most people throughout the realm were unaware of the king's madness until the final years of his reign.
            Because Aerys and his sister-wife had produced no daughters for Rhaegar to wed, he had to look outside the family for a bride. Many assumed that in reward for Tywin's long and distinguished service as Aerys's chief advisor, the bond between the Targaryens and Lannisters would eventually be solidified with a marriage-alliance between Prince Rhaegar and Tywin's daughter Cersei (particularly, Cersei herself, who for a time was quite infatuated with the Crown Prince).[4] Yet Aerys surprisingly spurned the match, saying that Tywin was still just a servant and shouldn't try to elevate his family above its station, as such a match was beneath Rhaegar. It was later believed that Aerys did this in a fit of paranoia that Tywin was trying to usurp him.  Despite everything Tywin had done for him in two decades of loyal service, Aerys had grown resentful and fearful that many people throughout the realm whispered - accurately - that Tywin was the real power behind the throne by that point. Alienating his greatest ally Tywin, Aerys instead agreed to an arranged marriage between Rhaegar and Elia Martell, a princess of Dorne, daughter of the ruling Princess of Dorne (who was a distant cousin of the royal line through intermarriage a century before). Rhaegar and Elia's marriage was happy according to all accounts. Oberyn Martell, Elia's younger brother, says that his sister loved her husband. Rhaegar and Elia had two children: first a daughter named Rhaenys, and then a son named Aegon.[5][6][7]
            A few years later, the great Tourney of Harrenhal was held, where all the prominent lords of Westeros assembled. During the feast, Rhaegar played a song on his harp so beautiful and sorrowful that it moved even the wild she-wolf Lyanna Stark to tears. The exact events that happened in private are unknown, but the public events at the tourney's final joust are known to all: Rhaegar faced off against Ser Barristan Selmy in the final tilt, and won.  Instead of then giving the victor's wreath to his own wife Elia Martell, however, the entire crowd of hundreds of people fell silent as he rode past her and gave it to Lyanna Stark, to name her as the tournament's Queen of Love and Beauty. This was doubly controversial, as Lyanna was herself already betrothed to Robert Baratheon.  At the same tourney, King Aerys announced that he was naming young Jaime Lannister to the Kingsguard. While he was a very skilled swordsman, Aerys really appointed Jaime to the order to rob Tywin of his eldest son and heir (as the Kingsguard foreswear all right to inheritance), and treat him as a glorified political hostage at the royal court, should Tywin ever turn against him. Tywin was infuriated, as he had been grooming Jaime for years to succeed him as ruler of House Lannister, and by law, Jaime's removal meant that the next in line to inherit Casterly Rock would be Tywin's hated dwarf son Tyrion. Tywin promptly resigned as Hand of the King, and withdrew from King's Landing back to Casterly Rock.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaegar_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascRhaegarTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Mossador</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.20.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mossador was a former slave from Meereen.
            Mossador attempts to convince his fellow slaves to join Daenerys Targaryen and defeat the Great Masters, though he meets resistance from skeptical older slaves who have lived through failed slave rebellions. After Grey Worm motivates them even further than Mossador and provides them with weapons, they launch a revolt against the Masters.[1]
            Mossador, now representing Meereen's freedmen in Daenerys's small council, reports to Daenerys Targaryen along with Grey Worm that White Rat, one of the Unsullied, was found with his throat slit at a brothel, murdered by the Sons of the Harpy.[2]
            Mossador is present when the council debates what should be done with a captured Harpy's Son. When the queen decides to give the prisoner a fair trial, Mossador interprets Daenerys's decision on the matter to mean that her hands are tied, and without permission, kills the captive. Daenerys has him brought out in chains before a crowd for execution, as a warning to everyone, freed slave or Great Master, not to pervert the course of justice. He pleads for forgiveness but she has Daario cut off his head, causing a riot.[3]
            The character was originally credited as "slave" in Season 4. Season 5 casting news revealed the character's name as "Keyr", but on March 21st it was revealed the character's name was changed to "Mossador".[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mossador is the name of one of the three brothers of Missandei who were enslaved alongside her and made into Unsullied and one of two who survived the training. After being liberated by Daenerys, Mossador is one of the Unsullied who reclaims his birth name. While patrolling the streets of Meereen at night, Mossador and another of the Unsullied were ambushed by the Sons of the Harpy. They were crushed to death by falling stones beneath the river wall.
            "Mossador" in the TV series is not Missandei's brother: the TV writers just re-used a name from the novels for a separate character. While he has no direct counterpart in the novels, TV-Mossador is a condensation of several former slave characters in Meereen who don't want peace with the former slave masters.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mossador</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascMossador</string></dict>

            Malakho is an aged Dothraki in Khal Drogo's khalasar. After Ko Pono and Ko Jhaqo abandoned the khalasar following Drogo's incapacitation and death, Malakho remained. After Daenerys' hatched her three dragon eggs, Malakho pledged loyalty to the khaleesi.
            Malakho can be seen in the background when Daenerys' silver horse dies of exhaustion in the Red Waste,[1] and when the the Thirteen receive Daenerys at the gates of Qarth.[2] Malakho attends the reception for Daenerys in the home of Xaro Xhoan Daxos. He and Kovarro have to be prevented from stealing Xaro's statuary.[3] He guards Daenerys during her return from a meeting with the Spice King and is present when she discovers the theft of her dragons.[4] He guards Daenerys's room after the theft.[5]
            After the duplicity of Xaro Xhoan Daxos is discovered, Malakho is the one who forces the would-be King of Qarth into his empty vault.[6]
            Malakho is a new character created for the TV series who does not appear in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels. It is mentioned that of the few Dothraki who stay with Daenerys after Drogo dies, most are old men or green boys.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Malakho</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascMalakho</string></dict>

            Maelor was the youngest child of Aegon II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Helaena Targaryen. He presumably had a very close relationship with his mother. When his cousin Lucerys Velaryon was killed by Maelor's uncle Aemond Targaryen, Lucerys's stepfather Daemon Targaryen hired two assassinates to kill Aegon's and Helaena's children. One was a former Goldcloak known as Blood and the other was a rat-catcher known as Cheese who knew all the sewers around King's Landing. This meant that they both had perfect recognition of the layout of the Red Keep. After breaking into the royal apartments, they found Helaena putting her children to bed. They demanded a son for a son. Helaena pleaded that they kill her instead, but they refused. She named Maelor as the victim. However, Cheese just told Maelor that his mother wanted him dead, and some believe that Helaena named Maelor because Jaehaerys was heir to the Iron Throne, or because Maelor was just too young to understand. This request became an act of defiance against the Greens, as Blood just beheaded Jaehaerys with a single blow. By the time the guards had came, the Queen was cradling her son's body. Jaehaerys's death would eventually led to his mother's insanity and suicide. He presumably died some time before his father, as his cousin Aegon III Targaryen suceeded his father as King.[1]
            
            Maelor was born in 127 AC, the third child of his parents, Prince Aegon and Princess Helaena Targaryen. In 129 AC, on the third day of the third moon, Maelor, his two elder siblings, and his mother, went to visit their grandfather, King Viserys I Targaryen. While Viserys told Maelor's siblings a story, Maelor himself was given a pearl ring from Viserys's finger to play with.
            After King Viserys I died in King's Landing, Maelor's father, Prince Aegon, was crowned as King Aegon II Targaryen, despite Aegon's older sister Princess Rhaenyra having been the King's proclaimed heir. This caused a war known as the Dance of the Dragons.
            With his father now king, the two-year-old prince became second in line to the Iron Throne. Later that year, Maelor's elder brother, Prince Jaehaerys, was murdered. The assassins Blood and Cheese had snuck into the Tower of the Hand, where Queen Helaena would visit her mother's chambers every night with Maelor, Jaehaerys, and Jaehaera. Once Helaena and the children had arrived, they locked the doors and killed the guards, and forced Helaena to choose which of her sons would die. Helaena, after having offered herself, eventually picked Maelor. The two killers chose Prince Jaehaerys anyway, and cut off his head. This left young Maelor with the knowledge that his mother had been willing to sacrifice him. With Prince Jaehaerys dead, Maelor became King Aegon II's heir and the de facto Prince of Dragonstone.
            During the fall of King's Landing, the Master of Whisperers, Lord Larys the Clubfoot, smuggled Maelor and his sister Jaehaera to safety, charging Ser Rickard Thorne of the Kingsguard to bring Maelor to Oldtown. At Bitterbridge Rickard was brought down by a mob, and Maelor was torn apart as the people of the mob each sought to claim him as their own prize.

        <key>Maekar Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.23.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Maekar I Targaryen, full name Maekar of House Targaryen, the First of His Name, was the fourteenth King in the Targaryen dynasty. Maekar's personal sigil was the normal Targaryen sigil, quartered, so that it repeated four times.[1]
            Maekar was the fourth son and fifth child of King Daeron II Targaryen and Queen Myriah Martell. His siblings were Baelor, Aerys I, Aelinor, and Rhaegel.
            He wed Dyanna of House Dayne with whom he had three sons: Aerion, who ultimately killed himself by drinking wildfire; Aemon, who would become a Maester at Castle Black and a member of the Night's Watch; and Aegon V Targaryen, who would succeed him to the Iron Throne.[2]
            Although he was the fourth son, a rather grim chain of events ultimately led to his ascension to the Iron Throne. First, he accidentally killed his oldest brother Baelor in the Trial by Seven of Duncan the Tall, which was ironically provoked by his eldest son Aerion.[3][1] This led to the ascension of the second son, Aerys I, who died without issue. The third son, Rhaegel, either predeceased both Aerys and Maekar or was skipped over because he had succumbed to the "Targaryen madness" that has afflicted many members of House Targaryen due to multiple generations of compound inbreeding, hence the throne passed to Maekar instead.
            When revealing his true identity and origins to Jon Snow, Maester Aemon mentions the name of his father.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Maekar Targaryen is the fourteenth Targaryen to sit the Iron Throne. He was the fourth son of King Daeron II and Myriah Martell. As the son of Daeron II, he was also the grandson of King Aegon IV Targaryen. Maekar was given the Targaryen seat of Summerhall, and was a capable army commander who served in the Blackfyre Rebellion. After a number of unexpected deaths in the royal family, he came to the throne in 221AL. He ruled until 233AL, when he fell in battle against a rebel lord.
            He was the father of Daeron, Aerion, Aemon, Aegon, Rhae and Daella.
            Maekar appears as a major character in the Tales of Dunk and Egg prequel novellas.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Maekar_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascMaekarTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Maegor Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.24.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Maegor Targaryen, formally known as Maegor of House Targaryen, the First of His Name - and infamously dubbed Maegor the Cruel - was the third King of the Andals and the First Men during the Targaryen dynasty.
            King Aegon the Conqueror had two children by his two sister-wives: his firstborn son Aenys with his sister Queen Rhaenys, and his second-born son Maegor with his sister Queen Visenya Targaryen. When Aegon I eventually died, Aenys succeeded him as the second king on the Iron Throne.
            The Targaryens had incestuously married brother to sister for generations (whenever possible) to "keep the bloodline pure", in the custom of their Valyrian ancestors. For that matter, Aegon I broke not only the Faith's rules against incest, but its rules against polygamy, as he was married to both of his sisters at the same time.
            To the surprise of all, however, later in his reign King Aenys tactlessly wed his daughter to his own son: the incestuous marriage of Princess Rhaena and Prince Aegon broke the Targaryens' prior promise to the Faith, which could stand the abomination no longer. The new High Septon led the denunciation of the Targaryens, and the military order of the Faith of the Seven, the Faith Militant, rose up in open revolt.[1]
            Aenys was then succeeded by his younger half-brother Maegor, Aegon I's only child by Visenya - seizing power ahead of Aenys's own children. Maegor was his brother's exact opposite: a highly skilled warrior and brutal tyrant, quickly earning him the name "Maegor the Cruel".[1]
            King Maegor struck back against the Faith Militant. When he arrived in King's Landing his first act was to challenge their leaders to kill him in personal combat, if they believed his rule to be ungodly. The Faith accepted, and Ser Damon Morrigen proposed they hold a trial of seven - the more dangerous but theoretically more holy variant of a traditional trial by combat in which two teams of seven men fight each other. Many tales are told of their confrontation, Ser Damon and six of the Faith Militant against Maegor and members of his Kingsguard - but all the stories agree that at the end, out of all fourteen men only Maegor himself remained alive, proving that the throne was rightfully his.
            Maegor now demanded the complete destruction of the Faith Militant, and made war upon the order wherever he found it. Yet the Faith Militant would not surrender, raising its own armies across the realm, and turning some of Maegor's own lords against him. Many battles were fought as the Faith Militant uprising dragged on for years, lasting throughout all of Maegor's reign.[1]
            Maegor finished constructing the Red Keep during his reign, including the formidable central fortification which was named "Maegor's Holdfast" after him.[2][3] After the construction was finished, Maegor had all the workers and masons killed, reportedly in order that only he would know all of the secret tunnels he had them build hidden throughout the castle.[4]
            Eventually, Maegor's reign of terror came to an end when he died upon the Iron Throne itself. Maegor's cruelty died with him, however, as he was succeeded by Aenys's remaining son, who became King Jaehaerys I. A wise and benevolent ruler, Jaehaerys I made peace with the Faith in return for disbanding the Faith Militant, ending the uprisings. Jaehaerys's subsequent long reign did much to mend the wounds to the realm caused by Maegor.[1]
            While visiting the Great Hall of the Red Keep, Septa Mordane quizzes Sansa Stark on her history lessons, and asks her who built the structure and the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly responds that Aegon the Conqueror made the Iron Throne, and "Maegor the Cruel" built the Red Keep.[2]
            Wisdom Hallyne mentions that Maegor was a great patron of the Alchemists' Guild and their work producing wildfire, which he used against his enemies.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Maegor was the second son of Aegon I Targaryen. His mother was Aegon's elder sister-wife Visenya Targaryen. He was the third king of the Targaryen dynasty - usurping the throne ahead of his half-brother Aenys's children - and is infamously remembered as a brutal tyrant.
            Aegon I kept a mobile royal court, making royal progresses around his new realm to bind it together, and while the Red Keep was still under construction. Aegon kept Aenys with him as his heir, while Maegor was raised back at the ancestral Targaryen castle on Dragonstone. In time Maegor was commonly referred to as "the Prince of Dragonstone" - though at the time this was just a nickname, it became a by-word for his status as Aenys's presumed heir.
            Maegor was a preternaturally skilled swordsman (not unlike the later Jaime Lannister), at the age of barely 12 he easily defeated squires five years older than himself. He was one of the youngest men ever knighted, at only 16 years old. In contrast, Aenys was physically frail and no great warrior, better suited to the comforts of court life and a patron of the arts. While Aenys wore fine silks at court, during his own reign Maegor most commonly wore armor, because he was constantly on military campaigns.
            When the two brothers were young, Aenys bonded with the dragon Quicksilver, one of the progeny of Aegon I's original three dragons. Maegor, however, refused to bond with any of the other half-dozen dragon hatchlings at the time, claiming none were worthy. Apparently, Maegor was holding out for his father's own mount, Balerion the Black Dread himself, the greatest living dragon - after Aegon I died of a stroke in his old age, Maegor successfully bonded with the great beast, and used him to devastating effect in crushing those who rebelled against the Iron Throne.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Maegor_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascMaegorTargaryen</string></dict>

            Lord Lyman was a member of the Small Council under Viserys I Targaryen.

            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lyman Beesbury is never mentioned. He appears, however, in The Princess and the Queen short story. Lord Lyman was Lord of Honeyholt and the Master of Coin during the reign of Jaehaerys the Conciliator and also under Viserys I, as replacement of Prince Daemon Targaryen. He was eighty when Viserys I passed away. When the small council met to plot crowning Prince Aegon, Viserys's eldest son by his second wife, over Princess Rhaenyra, Viserys's designated heir, Lord Lyman soundly protested even though he was outnumbered.

        <key>Qhono</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.26.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Qhono is a Dothraki warrior.
            Qhono is among the Dothraki horde escorting a captive Daenerys Targaryen along with Akho, leading her to their master Khal Moro. Along the way, the two Dothraki taunt and mock their prisoner. Later, he is present along with two bloodriders plus Moro's wives as the Khal contemplates raping Daenerys prior to her revealing her true identity as Khal Drogo's widow.[1]
            After the khalasar's arrival in Vaes Dothrak, he personally escorts Daenerys to the Dosh khaleen.[2]
            During the Khalar vezhven determining their charge's fate, Qhono was in the city during the talks when the temple was set ablaze by Daenerys, killing his khal plus nine others in addition to the other bloodriders. He watched on in horror as the wood-and-thatch building burned to the ground, knowing he couldn't do anything about it. After he saw Daenerys emerge completely unscathed, Qhono joined the rest of Vaes Dothrak's denizens in bowing down to their new Khaleesi.[3]
            Qhono successfully crossed the Narrow Sea with the rest of Daenerys's Dothraki. He is the senior bloodrider present when Jon Snow and Davos Seaworth arrive on Dragonstone. At Missandei's prompting, Qhono confiscates their visitors' weapons and leads the way to Daenerys's throne room. When Jon moves too close to his khaleesi, Qhono moves into a defensive position as a warning. When Daenerys cuts the meeting short, she gives a long list of orders to Qhono, presumably regarding how Jon and Ser Davos are to be treated.[4]
            Qhono is one of the guards that protect Tyrion Lannister as he watches on the Battle of the Goldroad. Qhono tells the Lord Hand that his people do not fight well against the Dothraki while Tyrion, who is visibly disturbed by watching his people get cut down, continues to watch on.[5] After their return to Dragonstone, Qhono escorts Ser Jorah Mormont to Daenerys, when he claimed to be a friend of hers. Later, he was present when Jon Snow and a group of allies departed Dragonstone for Eastwatch, hoping to capture a wight beyond the wall.
            Qhono is on hand during the Parley in King's Landing, acting as a guard of Daenerys's contingent.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, no Dothraki named "Qhono" has been mentioned in the storyline as of the fifth novel, A Dance with Dragons. However, the storyline in which Qhono is involved in the show will not appear in the books until the sixth book in the series, The Winds of Winter, which has not been released yet, so he could appear in that book.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Qhono</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascQhono</string></dict>
        <key>Duncan the Tall</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.27.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Duncan the Tall is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is long deceased when the events of the series begin. Duncan the Tall is a legendary knight and the subject of several popular songs and stories.
            Ser Duncan the Tall was a great knight in the history of Westeros, a famous warrior and a great friend to King Aegon V Targaryen. He lived roughly between 40 and 105 years before the events of the series, and was Lord Commander of the Kingsguard when Ser Barristan Selmy started his rise to prominence. He is immortalized in many songs and stories.
            His personal sigil, seen in his entry in the The Book of Brothers, was a shooting star over an elm tree proper, on a sunset orange background.[1]
            His adventures began during the tourney at Ashford, which led to him fighting in a trial by combat against Prince Aerion "Brightflame" Targaryen. Aerion demanded a rare trial by seven - a seven man team led by Duncan against a seven man team led by Aerion, considered very dangerous, but Duncan won the day. This indirectly led to the death of the Prince of Dragonstone, Baelor "Breakspear" Targaryen, from a concussion dealt by an accidental blow from his own brother Prince Maekar Targaryen, who was also Aerion's father, during the Trial by Seven of Duncan the Tall. At the end of the incident, the grieved Maekar agreed to let his youngest son, Prince Aegon (commonly called "Egg") become Duncan's squire, and join him in his journeys across Westeros.
            Old Nan asks Bran Stark if he wants to hear a story and proposes one about Ser Duncan the Tall, saying those were always his favorites, but Bran wants a scary story.[2]
            Shortly before his wedding, King Joffrey Baratheon finds Ser Duncan's entry when looking through The Book of Brothers. Joffrey is surprised that Ser Duncan had four whole pages devoted to his exploits, much more than is usual, and says that he must have been quite a man. Jaime Lannister agrees that everyone says he was.[1]
            Ser Duncan the Tall and his unusual friendship with King Aegon V Targaryen are the subjects of the Tales of Dunk and Egg, a series of novellas written by George R.R. Martin set roughly ninety years before the events of the main books. These stories are The Hedge Knight, The Sworn Sword, and The Mystery Knight, the first two of which have been reprinted as graphic novels. A fourth short story, The She-Wolves of Winterfell, was intended to be published in 2012, but was postponed until an unknown date.
            In these stories, Duncan is revealed to be an orphan boy from the poor quarter of King's Landing, the area known as Flea Bottom. He attracted the attention of a hedge knight called Ser Arlan of Pennytree, and squired for the old man, accompanying him to many tournaments and on at least one major campaign, an incursion into the Red Mountains of Dorne led by House Dondarrion to root out a bandit king. Ser Arlan died on his way to a great tournament at Ashford. Taking up his sword, armor and horses, Dunk competed in the tourney as a knight and was joined by a young boy called "Egg", who asked to become his squire, though Egg was later revealed to be the young Aegon Targaryen in disguise.[3]
            As his nickname attests, Ser Duncan was very tall, standing nearly seven feet in height as an adult. This puts him around the same height as Greatjon Umber, though not quite as tall as Hodor (who is in fact several inches over seven feet tall), but taller than Brienne of Tarth (who stands about six foot three inches).
            His original name was actually "Dunk" - or rather, growing up as a street urchin in Flea Bottom with no knowledge of his parents or origins, that is the name he picked up as a small child and continued to use until Ser Arlan died (he doesn't remember how he got the name). When he entered himself into the tourney at Ashford as a knight, he was asked if "Dunk" was short for "Duncan", and he decided to say it was, because it was more formal and thus sounded like a better name for a knight (and for all he knew, maybe "Dunk" was short for "Duncan", given that he didn't know how he got his name).
            It is strongly implied, but never outright stated, that Ser Arlan didn't actually knight Dunk before he died, but because the tourney at Ashford was strictly only letting knights enter, Dunk decided to lie and say that Ser Arlan had knighted him before his death. Any single knight can dub another man a knight, however, so for all anyone knew Ser Arlan actually did knight Dunk while they were alone on the road - squires are usually promised to eventually be knighted by the men they serve. Dunk was Ser Arlan's squire for years, and earnestly wanted to be a chivalrous knight, and Ser Arlan may have even promised to knight him at some point in the future, but then he died very suddenly from a chill while on the road to Ashford, before he got the chance. The matter is ultimately ambiguous.
            Somewhat like the later Sansa Stark or Brienne of Tarth, Dunk became utterly enamored with Ser Arlan's teachings about the duty of a true knight to be chivalrous and defend the weak, and has a very idealized, almost Don Quixote - like belief in what knighthood is. While this strikes many experienced knights as naive, many commoners he encounters - used to being abused by greedy and selfish knights - come to admire his simple but honest belief in the vows of a knight to always do what is right and defend the innocent. During the tourney at Ashford itself, Duncan became smitten with a beautiful and tall Dornish woman named Tanselle, but when she was assaulted by the sadistic Prince Aerion Targaryen (for the flippant reason that she showed a dragon dying in her puppet show), Duncan walked up and defended her, punching Aerion so hard he knocked loose one of his teeth. Many cynically felt that striking a prince of the royal blood like this was suicidal and utterly naive - but others, including Aeron's own uncle Prince Baelor, were moved by how Duncan lived up to a knight's vow to always protect women from harm, and how he shamed all of the other wealthier knights who were ignoring Aerion's abuse.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Duncan_the_Tall</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascDuncantheTall</string></dict>

            Duncan was the eldest son and heir of King Aegon V Targaryen. He was named in honor of his father's great friend Ser Duncan the Tall, who had also become Lord Commander of Aegon V's Kingsguard. He died alongside his father and his namesake in the Tragedy at Summerhall.[1]
            He is mentioned in his namesake's entry in The Book of Brothers.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Duncan was the eldest son of King Aegon V Targaryen, named after his close friend Ser Duncan the Tall. He once defeated the ten-year-old Barristan Selmy in a tourney at Blackhaven. Prince Duncan took pity on the small knight and jousted against him when no one else would, giving Barristan the nickname "the Bold". Years later he was defeated by Ser Barristan at a winter tourney in King's Landing.
            Prince Duncan fell in love with a woman known as Jenny of Oldstones and loved her so much he gave up his crown for her and married her against his father's wishes. His love for her inspired a song. He died in the Tragedy at Summerhall alongside his father and his namesake.
            Due to the simplification of the Targaryen lineage by removing Jaehaerys II from the line of kings and making Aerys and Rhaella the children of Aegon V rather than his grandchildren, Duncan is Aerys and Rhaella's brother in the TV series though he was their uncle in the books.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Duncan_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascDuncanTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Jaehaerys I Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.29.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Jaehaerys I Targaryen was the fourth king of the Targaryen Dynasty.
            Jaehaerys I was the fourth king of the Targaryen dynasty, and reigned two centuries before the War of the Five Kings. He was a son of King Aenys Targaryen.
            Aenys died at the beginning of the Faith Militant uprising, after which the throne was usurped by his half-brother Maegor the Cruel, ahead of Aenys's own children.[1]
            Following the death of King Maegor the Cruel, Jaehaerys ascended to the Iron Throne and dispatched his Hand of the King, Septon Barth, who made peace with the Faith of the Seven, putting an end to the conflict with the Faith of the Seven. In exchange for the Iron Throne swearing to always defend and protect the Faith, the Faith Militant would disarm and disband and the Faith would give up its condemnation of the incestuous practices of House Targaryen.[1]
            Jaehaerys was wed to his own sister, Queen Alysanne Targaryen.[2]
            Trying to make his way back south of the Wall, Samwell Tarly explains to Gilly that there is a secret passage at the Nightfort, the first castle on the Wall, and that the castle was abandoned during the reign of King Jaehaerys the First.[3]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jaehaerys I is fondly remembered as one of the best kings the Targaryen dynasty ever produced, and his long reign became synonymous with peace and prosperity. He was the longest-ruling king in history, sitting on the Iron Throne for fifty-five years, and due to his advanced age by the end of his reign is often called "the Old King". He is also known as "Jaehaerys the Conciliator" because he brought an end to the eleven year uprising by the Faith of the Seven which had been fought by his uncle Maegor the Cruel. Jaehaerys offered the Faith generous terms of amnesty, so long as they acknowledged Targaryen rule and disbanded the military orders of the religion, known as the Faith Militant. Jaehaerys I was also the first king to establish a unified system of laws across the entire realm (even Aegon the Conqueror had not tampered with the local laws of each kingdom, fearing this would unnecessarily antagonize his new subjects).
            Jaehaerys I was a dragon-rider: his mount was Vermithor, one of the second-generation progeny of the original three Targaryen dragons, and in later years the largest living dragon after the first-generation Balerion and Vhagar.
            Jaehaerys I was the son of Aegon I's older son, Aenys I, a weakling who did not easily hold onto the throne. The Targaryens' incestuous marriage practices caused friction with the Faith of the Seven, but Aenys had no sisters so he married Alyssa of House Velaryon - a Valyrian family who had followed their Targaryen liege-lords by settling on the islands in Blackwater Bay. Eventually, Aenys made the foolish decision to announce that his eldest son Prince Aegon would marry his own daughter Rhaena - continuing the Targaryens' incestuous practices like this infuriated the leadership of the Faith, sparking off the Faith Militant uprising.
            Aenys fled to Dragonstone, where he became catatonic and died (some suspect he was poisoned), after which Maegor seized the throne ahead of Aenys's children. Few contested Maegor at first, because unlike Aenys, he effectively hammered the Faith Militant. After Aenys's death, Jaehaerys, his mother Alyssa, and his sister Alysanne were held as hostages on Dragonstone to prevent Prince Aegon, Aenys's eldest son and rightful heir, from trying to take the throne. Jaehaerys's older brother Viserys was also held captive but in King's Landing as the king's squire. Prince Aegon launched his own revolt against Maegor in 43 AC, riding his own father's dragon Quicksilver, but was killed by Maegor riding Balerion at the great Battle Beneath the God's Eye. After the death of Dowager Queen Visenya on Dragonstone in 44 AC, Alyssa, Jaehaerys and Alysanne escaped from Dragonstone. Viserys was killed as retaliation for their escape. With Aegon and Viserys dead, this left Jaehaerys as Aenys's last male heir.
            As Maegor's reign of terror progressed, even his closest allies abandoned him. Supported by his mother and Robar Baratheon, the Lord of Storm's End, Jaehaerys put forth his own claim to the throne. Hundreds of lords rallied to young Jaehaerys. Maegor had so few supporters left in the end that there was no final battle - completely abandoned, as rebel armies loyal to Jaehaerys approached, he died on the Iron Throne itself - most likely, realizing all hope was lost, he opened his own wrists on the blades of the throne rather than face capture. Jaehaerys became the new king though he was still a minor. His mother became regent until he came of age two years after Maegor's death, and was supported by Robar Baratheon (grandson of Orys), who had been appointed Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
            Following Targaryen custom, Jaehaerys married his own sister Alysanne. She was actively involved in court affairs and became one of Jaehaerys's chief counselors, if not practical co-ruler. Alysanne also rode her own dragon, named Silverwing. She is also fondly remembered in the Seven Kingdoms, as "Good Queen Alysanne". Jaehaerys's best friend was Septon Barth, a lowborn man in charge of the library at the Red Keep whom he named as Hand of the King; Barth was also one of the best Hands in history, and he played a role in all of Jaehaerys's great works for four decades.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jaehaerys_I_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascJaehaerysITargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Jaehaerys Targaryen </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.30.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Prince Jaehaerys Targaryen was a Prince of the Targaryen dynasty.
            Jaehaerys was the eldest son of Aegon II Targaryen and his sister-wife Helaena Targaryen. He presumably had a very close relationship with his mother. When his cousin Lucerys Velaryon was killed by Jaehaerys's uncle Aemond Targaryen, Lucerys's stepfather/great-uncle Daemon Targaryen, who was also Jaehaerys's great-uncle, hired two assassins to kill Aegon's and Helaena's children. One was a former Goldcloak known as Blood and the other was a rat-catcher known as Cheese who knew all the sewers around King's Landing. This meant that they both had perfect recognition of the layout of the Red Keep. After breaking into the royal apartments, they found Helaena putting her children to bed. They demanded a son for a son. Helaena pleaded they kill her instead, but they refused. She named Jaehaerys's younger brother Maelor as the victim. However, Cheese just told Maelor that his mother wanted him dead, and some believe that Helaena named Maelor because Jaehaerys was heir to the Iron Throne, or because Maelor was just too young to understand. This request became an act of defiance against the Greens, as Blood just beheaded Jaehaerys with a single blow. By the time the guards came, the Queen was cradling her son's body. Jaehaerys's death would eventually led to his mother's insanity and suicide.[1]
            
            Prince Jaehaerys was born in the year 123 AC, barely a year after his parents had wed. The greens at the court of King Viserys I Targaryen were happy to proclaim that Prince Aegon Targaryen now had heirs of his own. A dragon egg was placed in Jaehaerys's cradle, and as well one in the cradle of Jaehaerys's twin sister, Jaehaera. Both eggs soon hatched, and for Jaehaerys, the dragon Shrykos was born.
            That same year, two of Jaehaerys's half-siblings were born: a boy, whose mother was a whore on the Street of Silk, and a girl, whose mother was a maidservant of Jaehaerys's grandmother, Alicent Hightower. In 127 AC, Jaehaerys's trueborn brother, Maelor, was born.
            In 129 AC, on the third day of the third moon, Jaehaerys, his sister Jaehaera, his brother Maelor, and their mother, Princess Helaena Targaryen, went to visit their grandfather, King Viserys I Targaryen. There, Jaehaerys listened to the story Viserys told, about their great-great-grandsire, King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, Jaehaerys's namesake, and how he had flown north of the Wall on his dragon to fight against wildlings, giants, and wargs. After the story was told, Jaehaerys, his siblings, and his mother, left, as the King was tired.
            At the death of King Viserys I Targaryen, Jaehaerys and his twin sister were six years old. With Aegon II Targaryen crowned King, Jaehaerys became the heir to the throne.[1]
            Jaehaerys's uncle killed the second son of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, Lucerys Velaryon. Prince Daemon Targaryen, upon learning about this, declared vengeance, writing that there would be “(a)n eye for an eye, a son for a son.”
            Sometime thereafter, two men, remembered in history only as Blood and Cheese, snuck into the chambers of Dowager Queen Alicent Hightower, which were located in the Tower of the Hand. As was her custom, Queen Helaena Targaryen took her three children to visit their grandmother at dusk, before they went to bed. Once Queen Helaena entered the chambers with Jaehaerys, Jaehaera, and Maelor, Blood barred the door and slew the Helaena's guardsman whilst Cheese appeared and snatched up Maelor. Cheese told Helaena that they were two "debt collectors". They told the queen “an eye for an eye, a son for a son” and asked her which one of her sons she wanted killed. The queen offered herself but the two killers refused, telling her that it had to be a son, a boy.
            On her knees weeping, Helaena eventually named her youngest child, two-year-old Maelor, to be killed. Upon those words, Blood gave a grin and slew Prince Jaehaerys instead, striking off the boy's head with a single blow from his sword. The two men did no further harm to either Jaehaera or Maelor, and only fled with Jaehaerys's head in hand.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jaehaerys_Targaryen_(son_of_Aegon_II)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascJaehaerysTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Daeron I Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.31.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Daeron I Targaryen, also called the Young Dragon, was the first King of his name to sit on the Iron Throne and the eighth king of the Targaryen dynasty to rule the Seven Kingdoms. He was formally styled Daeron of House Targaryen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
            Daeron I lived about a century and a half before the War of the Five Kings. He succeeded his father Aegon III to the throne. Daeron I is best known for his military campaign in Dorne, which had stubbornly resisted prior invasions by the Targaryens. In the process, Daeron lost 60,000 men, and ultimately his own life.[1][2] Having fathered no heir, he was succeeded by his younger brother, Baelor Targaryen, called "Baelor the Blessed".
            
            Tyrion Lannister mentions that Daeron I, the Young Dragon, is one of the kings analyzed in the classic book, Lives of Four Kings.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daeron I became king when he was only 14 years old, but quickly proved himself one of the finest warriors and generals in the history of Westeros. Later history and popular culture remember him as the paragon "young warrior king". Both Robb Stark and Jon Snow idolized him growing up. George R.R. Martin has described him as essentially the Alexander the Great of Westeros, in the sense that he was a young, preternaturally skilled genius at military tactics.
            While the Targaryens had conquered and unified six of the "Seven Kingdoms" during the initial War of Conquest, the dry desert region of Dorne had remained stubbornly independent for over a century. The Dornish accomplished this by resorting to guerrilla warfare, fleeing before the Targaryen dragons only to return and harass their supply lines as soon as the Targaryens withdrew their forces.
            Seeing Dorne as unfinished business for the Targaryen dynasty, and a blight on their claims to complete mastery of Westeros, Daeron proclaimed that he would invade Dorne and bring it into the royal fold. However, Daeron's advisors initially cautioned him against this course of action, since he was at a significant disadvantage: nearly all of the Targaryen dragons had been wiped out in the civil war two generations previously, and the last of them had died out during the reign of Daeron's father. Aegon the Conquerer, one of the greatest warriors of his time, was unable to take Dorne even with dragons. To this skepticism, Daeron replied; "You have a dragon. He stands before you". The Young Dragon's tactics were brilliant, and his larger strategy was innovative: he feinted an invasion through the passes of the Red Mountains, luring all of the Dornish armies to the west. He then followed by sending the real invasion force to make an amphibious landing at the mouth of the Greenblood River itself, at the doorstep of Sunspear. The Dornish were caught completely off guard and with their army on the other side of the central deserts. Daeron thus gained control of Dorne, succeeding where even Aegon the Conquerer had failed, and this achievement was considered all the more astonishing because he did not have dragons.
            Unfortunately for the Daeron, occupying Dorne proved to be far more difficult than conquering it. The Dornish settled into a long insurgency, repeatedly ambushing the occupying force and then retreating. Dareon lost far more men during the occupation than he did during the conquest itself: ten thousand men in the conquest, another sixty thousand during the occupation. Ultimately, the Tyrell lord he installed as governor of Dorne was assassinated by dumping a hundred red scorpions into his bed, leading to a general insurrection. All that the Young Dragon had accomplished evaporated in a single fortnight, and Daeron himself was killed in battle trying to fight the insurgency. The Young Dragon died young, at only 18 years of age, and after ruling for only four years. Dorne was to remain independent for another two generations, before later uniting with the Targaryen realm through peaceful marriage-alliance (a double-marriage pact in which Daeron's own first cousins, Daenerys and Daeron II, married the Ruling Prince of Dorne and his younger sister).
            Both Robb Stark and Jon Snow idolized the Young Dragon, as have many others, given that he is the type of young conqueror every youth hopes to be. Their uncle Benjen's assessment of Daeron was blunter. He dismissed Daeron's successes as "a conquest that lasted a summer", adding that he lost 10,000 men conquering Dorne and another 50,000 trying to hold it. He cautioned Jon that the real moral of Dareon I's life is that despite winning on the battlefield he lost the war itself. This presages Robb Stark's own death under similar circumstances, despite never having lost a battle. Dareon I was a great military leader, but not a great politician, nor particularly skilled at the day-to-day governance of the realm. Tyrion points out that his uncle and Hand of the King, the eventual Viserys II Targaryen, was the man really responsible for holding the realm together during his reign.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_I_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascDaeronITargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Daeron II Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.32.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Daeron II Targaryen, also called Daeron the Good, was the second King of his name to sit on the Iron Throne and the twelfth king of the Targaryen dynasty to rule the Seven Kingdoms. He was formally styled Daeron of House Targaryen, the Second of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
            Daeron was the son of King Aegon IV Targaryen and Queen Naerys Targaryen, born on the year 159 since Aegon's Landing. He had a sister, Princess Daenerys. He also had a half-brother, Daemon Blackfyre, born of the affair between his father and Queen Daena Targaryen, the sister-wife of Baelor I Targaryen.
            He married Myriah of House Martell at Sunspear. With her, he fathered four sons - Baelor, Aerys, Rhaegel, and Maekar - and one daughter, Aelinor.
            During his reign, his half-brother Daemon rebelled against his rule to claim the Iron Throne for himself. Daeron perished during the Great Spring Sickness. He was succeeded by his son Aerys.
            Daeron II, along with siblings and progenie, is mentioned in the House Targaryen entry of the book, The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms. He is described as purple-blue of eyes, and bring silver of hair and round of shoulders.[1]
            Tyrion Lannister mentions that Daeron the Good is one of the kings analyzed in the classic book, Lives of Four Kings, when he gives a copy of the book to King Joffrey as a wedding present.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daeron II was a dignified man. He had a kind thoughtful face. He was round-shouldered, with thin legs and a small pot belly. His face has a certain quiet strength, though, and his eyes are clear and full of resolve. He wore his father's elaborate dragon Crown. On his coinage, he was depicted as clean-shaven. He was not a warrior by any means, but a cultured, scholarly man who kept company with maesters and other learned men.
            After the failed Conquest of Dorne, King Baelor the Blessed arranged the marriage of his Prince Daeron to Princess Myriah Martell of Dorne as part of a dual marriage pact between the two kingdoms, thus bringing peace to the Seven Kingdoms. He also officiated at the wedding ceremony. Princess Myriah brought many of her native manners and customs with her, and many noble Dornishmen and women flocked to his court, all serving to give life in the Red Keep a foreign flavor, and alienating many of Daeron's nobles and courtiers. In 170AL they had their first son, whom they named Baelor in honor of Baelor the Blessed. Daeron founded a new castle at Summerhall, in the Dornish Marches, roughly where Dorne, the Reach, and the Stormlands come together.
            Late in Aegon IV's reign, it was whispered that his father had come to believe that Daeron was not his son, but the product of an illegitimate union between his wife Naerys and their brother, Aemon, and was planning to disinherit Daeron in favor of Daemon Blackfyre. Others counter that Aegon IV himself started this rumor, because he was disgusted that his trueborn son Daeron was an intelligent and scholarly man, and he simply wished he wasn't really his son. As this theory goes, Aegon IV had became so impressed with his bastard son Daemon Blackfyre, who was a consummate warrior and personally charismatic (though he had no experience at politics), that he increasingly wanted to name Daemon as his official heir. Despite all the taunts, japes and disparities he heaped upon his son, Aegon never formally disowned Daeron. Accounts differ as to why, but the most likely explanation is that Aegon feared a civil war if he did so, as many lords who had grown sick of Aegon's corruption and depravity would fight to defend Daeron's rights (the Martells chief among them).
            Daeron ascended to the throne, however, following Aegon IV's sudden illness and death, following his ascension he wore his father's elaborate dragon crown to legitimise his claim, and gave Daemon lands in the Crownlands to build a castle to quench his claim to the Iron Throne. Nevertheless, several military-minded lords gathered around Daemon and supported his claim to the Iron Throne, causing the First Blackfyre Rebellion.
            Through his youngest son Maekar, Daeron II was the grandfather of Maester Aemon and his younger brother, King Aegon V.
            Daeron II was king at the beginning of the Tales of Dunk and Egg prequel novellas, which begin 90 years before the War of the Five Kings and follow the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall and Aegon "Egg" Targaryen. The first novellas, The Hedge Knight, takes place in the last few months of Daeron II's reign. Daeron II isn't directly involved in the narrative, but his sons Baelor and Maekar feature prominently in its events. The second novella, The Sworn Sword, takes place a year and a half later, after the Great Spring Sickness struck Westeros and after Daeron II died from it. It is possible that Daeron II might appear in any potential live-action adaptation of the Tales of Dunk and Egg.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daeron_II_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascDaeronIITargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Daemon Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.33.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Daemon Targaryen was a Prince of the Targaryen dynasty.
            Daemon once served as Commander of the City Watch of King's Landing, personally transforming it from a group of unruly thugs into a well-trained and well-financed militia.[1]
            During the Dance of the Dragons, as the husband of his niece Rhaenyra Targaryen, he was considered by many to be the most dangerous man in Westeros. After Rhaenyra's son Lucerys Velaryon was killed by Prince Aemond Targaryen, Daemon hired the former goldcloak Blood and the rat-catcher Cheese to kill a son of Aegon II.[1]
            He flew a dragon named Caraxes above Harrenhal, which made Lord Larys Strong kneel to him. This gave the Blacks an advantage, as they had the largest and strongest castle in Westeros. After the "dragonseeds" betrayed his wife, she ordered their heads. However, one of them, Nettles, was Daemon's lover, and was therefore sent away on her dragon at night, so that he would not have to execute her.[1]
            He later challenged his nephew Prince Aemond to a confrontation at Harrnehal. A fortnight later, Aemond came to the Gods Eye, and mocked Daemon for his longevity, and then he told Daemon that he also agrees. When he climbed upon Caraxes in order to battle him, Daemon did not fasten his chains that connected him. Although he was older than Aemond, Caraxes was a lot younger than Aemond's dragon, Vhagar. This meant that Daemon was quickly hidden in clouds, whilst Aemon looked for him. When Caraxes happen upon Vhagar, he bit her neck, but she ripped upon his stomach and tore of one of his wings, but then caused the loss of her teeth. These injuries forced them both to cease flying, and as they tumbled to the water below, Daemon dueled Aemond to the death. As he never fastened his saddle, he stood up on Caraxes and put Dark Sister through Aemond's one remaining eye and through his neck. Both dragons then impacted the water below, killing Daemon.[1]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daemon Targaryen was the uncle and husband of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, whose claim he supported in the Dance of the Dragons. He was Rhaenyra's second husband, following Laenor Velaryon. He was a younger son of Baelon Targaryen, and younger brother to Rhaenyra's father Viserys I Targaryen. Daemon became one of the most experienced warriors of his generation with his constant fighting, and was knighted at the age of sixteen. His grandfather King Jaehaerys I Targaryen gave him the Valyrian steel sword Dark Sister. Daemon rode the dragon Caraxes, a powerful beast who he flew in his constant campaigns in the Stepstones, soon becoming the most battle-hardened of the Targaryen dragons.
            Daemon was the most controversial man of his lifetime, an audacious rogue prince and adventurer who seemed made of good and evil in equal measure. There was never a man so loved and so reviled, and at the same time, as he was.
            Daemon served on Viserys I's Small Council for a time, as Master of Coin and Master of Laws, but grew bored of such administrative work, and became the new Lord Commander of the City Watch. He reorganized the Watch from a loosely assembled and poorly equipped group of street toughs into the formal institution they were known as ever since, giving them their trademark gold cloaks. Daemon vigorously enforced order in the alleys of the city, but was also a well-known rabble-rouser, socializing with the city's dregs as long as they played by his rules. His face became known to every cut-purse, whore, and gambler in Flea Bottom. It became an open secret that Daemon slept with both men and women.
            On several major occasions Daemon clashed with his brother over the matter of succession, only to reconcile with him later. Daemon wanted to be named as heir ahead of Rhaenyra when she was Viserys I's only child and he had no male heirs, but the matter later dropped when Viserys I remarried and had three sons. After one of their estrangements Daemon left the capital, and joined with House Velaryon (supplemented by mercenaries and other adventurers) to lead an invasion of the Stepstones. An alliance of Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh known as the "Kingdom of the Three Daughters" had recently conquered the island chain from its local pirate rulers, but then proceeded to exact tolls on passing shipping that were just as bad, and the Velaryons with their great fleets wanted to rest control of the Narrow Sea back from them. After conquering most of the islands Daemon declared himself King of the Stepstones. Viserys I didn't mind, as he felt that war abroad kept Daemon busy and out of trouble at home. However, the Three Daughters rallied after a few years by allying with Dorne, leading to more years of conflict which gradually shrunk Daemon's holdings.
            By 115 AC, his wife Rhea Royce died back in the Vale (it had been a loveless and childless marriage), and after failing to claim her holdings he stayed on Driftmark with the Velaryons and abandoned his ephemeral sellsword-kingdom in the Stepstones. On Driftmark he wed Lord Corlys Velaryon's daughter Laena Velaryon, the rider of Vhagar, oldest and largest living dragon. They toured the Free Cities for a time and she bore him twin daughters in Pentos, Baela and Rhaena.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daemon_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascDaemonTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Viserys Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.34.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Viserys III Targaryen was the younger brother of the late Rhaegar Targaryen, the older brother of Daenerys Targaryen, and the paternal uncle of Jon Snow. Viserys and Daenerys are the remnants of the exiled House Targaryen following Robert's Rebellion against their father Aerys II Targaryen, the Mad King.
            Viserys claims the title of Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and refers to Robert Baratheon only as "the Usurper". After years spent fruitlessly wandering the Free Cities seeking military support to retake his throne, Viserys and Daenerys became guests of the powerful Magister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos.
            Daenerys marries Drogo and a great celebration is held on the shore outside Pentos. Several Dothraki die in impromptu duels, which Illyrio says is a good sign: a Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair. The bride and groom receive many gifts, but for Dany two are particularly interesting. The first is a box containing three beautiful stones. According to Illyrio these are petrified dragon eggs from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The second is a selection of books containing stories and songs from the Seven Kingdoms, given by Ser Jorah Mormont, an exiled knight of House Mormont. Ser Jorah swears fealty to Viserys as King and offers him his support and advice. For his gift, Drogo gives Daenerys a beautiful silver mare. Viserys instructs his sister to make Drogo happy before Drogo takes her away to consummate the union.[4]
            Viserys decides to travel with Drogo's khalasar until the bargain is fulfilled. Jorah suggests that Viserys remain at Illyrio's manse but Viserys ignores the advice.[5] While traversing the western edge of the Dothraki sea, near Qohor, Daenerys orders the khalasar to halt.
            Viserys grows increasingly agitated by Drogo's inaction and fears the Khal will renege on his promise. Realizing how the Dothraki people have come to love Daenerys makes him feel jealous and inadequate. He tries to steal Daenerys's dragon eggs so he can buy his own army, but Ser Jorah stops him. He accuses Jorah of having physical desires for Daenerys, but says he doesn't care.
            A drunk Viserys later stumbles into Khal Drogo's tent during a feast, and demands to be seated in the front near Drogo, in a place of honor. With Ser Jorah translating, Drogo says that there is a place for him: in the back, with the children and old women. Viserys angrily insists that he is a king, and will be treated as such.
            Khal Drogo addresses Viserys for the first time in the Common Tongue of Westeros, "You are no king." Furious, Viserys unsheathes his sword, too drunk and arrogant to heed Jorah's warning that brandishing a sword in the Dothraki holy city is punishable by death.
            Viserys, believing himself victorious, lowers his guard and is suddenly restrained by Qotho and another bloodrider. Drogo then melts several gold medallions from his belt in a nearby pot. Viserys yells "I am the dragon" and pleads for his life from Daenerys, but when Drogo looks to her, she silently nods. Drogo directly addresses Viserys once more in the Common Tongue, saying, "A crown for a king", and pours the molten gold onto Viserys's head as the promised "terrible golden crown", killing him for his impudence. Viserys dies in agony, and when his dead body slumps to the ground the solidified gold makes a resounding thud. Daenerys coldly remarks that "he was no dragon", as "fire cannot kill a dragon." With Viserys dead, Daenerys is now held by her supporters as the rightful (and last) Targaryen heir to the Iron Throne, although later events will reveal someone who may actually have a stronger claim.[1][9]
            Viserys is mentioned by Daenerys saying that she knew he was a fool but he is - or rather was - the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. But Jorah Mormont dismisses this saying that if Daenerys cannot inherit the Throne, she can conquer it instead like her ancestors.
            Viserys is again mentioned by Daenerys saying that the only family she knew would let a thousand men rape her just to get the Throne.[10]
            Daenerys mentions Viserys at a war council on Dragonstone. She claims that if Viserys had three dragons he would have invaded King's Landing already. She turns her attention to Varys and begin interrogating him over his actions when she and Viserys were in exile. She asks if his "little birds" told him that Viserys was cruel, stupid and weak.[11]
            Daenerys tells Jon that both Viserion and Rhaegal were named for her deceased brothers.[12]
            After being rescued in the mission Beyond the Wall, Jon refers to Daenerys as "Dany" when she is at his bedside. Amused, Dany remarks that nobody has referred to her as Dany since Viserys.[13]
            Viserys was, in numerous ways, the precise opposite of his sister Daenerys Targaryen. He was condescending, violent, arrogant, immoral and extremely cruel. He suffered from maniacal delusions of grandeur, and was intensely self-righteous. Much like Joffrey Baratheon, Viserys believed that people should obey him simply in regards to status and, in his view, birthright. Viserys was a violent and aggressive man, and described his temper as 'a dragon', but also referring to himself as such, showing that he believes he is the greatest of the Targaryens. Viserys's temper hopelessly outweighs his common sense, making him rash and exceptionally reckless.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Viserys_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascViserysTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Viserys II Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.35.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Viserys II Targaryen was the second king of his name to sit on the Iron Throne and the tenth king of the Targaryen dynasty to rule the Seven Kingdoms. Since his nephew and predecessor, Baelor the Blessed, died without issue, all subsequent Targaryens, including the last two currently in the Known World, were descended from him. Viserys II was formally styled Viserys of House Targaryen, the Second of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
            Viserys II was the second son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and her uncle Prince Daemon Targaryen. He and his full-brother Aegon had three older half-brothers - Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey - by their mother's first husband and cousin, Laenor Velaryon.
            Rhaenyra a claimant to the Iron Throne during the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, in which she fought her half-brother, Aegon II. During the war, Viserys and his full-brother Aegon were sent across the Narrow Sea for protection, but were set upon by the Triarchy's fleet. Viserys was captured, while Aegon managed to escape back to Dragonstone, after which their elder half-brother Jacaerys attacked the fleet in the Battle of the Gullet. Jacaerys was killed however, and Viserys disappeared.[1] Many years later, he inherited the throne from his nephew, Baelor I Targaryen. He was the father of Aegon IV Targaryen, who succeeded him to the Iron Throne, Naerys Targaryen, and Aemon Targaryen.
            Viserys II, along with his descendants, are mentioned in the House Targaryen's entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Viserys II was the youngest son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and the younger brother of King Aegon III, the Dragonbane. The father of Aegon III and Viserys II was Rhaenyra's husband and uncle, Daemon Targaryen (younger brother of Viserys II's namesake and grandfather-uncle, King Viserys I). Viserys II served as Hand of the King to both his nephews, Daeron I, the Young Dragon, and Baelor I, the Blessed, helping keep the realm intact first while Daeron warred and then as Baelor prayed. It was rumored that he had the stonemason Baelor had appointed as High Septon poisoned. It was also rumored that he poisoned Baelor, which is the reason he's not remembered fondly.
            Viserys II was clean-shaven with long hair. He had a prominent nose, bushy eyebrows and a shrewd, calculating look to him. He wore the simple crown of Aegon III.
            Grand Maester Kaeth's classic book on the art of good rulership, Lives of Four Kings, actually omits Viserys II from the title. As Tyrion Lannister points out, it would have been more accurate to call it "Lives of Five Kings". Kaeth does briefly mention Viserys II, but devotes very little content to him because he only reigned for one year before his death. Oberyn Martell felt that even this was too much, far more than Viserys II's brief reign merited. Tyrion strongly counter-argues that while Viserys II officially reigned for only one year, he truly ruled and preserved the land for much longer as Hand of the King, keeping the realm together while Daeron obsessed with fruitless conquests and Baelor obsessed with prayer.
            Viserys II was only eight years old when the devastating civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons broke out between his mother Rhaenyra and his half-uncle Aegon II. While his brother Aegon possessed an immature dragon named Stormcloud (who later died), Viserys II did not possess one, though he did have a dragon egg (it is unknown if it ever hatched). As the civil war escalated, Rhaenyra decided to send her two youngest sons to the Free City of Pentos for safety, where Daemon had allies, but their ship never arrived. The Triarchy entered the war on Aegon II's side - an alliance of Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh who had previously fought Daemon in the Stepstones (and whom Pentos was allied with Daemon against). The Three Daughters sent a massive naval fleet to break the blockade of Blackwater Bay which Rhaenyra's Velaryon fleet had established, and the boat carrying her two sons sailed right into it. Aegon III managed to escape on Stormcloud (though it suffered mortal injuries in the process), but Viserys II was captured by the enemy fleet. It is unknown what became of him in the intervening time period before Aegon II's death and the ascension of his older brother to the Iron Throne.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Viserys_II_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascViserysIITargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Viserys I Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.36.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Viserys I Targaryen was the first King of his name to sit on the Iron Throne and the fifth king of the Targaryen dynasty to rule the Seven Kingdoms. He was an ancestor of Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen, and Jon Snow. He was formally styled Viserys of House Targaryen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
            Viserys I was the grandson of King Jaehaerys I, and father of Rhaenyra and Aegon II.
            Viserys I was the grandson of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. He immediately succeeded his grandfather as king because Jaehaerys I ruled for so long that his son (Viserys I's father) predeceased him. His rule was marked by peace, and the rule of House Targaryen was largely uncontested, with the exception of Dorne, although it is believed that this was thanks to Jaehaerys' work during his reign. According to Grand Maester Munkun however, Viserys did not squander the progress made under his predecessor.[1]
            His first wife Aemma Arryn, who was much younger than Viserys, was unable to give Viserys a son, only a daughter (Rhaenyra Targaryen). After his wife's death, he married Alicent Hightower, who gave him two sons, Aegon II and Aemond Targaryen, and one daughter, (Helaena Targaryen). When he became older, his health began to deteriorate. On his deathbed, he refused to change the succession, and proclaimed Rhaenyra as Queen. Unbeknownst to him, his court had split up into two groups, the Greens, who supported Aegon's claim, and the Blacks, who supported Rhaenyra's. These colors were so named because Alicent wore green and Rhaenyra wore black at a tourney. Munkun does not believe Viserys should not be blamed for the civil war between his children. His love for them and his desire for peace kept tensions at bay.[1]
            One night, Viserys was found to have died in his sleep by a servant. This servant told Alicent of this, this proved to be a grave mistake, as Alicent proclaimed Aegon as King, which led to a rebellion led by Rhaenyra, which would later be known as the Dance of the Dragons.[1]
            Viserys I is indirectly referred to when his descendant is introduced by Illyrio Mopatis as "Viserys of House Targaryen, the Third of His Name".[2] When Eddard Stark reads through the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, an entry mentioning Viserys I's descendant King Viserys II is also seen.[3]
            Joffrey Baratheon, while not mentioning Viserys I by name, mentions that Viserys I's daughter Rhaenyra was fed to a dragon by Viserys I's son Aegon II.[4]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Viserys I was the grandson of King Jaehaerys I, who was the longest reigning King of the Seven Kingdoms in history, ruling for 55 years. Jaehaerys I ruled for so long that his son predeceased him, and he was directly succeeded by Viserys I, who then ruled for 26 years. Between the two of them, they presided over an 80 year golden age for the Targaryen dynasty, with entire generations that were born and died knowing only the peace and prosperity brought by the dragon-kings' unification of the continent. As a result of no major wars occurring during this period, however, it is one of the least documented time periods in George R.R. Martin's novels, and therefore details about the generation between Jaehaerys I and Viserys I were very vague - until the publication of the prequel novella The Princess and the Queen in 2013. Another prequel novella published in 2014, The Rogue Prince, covers most of the major events in Viserys I's reign, from his coronation to his death.
            Jaehaerys I and his sister-wife Good Queen Alysanne had nine children. Their eldest son was Aemon, their next son Baelon, and they also had daughters Daella, Saera, as well as five as-yet unknown children. Aemon married Jocelyn Baratheon, and they had one daughter named Rhaenys, but then Aemon died in 92 AL. Jaehaerys declared that his son Baelon was his new heir, despite the fact that Andal custom was that a lord's daughter succeeded ahead of his younger brother (Valyrian customs were more complicated).
            Baelon had two sons: Viserys I and Daemon. Under unknown circumstances Baelon also died, in the year 101 AL. Jaehaerys was quite old by this point (being 70 to 80 years of age), and the death of Baelon (and other family members before) left him despondent for the next two years, until he died in 103 AL. Jaehaerys's daughter Saera had previously left across the Narrow Sea and never returned, adding to his woes. Meanwhile, Daella had married a member of House Arryn, and their daughter Aemma Arryn married Viserys.
            With Jaehaerys I in decline and unable to choose his new heir after Baelon's death, a Great Council was held in 101 AL to determine who would succeed him. Aemon's daughter Rhaenys was a candidate, as were her children Laenor and Laena Velaryon. But the council ruled in favor of Viserys I, given that he was Baelon's heir and Jaehaerys had favored Baelon over his granddaughter Rhaenys.
            During Viserys I's reign, his wife Aemma Arryn died after giving him only one surviving child, his daughter Rhaenyra. Viserys raised Rhaenyra to be his heir but later remarred to Alicent Hightower and had three sons and a daughter by her - including the future king Aegon II Targaryen. Viserys I's brother Daemon married his cousin Laena Velaryon, Viserys I's daughter Rhaenyra married Laenor Velaryon. Laena bore Daemon twin girls, Rhaena and Baela, while Rhaenyra had three sons by Laenor - though many claimed that they were all bastards fathered by her alleged lover, Harwin Strong. Both Laenor and Laena later died, after which Rhaenyra and her uncle Daemon remarried - to each other. Rhaenyra bore Daemon two children, both of them future kings: Aegon III and Viserys II. Two rival factions formed at the royal court, one favoring Rhaenyra and their Velaryon allies, and the other favoring Aegon II and his Hightower supporters. At a tournament, Queen Alicent wore a stunning green dress, while Rhaenyra dressed in bold Targaryen colors of black with red highlights. Their followers started imitating their dress colors to display their loyalty, so that ultimately the pro-Rhaenyra faction became known as "the Blacks" while the pro-Aegon II/Alicent Hightower faction became known as "the Greens". Viserys was not blind to this rivalry and tried to maintain peace between the two factions, but it is possible that at this point no one could stop the coming feud.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Viserys_I_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascViserysITargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Varys</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.37.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Varys, sometimes called the Spider, is a eunuch and was the Master of Whisperers on the King's Small Council until he is forced to flee King's Landing with Tyrion Lannister. He is a skilled manipulator and commands a network of informants across two continents.
            Although he feigns support for her assassination while serving under King Robert Baratheon, Varys's true loyalties are eventually revealed to be to Daenerys Targaryen (though she herself is initially unaware of this), as he believes her rule would be the best way to preserve peace and prosperity in the Seven Kingdoms. He and Tyrion travel to Meereen, joining Daenerys's Small Council. After assisting Tyrion, Grey Worm and Missandei with the rule of Meereen in their Queen's name, Varys returns to Westeros and rallies House Tyrell of the Reach, and the Sand Snakes of Dorne for Daenerys's cause against House Lannister.
            He later joins the Targaryen forces on Daenerys's birthplace, Dragonstone. Despite the loss of the two allies he had recruited, he continues to serve Daenerys as her Master of Whisperers.
            Varys was born across the Narrow Sea in Lys. He was born a slave, and as a child he traveled with a troupe of actors all around the different Free Cities until a sorcerer in the city of Myr made an offer Varys's master couldn't refuse. Varys was sold to the sorcerer, who gave him a potion that made him unable to move or speak but didn't dull his perceptions or sense of pain, and emasculated him (cutting off his testes and penis both) so he could use his sexual organs in a magical ritual, burning them in a brazier. When the sorcerer had thrown Varys's genitals in the brazier, the fire turned blue, the sorcerer called and a voice replied back. Afterward, the sorcerer had no more use for Varys and threw him in the streets to die. Instead, Varys resolved to live no matter what: begging, stealing, and selling the sexual use of what parts remained to him, doing anything to survive. He also became an excellent thief, but soon learned that stolen information was often a far more valuable commodity than any physical goods, and he worked his way up from the slums of Myr. He later started a pick-pocketing business with Illyrio Mopatis and eventually founded a group of spies that he would called his "Little birds". He became a master spy and information trafficker, and his influence and reputation grew so great that he eventually found himself as a member of the Small Council in the Seven Kingdoms. He became one of the chief advisers to Aerys II Targaryen, who at that time, did not trust his wife Rhaella Targaryen, his son Rhaegar Targaryen or his Hand of the King Tywin Lannister. His experience at the hands of the sorcerer had also left him with a bitter hatred for magic and its practitioners.[1]
            When the Mad King arrested Brandon Stark for threatening Prince Rhaegar, Varys and the rest of the Small Council urged the King to pardon Brandon on the grounds that he was the heir to Winterfell and the Prince had abducted his sister. However, the King refused to heed their advice and had both Brandon and his father brutally executed. This led to a rebellion that ultimately toppled the Targaryen dynasty.[3]
            When Tywin arrived at King's Landing with the entire Lannister army at his back, professing loyalty to his beleaguered King after the rebels resounding victory at the Battle of the Trident, Varys warned Aerys not to open the gates, as did Tywin's own son in the Kingsguard, Jaime Lannister. However, Grand Maester Pycelle told Aerys what he wanted to hear: that he could trust Lord Tywin. So Aerys opened the gates and Tywin sacked the city, and Jaime wound up stabbing Aerys in the back.[3][4]
            Despite his previous loyalty to the Targaryens, Varys was pardoned by the new King Robert Baratheon and allowed to keep his position on the Small Council under the advice of his Hand, Jon Arryn.[3]
            Varys is bald, soft, and fat, due to his castration. He often puts on the public persona of being nothing more than a pudgy man well suited to the pleasantries of court life; humble, obsequious, fawning, and a little effeminate. This is simply a facade that Varys has developed, which often leads those who do not know him well to underestimate him as a cheerful and vapid flatterer. In reality he is a cunning and ruthless manipulator of court politics, on-par with Master of Coin Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish, with whom he frequently spars. Unlike Baelish, Varys insists that his goals are to achieve what he honestly feels is best for the realm, though of course, what he and the current ruler feel is best might be two separate things.[5]
            However, despite his ruthlessness and skill at court politics, Varys does not seek power for his own personal ends, but for the good of the common people in both Westeros and Essos. Thus, his loyalty to a monarch depends on how beneficial that monarch is to their subjects; in Season 7 he bluntly remarked to Daenerys that "Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty", indicating that, in his eyes, neither her father nor Robert Baratheon were deserving of his services because they were poor rulers. Varys has a genuinely compassionate side, especially where children are concerned (even the children of his opponents). He once sadly remarked to Eddard Stark that "it's always the innocents who suffer", and told Vala that he has never harmed or sought to harm a child, as he considers them blameless.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Varys</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascVarys</string></dict>
        <key>Brynden Rivers</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.38.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brynden Rivers was one of the infamous Great Bastards of King Aegon IV Targaryen, also known as "Aegon the Unworthy".
            Brynden was one of the infamous Great Bastards of King Aegon IV Targaryen, also known as "Aegon the Unworthy". During the Blackfyre Rebellion he sided with his half-brother Daeron the Good and fought against Daemon Blackfyre in the Battle of Redgrass Field, killing him with an arrow volley.
            Brynden, along with his siblings is mentioned in the House Targaryen entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Brynden Rivers was often called "Bloodraven". While King Aegon IV had many bastard children, the mothers of four of them were also noblewomen, which encouraged him to formally acknowledge them. The four Great Bastards were Daemon Blackfyre (whose mother, secretly, was Daena Targaryen), Aegor "Bittersteel" Rivers (whose mother was a member of House Bracken), Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers (whose mother was a member of House Blackwood), and Shiera Seastar (whose mother was Serenei of Lys, from an ancient Valyrian noble family).
            He was called "Bloodraven" because he had a port-wine stain birthmark covering much of his cheek, which was said to be shaped like a raven, colored blood red against his pale skin. It wasn't really perfectly shaped like a raven, sort of like when you look at a cloud and try to see shapes in it; when Ser Duncan the Tall sees Bloodraven he thinks to himself that it's really more of a blob in shape, though one could plausibly say it looked somewhat like a raven.
            On his deathbed, Aegon IV foolishly had them all legitimized, which led to strife between them and his legitimate heir King Daeron II, tensions which ultimately split realm apart in the devastating civil war known as the Blackfyre Rebellion. Bloodraven sided with their half-brother King Daeron II Targaryen, while his other half-brother, Bittersteel sided with his half-brother Daemon Blackfyre.
            Bittersteel and Bloodraven hated each other, because they both competed for the love of their half-sister Shiera Seastar. Bloodraven asked her to marry him dozens of times and she refused, but she did let him into her bed - though she had many lovers. Shiera, however, completely rejected Bittersteel, and for this he never forgave Bloodraven. It also didn't help that Bittersteel's mother was a Bracken and Bloodraven's mother was a Blackwood, as those two noble families had been feuding for thousands of years. Bittersteel became a great champion and general for the Blackfyres, while Bloodraven became a great champion and general for the Targaryens.
            The First Blackfyre Rebellion ended in 196 AL with the Battle of Redgrass Field, in which Daemon Blackfyre and his eldest two sons were slain. It was Bloodraven's private company of archers, known as the Raven's Teeth, who rained arrows down upon Daemon Blackfyre and his two eldest sons, killing them. Many called Bloodraven a kinslayer for this, though no one knew exactly whose arrows had killed Daemon - he was pierced by many. Bittersteel responded with a ferocious counter-charge and engaged Bloodraven in an epic duel, in which Bloodraven lost an eye. However, Bloodraven's intent was not to defeat Bittersteel, but simply distract him and play for time until reinforcements arrived under Prince Baelor "Breakspear" Targaryen: already fighting Prince Maekar's forces in front, Breakspear caught Bittersteel's remaining forces from the rear in a pincer's movement. The battle was lost but Bittersteel managed to escape, and became one of the major leaders of the surviving Blackfyre forces as they fled into exile in the Free Cities. Daemon left behind five sons and multiple daughters, so Bittersteel became their guardian, secreting them across the Narrow Sea with his dwindling followers. They would continue to harass the Seven Kingdoms with plots and failed rebellions for decades.
            After King Daeron II died in the Great Spring Sickness of 209 AL he was succeeded by his son Aerys I Targaryen - who proved to be a weak, absentee-king, more concerned with introverted scholarly pursuits than any form of governing. When Aerys I was crowned, however, Bloodraven was named as his new Hand of the King, a position he held throughout Aerys I's twelve-year reign. During that time, Bloodraven was the real power behind the throne, and the functional ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Aerys I's rule was deeply troubled by plague, drought, and insurrection, and many blamed Bloodraven because he was in charge, but ultimately he was the man holding the realm back from the brink of chaos during this troubled period.
            During his time as Hand of the King, Brynden was not only an effective administrator and strategist, but a cunning spy-master, and the information from his secret agents greatly aided his grip on power. His spies were so widespread that, also referring to the eye he lost in battle, a popular riddle at the time asked, "How many eyes does Lord Bloodraven have?" to which the answer was "A thousand eyes... and one..."</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Brynden_Rivers</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascBryndenRivers</string></dict>
        <key>Baelor Targaryen </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.39.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Baelor Targaryen was the firstborn son and heir of King Daeron II Targaryen, and served as his Hand during the latter years of his reign.
            Prince Baelor was the eldest son of King Daeron II Targaryen and Queen Myriah Martell. He was the brother of Aerys, Rhaegel, Maekar and Aelinor.
            He was killed when his brother Maekar staved his head in during the Trial by Seven of Duncan the Tall.[1] Had he survived and ascended the throne, he would have ruled as "Baelor II".
            Prince Baelor, along with his family, is mentioned in House Targaryen's entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[2]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Prince Baelor was the eldest son of King Daeron the Good and Queen Myriah, and named after Baelor I. He had the dark hair of his mother, Queen Myriah, which he kept cut short and kept his jaw clean-shaven. His nose had been broken twice. He was known as "Baelor Breakspear" and was the father of Princes Valarr and Matarys Targaryen.
            When the Blackfyre Rebellion was in its early stages, Prince Baelor advocated leniency toward Daemon Blackfyre, a position that was rejected in favor of his uncle Brynden Rivers's more hard line approach. Nonetheless, Baelor accepted the path towards war and distinguished himself by leading the Dornish-Stormlands force which attacked the rearguard of the rebel army during the Battle of Redgrass Field, smashing them against the shield-wall of his brother, Prince Maekar, and inspiring the song The Hammer and Anvil. After the battle, he was named Hand of the King by his father. At some point he was also given the title of Protector of the Realm.
            While participating in a rare trial by seven, Baelor's youngest brother Maekar accidentally dealt him a severe blow to the head with his mace. Baelor had entered the trial wearing his son's lighter armor, which did not fit properly and didn't provide adequate protection. Maekar had not meant to harm Baelor, and Baelor seemed fine at first, acknowledging that it was an accident. Soon, however, Baelor started behaving drunkenly, and he actually had a severe concussion from which he died in a matter of hours. The guilt of accidentally killing his own brother haunted Maekar for the rest of his days.
            When he died, his son Valarr became heir-apparent to the Iron Throne, but he and his younger brother Matarys both died during the Great Spring Sickness only hours before Daeron II. This lead to Daeron II being succeeded by his second son, Aerys I.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Baelor_Targaryen_(son_of_Daeron_II)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascBaelorTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>White Rat</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.40.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>White Rat (Valyrian: Timpa Genes) is a young member of the Unsullied.[1]
            White Rat is a member of the Unsullied, slave soldiers trained by the Good Masters of Astapor. Like all Unsullied, his birth name was cast aside and he was given a new, dehumanizing name as part of the Good Masters' training to shed all sense of self-worth and individuality from their chattel.
            Along with thousands of his 'brothers', White Rat was purchased and liberated by Daenerys Targaryen and chose to fight for her as a free man. Like many Unsullied he chose to keep his slave name after his liberation.
            White Rat was among the Unsullied who oversaw the removal of the large bronze harpy from the top of the Great Pyramid. Like many Unsullied, he regularly visits a brothel and pays a prostitute to lay with him, holding and caressing him, and humming a song in the meantime. During one of his visits, he approaches Vala, a Meereenese prostitute whose company he frequently enjoys. He pays the prostitute, then keeps her from disrobing and removing his trousers - as a eunuch he is unable to have intercourse - instead having her lie behind him and caress him as she hums a melody to him. However, Vala is in league with the Sons of the Harpy and, as White Rat is laying distracted, one of Son of Harpy enters the room and slits his throat. Vala and the murderer watch as White Rat quickly bleeds to death. After learning of his death, Queen Daenerys orders him to be given a funeral at the Temple of the Graces with all honors.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, an Unsullied by the name of Stalwart Shield takes the role of White Rat. Whereas Grey Worm and others chose to keep his demeaning Unsullied name to defiantly reappropriate it from the Good Masters, some of the other Unsullied, however - those who were born into slavery and don't remember their original names - do take up the suggestion to make new dignified names for themselves, such as "Stalwart Shield".
            The TV series may have thought this would take too long to explain, so they renamed the character "White Rat" to keep with the previously established thematic naming of the Unsullied ("Grey Worm", "Red Flea", etc.)
            Stalwart Shield is the first (and not the last, as Ser Barristan warned) of Daenerys's soldiers who is killed by the Sons of the Harpy. Till then, they limited their attacks to unarmed freedmen.
            Like in the show, Stalwart Shield was attacked at a brothel, but was killed in a different manner: he was stabbed multiple times, then the killers filled his throat with goat genitals (Grey Worm removed them before the body was brought to Daenerys). As always, the killers left their mark in the crime scene - a harpy drawn in the blood of their victim. From the look of Stalwart Shield's wounds, Ser Barristan Selmy estimated that there were at least six attackers, and since his scabbard was empty - that he might have injured some of his murderers. Daenerys ordered her servants to conduct an investigation, but the murderers were not caught.
            When his body was brought before Daenerys, she asked Grey Worm why he was in a brothel. Grey Worm answered: "Even those who lack a man's parts may still have a man's heart." In the series, it is Missandei who pursues this line of questioning, and it is framed in the context of her feelings for him.
            In honor of Stalwart Shield's memory, a company of Meereenese freedmen is named after him "Stalwart Shields".</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/White_Rat</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascWhiteRat</string></dict>
        <key>Baelor Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.41.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>King Baelor I Targaryen, full name Baelor of House Targaryen, the First of His Name, called Baelor the Blessed and Baelor the Beloved, was the ninth King in the Targaryen dynasty, ascending the throne after the death of his elder brother Daeron I.
            Baelor was the ninth King in the Targaryen dynasty, ascending the throne after the death of his elder brother Daeron I. He had the Great Sept of Baelor, which became the center of the Faith of the Seven, built during his reign in the city of King's Landing. A large statue of him was later erected in front of the Great Sept.[1]
            During his reign, he had the Maidenvault built inside the Red Keep and imprisoned his three sisters to prevent carnal temptations.[2]
            Though famed for his holiness and piety, he was also a religious zealot. Among Baelor's follies, he named a six-year-old boy as High Septon because he was convinced the child could work miracles after he talked to a dove. He also gave the title to a simple stonemason because he believed he was The Smith reincarnated. Baelor also saved his cousin Aemon Targaryen from a snake pit, thinking that the vipers would not harm a man who was so devoted to the Faith. However, he was bitten twelve times and was forced to lay in bed for six months. He starved himself into an early grave with his frequent religious fasting, believing that the Known world was sinful and food was from the Known world.[3]
            Given that Baelor abhorred desires of the flesh, he died without issue and was succeeded by his uncle and Hand, Viserys II Targaryen.
            When Eddard Stark is dragged out of the dungeons to make a forced (and false) confession of treason on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor, he spots his daughter Arya (who escaped capture by the Lannisters) hiding in the crowd near a statue of King Baelor. He also sees the loyal Night's Watch recruiter Yoren in the crowd, and as the guards lead him past he utters one quick word to him: "Baelor". This directs Yoren's attention to the statue, and notices Arya.
            After Eddard makes his false confession, Grand Maester Pycelle pontificates to the crowd that Baelor taught the realm mercy, which is why Lord Stark's life will be spared and he will be exiled to the Wall. King Joffrey, however, in a display of petty cruelty says that mercy is for women, and demands that Eddard be executed on the spot. Ser Ilyn then beheads Lord Stark. Thanks to Eddard's warning, however, Yoren is able to drag the terrified Arya away and successfully assists her in escaping from the city.[1]
            Tyrion Lannister mentions that Baelor the Blessed is one of the kings analyzed in the classic book, Lives of Four Kings.[4]
            Tywin Lannister recounts Baelor the Blessed's follies, including naming a six-year-old boy as High Septon, while conversing with his grandson, Tommen Baratheon, about the necessary qualities required in a good king.[3]
            While meeting at a chapel deep below the Great Sept of Baelor, the High Sparrow tells Queen Cersei that Baelor built his Great Sept atop the more humble sept. He praises the sept's builders, who didn't leave their names or any sign of their identities, for not inflicting their vanity on those who came after them, unlike Baelor with his "gilded monstrosity".[5]
            Just after the trial of Ser Loras Tyrell, the Great Sept of Baelor is destroyed with wildfire in a plot orchestrated by Cersei Lannister so that she could evade her own trial, which was scheduled to take place just after Loras's, and destroy her enemies.[6]
            In A Song of Ice and Fire, Baelor is the second son of Aegon III, the Dragonbane, and ruled after the death of his brother Daeron I Targaryen, the Young Dragon. He wished to become a septon, but his father refused, instead insisting that he marry his sister Daena in the traditional Targaryen manner. Baelor obeyed, but extremely reluctantly, and refused to consummate the marriage.
            Upon his brother King Daeron I's death, Baelor is said to have begun his reign by walking the Boneway barefoot to make peace with Dorne. It is also said that he saved his cousin Aemon the Dragonknight from a snake pit, where he was bitten many times by the vipers whose venom could not kill him because of his faith in the Seven; this tale may simply be a metaphorical version of his visit to Dorne, referring to Dorne itself as a "snake pit," and the Dornish, "vipers." Whatever the truth, Baelor returned home having negotiated the marriage of his nephew Daeron to Myriah Martell as a means of making peace with Dorne after Daeron I's failed conquest. Years after Baelor died, when Daeron was crowned as King Daeron II, he negotiated the marriage of his much younger sister Daenerys to Maron Martell, thereby uniting the realms.
            Baelor apparently suffered from the Targaryen family's tendency towards insanity, though he exhibited it much differently than others. Instead of being violent or paranoid, Baelor was obsessed with religion and pacifism, to the point of absurdity. Baelor earned the contempt of his nobles by forcing Lord Belgrave to wash the feet of a leper. He tried to replace all the ravens that delivered messages with doves, wore a crown made only of flowers, and once banished all prostitutes from King's Landing. Baelor also confined his sisters Daena, Rhaena, and Elaena in the Maidenvault so they would not tempt him with carnal thoughts.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Baelor_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascBaelorTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Arrax</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.42.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Arrax was one of the dragons that belonged to House Targaryen, which fought during the great civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, during which it was the mount of Rhaenyra Targaryen's son Lucerys Velaryon.
            Arax was one of the twelve dragons, on the island of Dragonstone and one of the six who had a rider. Arax's was Prince Lucerys Velaryon. During the House Targaryen civil war, known as the Dance of the Dragons, on Rhaenyra Targaryen's orders, he flew the young prince to Storm's End in order to gain the support of Borros Baratheon, the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. However, after arriving, Borros almost immediately sent Lucerys away, having already made a pact with Aemond Targaryen. During their way back to Dragonstone, a storm began just after they rose into the sky. Arax was struggling, as Aemond arose on his dragon Vhagar, who was five times the size of Arax. As the castle watchers of Storm's End looked up at the sky, it was illuminated by a single flame, and then followed by a shriek that even drowned out the thunder. Then, Vhagar clasped her teeth so hard around Arax's neck, until he was decapitated. His rider would later fall from his mount and drown in Shipbreaker Bay.
            Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen's three eldest sons (each by Laenor Velaryon) were Jacaerys (born 114 AC),
            Lucerys (born 115 AC), and Joffrey (born 117 AC). The rival faction at court
            who supported her stepmother Alicent Hightower and her children spread the accusation
            that Rhaenyra's three sons were not really Laenor's, but bastards fathered by Harwin Strong.
            In an effort to confirm that he considered Rhaenyra and her sons the true heirs
            to the throne, her father King Viserys I decreed that a dragon egg would be
            put in the cradle of each of the boys, to bond with the dragons that hatched
            from them. Those who doubted the paternity of Rhaenyra's sons also doubted that
            the eggs would ever hatch, but they were quickly disappointed, as each of the
            eggs soon hatched in turn. The hatchlings were named Vermax (bonded with
            Jacaerys), Arrax (bonded with Lucerys), and Tyraxes (bonded with Joffrey). The
            exact date each hatched is not known but the last seems to have hatched by no
            later than about 120 AC.
            At the start of the civil war Prince
            Jacaerys flew north as a messenger on Vermax. Arrax and his rider were slain by
            Prince Aemond Targaryen and Vhagar in the skies over Shipbreaker Bay. Three days later, the dragon's
            head and neck washed up beneath the cliffs below Storm's End, along with Prince Lucerys' corpse.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Arrax</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascArrax</string></dict>

            During the Dance of the Dragons, an angry mob of smallfolk stormed the Dragonpit where House Targaryen stabled their dragons. Tyraxes was among the five dragons killed, as the mob took advantage of Tyraxes getting entangled in his chains.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire, Tyraxes bound to Prince Joffrey Velaryon, son of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, during the Dance of the Dragons.
            Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen's three eldest sons (each by Laenor Velaryon) were Jacaerys (born 114 AC), Lucerys (born 115 AC), and Joffrey (born 117 AC).

            At the start of the civil war Prince Jacaerys flew north as a messenger on Vermax. Tyraxes retreated into his lair roasting every would-be dragon slayer as they rushed after him. His entrance was made impassable by the corpses. The mob entered a back entrance instead. The dragon's chain entangled Tyraxes as he turned and was slain. Half a dozen men and one woman claimed to have dealt the death blow.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tyraxes</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascTyraxes</string></dict>
        <key>Sheepstealer</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.44.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sheepstealer was one of the dragons that belonged to House Targaryen. During the great civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, it was the mount of the bastard girl Nettles.
            Sheepstealer was a wild dragon, left riderless and unclaimed on Dragonstone island for many years.
            During the Dance of the Dragons, Rhaenyra Targaryen's faction - the Blacks - was based on the island, but realized that they possessed more dragons than riders. It was believed that only those of the Targaryen bloodline could successfully bond with dragons, but over the generations the Targaryens had produced numerous bastard children and grandchildren with the commoners of the isle.
            Rhaenyra put out a call for any who believed they were a bastard of Targaryen blood to attempt to mount and bond the six riderless dragons, offering reward of gold and title. Many of these bastards - called Dragonseeds - died in the attempt, but ultimately four of them succeeded. Sheepstealer was claimed by the bastard girl called Nettles.
            Nettles and Sheepstealer fought on Rhaenyra's side through the war, and later accompanied Rhaenyra's husband Daemon Targaryen to the Riverlands to chase after Aemond Targaryen, who rode the massive Vhagar. Daemon riding his dragon Caraxes and Nettles riding Sheepstealer spent a long time hunting Aemond but he always chose to flee their approach and attack another village elsewhere, rather than face two to one odds.
            After the other dragonseeds Hugh Hammer and Ulf the White betrayed Rhaenyra at the Sack of Tumbleton, she grew to believe that all bastards are untrustworthy, and sent orders to have Nettles's severed head delivered to her - rumors that Nettles was also having a sexual affair with Daemon may have also been a factor. The letter reached Daemon first, however, and he was stunned. He sent Nettles away at dawn, riding Sheepstealer away into the mists. Meanwhile, Daemon decided to face Aemond and Vhagar in a one on one fight to the death, resulting in the death of all four combatants at the Battle Above the Gods Eye.[1]
            Sheepstealer was one of six wild riderless dragons nesting on Dragonstone when the Dance began. Of these, three were only semi-wild, in that they had been ridden before and were generally accustomed to the presence of humans - thus when Rhaenyra put out the call for Targaryen bastards to try to claim them, these dragons (Vermithor, Silverwing, and Seasmoke) only killed a few before accepting new mounts.
            The other three dragons, however, had grown to adulthood never having been claimed by any rider. As a result they were much more distrustful of humans. Given that they were never claimed by riders they were also never formally named, but over the decades the commoners of the island had just applied descriptive nicknames to each: the Cannibal, the Sheepstealer, and the Grey Ghost. The oldest and largest of these was the Cannibal - with solid coal-black scales, he was greatly feared and possibly insane, and so-named because he was known to actually feast on dead dragons, hatchlings, and eggs. No one was stupid enough to try to claim the Cannibal, though he still attacked and killed some of the dragonseeds who drew too close while searching for other dragons. Grey Ghost, meanwhile, was an extremely shy and timid creature who fled at the mere sight of men in the distance; it was barely seen for years at a time, and even fed on fish out in the ocean to avoid the sight of commoners on the island. Grey Ghost wasn't dangerous like the Cannibal and some did attempt to seek him out, but simply finding him was too difficult, much less trying to ride him, and indeed he was never ridden throughout his life.
            The last of the wild dragons was called "Sheepstealer" because he had a taste for mutton, and would often snatch sheep from flocks around the shores of Blackwater Bay. He could at least be approached without making him flee (like Grey Ghost) nor was he a savage monster that killed on sight (like the Cannibal) but he was still as untamed as a wild stallion. Many would-be dragon-riders died attempting to master Sheepstealer - more than died trying to mount the three semi-wild ones put together.
            Many more died attempting to mount or even approach the three truly wild dragons, until the remaining volunteers despaired that it was simply impossible and gave up. Only after all the others had failed did the young teenaged girl Nettles make her attempt, using cunning and patience that the earlier dragonseeds had lacked. Rather than walk right up to the dragon, she would slaughter a sheep and leave it out every day for him to eat, patiently drawing closer every day until he became accustomed to her presence, and eventually accepted her as a rider.
            Sheepstealer's scales are described as having a "mud brown" color which many found to be very ugly - compared to the beautiful shining gold scales of Sunfyre, or the lustrous reds, silvers, and blues of others. This may be one of the reasons he was never claimed as a hatchling, in favor of the others. At the time of the Dance, Sheepstealer was actually one of the older and more powerful dragons: it is said that he was hatched "when the Old King was young" - Jaehaerys I Targaryen, Rhaenyra's great-grandfather, and putting Sheepstealer around 80 years old when Nettles claimed him. Dragons always grow throughout their lives so he must have been quite large.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sheepstealer</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascSheepstealer</string></dict>
        <key>Last dragon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.45.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The last dragon ​belonging to House Targaryen died many decades before Robert's Rebellion. Its death marked the extinction of dragons in Westeros and beyond until the birth of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons.
            ​At Vaes Dothrak, Viserys Targaryen bathes with Doreah and she tells him that she wants to see a dragon more than anything and asks if he has seen one. He replies that he has not, as the last one died many years before he was born. He tells her that he saw their skulls when he was a child, as they were used to decorate the Red Keep. He tells her that the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch. He says that they were stunted and wrong, their skulls no bigger than a dog's.[1]
            Petyr Baelish believes that the last dragon's death was a precursor of the eventual downfall of the Targaryens.[2]
            While unchaining Viserion and Rhaegal in the catacombs beneath Meeren's temple, Tyrion Lannister reminisced about wanting a dragon when he was young, but being told by his Uncle that the last dragons had died a century prior.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the last dragon was a green female who died during the reign of King Aegon III Targaryen, who earned the nickname "The Dragonbane" as he was blamed for her death. She was sickly, small, misshapen and stunted, with withered wings. Her name is not known.
            Although she was sickly she did lay a clutch of five eggs, which never hatched.
            In The Hedge Knight, the first of the Tales of Dunk and Egg prequel novellas, Ser Duncan the Tall remembers his late mentor Ser Arlan of Pennytree telling him that he had seen the last dragon when he was a child.
            When Tyrion Lannister views the nineteen dragon skulls stored in a dank cellar in King's Landing he recalls seeing a matched pair of skulls, no bigger than mastiff’s skulls, and oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. He thinks to himself that they were the last of the Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long. He remembers telling his uncle Gerion as a child that he wanted a pet dragon, but Gerion only laughed and told him that the last one had died over a century ago.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Last_dragon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascLastdragon</string></dict>

            During the Dance of the Dragons, an angry mob of smallfolk stormed the Dragonpit where House Targaryen stabled their dragons. Shrykos was among the five dragons killed, being slain by Hobb the Hewer.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire, Shrykos was a young she-dragon bound to Prince Jaehaerys Targaryen, son of King Aegon II Targaryen during the Dance of the Dragons. She was never ridden.
            Shrykos died in the Dragonpit when it was invaded by a half-crazed angry mob after a one-handed prophet called the Shepherd began to rant against all dragons everywhere. There is little doubt that Shrykos killed scores of people in the Dragonpit before being slain. Shackled by her heavy chains, Shrykos was slain by a woodsman known as Hobb the Hewer who leapt onto her neck driving his axe into her skull as she roared and twisted, trying to throw him off. With his legs locked around the dragon's neck, Hobb delivered seven blows and each time his axe came down he roared out the name of each of the the Seven. It was the Stranger's blow that slew the dragon, his axe crashed through scale and bones into Shrykos's brain.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Shrykos</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascShrykos</string></dict>
        <key>Sunfyre</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.47.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sunfyre​, known as Sunfyre the Golden​, was a dragon bred by the Targaryen dynasty. He was the personal steed of Aegon II Targaryen.
            Sunfyre was the mount of Aegon II Targaryen during the Dance of the Dragons.
            As the conflict intensified into full scale war, Aegon II grew increasingly impatient with his grandfather Otto Hightower's diplomatic maneuverings, and wanted to launch an immediate attack on Rhaenyra's followers on the mainland. With Lord Commander Criston Cole, he launched a campaign into the east of the Crownlands held by the Blacks.
            This culminated in the Battle of Rook's Rest, when Rhaenys Velaryon arrived riding the large older dragon Meleys to attempt to lift the siege of the castle. This was all a trap, however, as the Greens had kept two of their own dragons hidden and in reserve so they could take Meleys in an uneven fight. Aegon II appeared riding the younger but strong Sunfyre, and his younger brother Aemond Targaryen also attacked riding the massive Vhagar, last of the first generation Targaryen dragons.
            Rhaenys could not prevail against such odds, yet she did not flee but flew head-on to meet her attackers. Meleys was still so large and powerful that she put up a brutal fight. When the dust settled Meleys was dead and Vhagar was relatively unharmed, but Sunfyre had been nearly killed and permanently maimed. Meleys managed to nearly rip one of his wing-arms completely from his body, and as for Aegon II, he was left horrifically burned and with multiple broken bones. Aegon II was taken back to King's Landing, but he was left sedated with Milk of the Poppy for months, and command fell to his yougner brother Aemond.
            Sunfyre survived the battle but the world's most beautiful living dragon was left crippled and heavily scarred.
            Yet even after Rhaenyra captured King's Landing, her forces could not find Sunfyre. A year after Rook's Rest, Aegon II suddeny seized Rhaenyra's home base at Dragonstone, with the wounded and dying Sunfyre by his side. When Rhaenyra was forced to flee King's Landing due to a city-wide riot, she returned to Dragonstone only to be confronted by her half-brother. Aegon II then had Rhaenyra fed to his dragon Sunfyre while forcing her last remaining son to watch (Aegon III Targaryen). The dragon roasted her alive and devoured her in six bites - the seventh bite he left (said to be The Stranger's bite), leaving one of her feet as the only part he didn't consume.[1]
            Sunfyre was a relatively young dragon given that Aegon II appears to have been his first and only rider. He was not considered one of the "large" dragons like Caraxes or Syrax. At the same time he was very much at the upper end of the "medium" dragons, very strong and formidable in combat.
            The Season 5 Blu-ray featurette about the Dance of the Dragons condenses the story significantly and thus doesn't really explain what happened to Sunfyre between Rook's Rest and when he later showed up on Dragonstone a full year later, only to say that the dragon was dying.
            In short, Sunfyre couldn't fly for months due to his crippled wing, and even then the bones healed at a bad angle. He eventually regained the ability to fly again, albeit awkwardly - enough to travel from place to place but not enough to maneuver well against other dragons in the air.
            Aegon II escaped King's Landing to hide out as a disguised commoner in a fishing village on Dragonstone island - the last place that Rhaenyra would look. For some reason, and the historians still debate this, Sunfyre also subsequently flew to Dragonstone after he gained enough strength to fly. Some think it was simply a nesting instinct, given that all the dragons were hatched on the Dragonmont volcano and it thought it would be safe there. Others who think dragons are more intelligent or have some sort of magical pyschic bond with their riders think that Sunfyre sensed where Aegon II was. Whatever the case, when Sunfyre arrived he fought and killed a remaining riderless dragon, Grey Ghost - though he took yet more wounds in the process.
            It wasn't long before Aegon II and Sunfyre found each other again, and both crippled beings found new purpose in each other. Aegon II then recruited traitors among the skeleton garrison that Rhaenyra had left on Dragonstone with promises of reward, and moved to take the castle. Not all went as he had planned, however, for as he flew Sunfyre into the courtyard to stake his claim, he was attacked by Daemon's young daughter Baela riding the dragon Moondancer - an even younger dragon barely large enough to carry the 13 year old girl. Moondancer was quick and nimble, however, while Sunfyre was still half-crippled and slowed by his injuries. They were therefore evenly matched and their duel was ferocious. It culminated when Sunfyre tackled Moondancer in mid-air and drove her into the ground below: his larger size meant that he survived the fall while she was killed. Nonetheless Sunfyre was mortally injured by this fight, and would never fly again.
            When Rhaenyra arrived back on Dragonstone and encountered Sunfyre, the once most beautiful dragon in the world had been reduced to a horrifying spectacle: open wounds along his neck, back and belly, bent broken wings that would never fly again, and even missing one of his eyes. Sunfyre never recovered from his injuries: Aegon II's men attempted to nurse him back to health by bringing him sheep to eat, but eventually he succumbed to his massive internal injuries only six agony-filled weeks after he ate Rhaenyra. Aegon II wept at his passing.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sunfyre</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascSunfyre</string></dict>
        <key>Rhaegal</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.48.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rhaegal is one of the three dragons born on the Dothraki Sea, along with Drogon and Viserion. He is named after Daenerys Targaryen's eldest brother, Rhaegar. He can be distinguished by his green and bronze colored scales, and his yellow-orange colored wings.
            He is born along with his two siblings after Daenerys has their eggs placed on the funeral pyre erected for her deceased husband, Khal Drogo. As she rises unharmed from the ashes of the pyre on the morning following the funeral, he is cradled by Dany at the time.[1]
            Rhaegal is taken along with his "brothers" to Qarth. He is stolen by Xaro Xhoan Daxos, along with Drogon and Viserion. Daenerys enters the House of the Undying to retrieve them and eventually finds her three dragons chained. Pyat Pree attempts to chain her with magic, claiming that her dragons make his magic strong, and that she makes them stronger, thus she will stay with them for an eternity. She whispers to her dragons the command of fire, and the three of them burn Pyat Pree alive, releasing his magic.[2]
            Rhaegal, along with his brothers, accompanies Daenerys on her journey from Astapor and Yunkai. When Daenerys has a meeting with a Razdal mo Eraz, of the Wise Masters of Yunkai, Rhaegal hisses at the slaver along with his brother Drogon when he comes too close to Daenerys. He then fights over a piece of meat with his brothers when Daenerys makes a show of force to intimidate Razdal.[3] After Daenerys frees the slaves of Yunkai, Rhaegal takes to the sky with his siblings at Daenerys's command; a show of both power and freedom.[4]
            Rhaegal is seen with his brother Viserion fighting over a dead lamb. Drogon, who is now visibly bigger than them, quickly takes the lamb as his brothers squeal for him to share. He sets the corpse down and the three begin to eat.[5]
            In response to Drogon's killing of a three-year-old girl named Zalla, Daenerys leads Viserion and Rhaegal into the catacombs of Meereen, where she chains them up.[6]
            Daenerys finally decides to reenter the catacombs to attempt to regain control over her dragons. Rhaegal and Viserion, who have grown even larger during their time in captivity, immediately lash out and breathe fire at the sight of their mother who imprisoned them.[7]
            Some time later, Daenerys, reeling over the death of Ser Barristan Selmy, arrests the leaders of Meereen's great families and brings them to meet Rhaegal and Viserion. Rhaegal roasts one of nobles and tucks in, sharing the meal with Viserion. Her point proven, Daenerys leaves, sarcastically saying that she doesn't want to overfeed the dragons.[8]
            In the Great Pyramid, Tyrion Lannister learns that Rhaegal and Viserion have not been eating anything ever since their mother had left. He decides to free them, knowing that they will be better off that way.
            Accompanied to the entranceway by Varys, Tyrion ventures alone into the catacombs and encounters Rhaegal and Viserion for the first time. Despite their initial hostility towards him, Tyrion remains calm, assuring them he is a friend of Daenerys and only wants to help. He manages to earn their trust and unshackle them while telling them the story of how he wanted a dragon for his nameday, only to be disappointed by uproarious laughter from his family and the cold truth from his father. Once free, the dragons immediately depart into the darkness behind them while Tyrion quickly exits the catacombs with Varys.[9]
            After Daenerys returns to Meereen and pits Drogon against the fleet assembled by Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis, Rhaegal and Viserion break out of the catacombs and join their mother and brother in destroying the the slavers' fleet with dragon fire, decisively breaking the Second Siege of Meereen. This defeat marks the end attempt to reintroduce slavery to Meereen.[10]
            Some time later, Rhaegal and his brothers accompany their mother and her large army on a voyage to retake Westeros by soaring above the armada.[11]
            Rhaegal and his brothers fly ahead of their mother as she lands on Dragonstone. They investigate the island as Daenerys enters and secures the castle.[12]
            Later, Daenerys tells Jon that both Viserion and Rhaegal were named for her deceased brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar, respectively.[13]
            Rhaegal and his brothers fly North of the Wall to help kill the army of White Walkers that are advancing on Jon Snow and the others during their Wight Hunt. During the battle, the Night King fatally wounds Viserion with an ice spear to the neck. Rhaegal swoops after him in a desparate attempt to help, but it's too late; he can only cry in despair as Viserion crashes through the frozen lake and slowly sinks into the waters.[14]
            Daenerys brings Rhaegal to the Dragonpit, as a show of power: he circles overhead as she lands on Drogon's back. Bringing Rhaegal proves to be a minor error, however, as Cersei Lannister notices Viserion's absence and correctly concludes that something has happened to him, brushing off Jaime's suggestion that the third dragon is guarding the fleet.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaegal</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascRhaegal</string></dict>

            He is born along with his two siblings after Daenerys has their eggs placed on the funeral pyre erected for her deceased husband, Khal Drogo. As she rises unharmed from the ashes of the pyre on the morning following the funeral, he climbs on her shoulder and lets out a powerful scream, announcing the return of dragons to the world.[1]
            As her small khalasar travels east, Daenerys tries to get Drogon to eat, but he refuses the raw meat she offers, just as his siblings do.[2] Later, while Daenerys is staying at Qarth, she teaches Drogon to breathe fire for the first time, roasting a small piece of meat, which he then eats.[3] Drogon and his siblings are kidnapped to the dismay of Daenerys.[4] In a meeting with the Thirteen, Pyat Pree, a warlock, reveals he has taken them to the House of the Undying and claims that he is eager to reunite Daenerys with her children.[5]
            After Daenerys enters the House of the Undying, she eventually finds her three dragons chained to a small dais. Pyat Pree suddenly appears and chains Daenerys with magic, saying that her dragons make his magic strong, that she makes the dragons stronger, and thus she must stay in the House of the Undying forever.
            An unconcerned Daenerys whispers "dracarys" to Drogon, and after a couple of tries, he spits a large plume of fire at Pyat, igniting the warlock's robes. The other two dragons follow their brother's lead and the three of them burn Pyat Pree alive, free themselves and Daenerys from their chains, and set the House of the Undying alight.
            Drogon has grown significantly since leaving Qarth, and is about the size of a small dog by the time Daenerys and her party reach Astapor. He swoops into the water and catches a fish, which he then cooks in mid-air and devours. Daenerys notes that he is not growing fast enough for her to use him to conquer the Seven Kingdoms in the immediate future.
            At Slaver's Bay, she speaks with Kraznys mo Nakloz, as they attempt to work out a deal for his slave soldiers, the Unsullied. Daenerys says she will take all eight thousand Unsullied, including those in training. To this Kraznys laughs at her and says even with the wealth she possesses she could afford hardly over one hundred Unsullied. Daenerys surprises him by reminding him she has Dragons, and she will give him one. They strike a deal that she may have all the Unsullied, as well as those still in training, in exchange for her biggest dragon.
            Sometime later the exchange is made, and Daenerys meets with the Good Masters and gives the chained Drogon over to Kraznys, who in turn gives her the golden scourge which signifies absolute authority over the Unsullied. Once the Unsullied are under her command, Kraznys angrily comments that Drogon does not obey him, to which she responds, in Valyrian, that he does not obey because dragons are not slaves. Daenerys orders Kraznys's death with a harsh "dracarys". Drogon then takes flight and strafes the guards and Good Masters in the walls above the plaza.
            After the Sack of Astapor is finished, Daenerys's khalasar and her new Unsullied army march out of the city, Drogon and his brothers flying overhead.
            Drogon and his brothers are present in Daenerys' tent when a Wise Master from Yunkai arrives to entreat with their mother. Drogon, now about the size of a large dog, aggressively barks at the Master when he gets too close to Daenerys. Later, the Wise Master has two slaves place a chest full of gold near Drogon. While the two talk, Daenerys throws a piece of meat to Viserion, and Drogon attempts to steal it from his brother. When the negotiation goes sour, Drogon growls at the Wise Master for threatening Daenerys. Scared for his safety, the Wise Master tells his slaves to take back the gold and leave. Drogon stops them in their tracks, hissing and growling.
            Drogon and his siblings are now the size of small horses. He quietly rests his head on his mother's lap as she caresses him. When his two siblings come back with a dead lamb, he joins the fight over the carcass. His mother tries to calm him down, and without warning, Drogon snaps at her with a hiss; a warning to not interfere. He then roars and goes to contest the kill. Daenerys is shaken, fearing that she is losing influence over her "children", as dragons can never be truly tamed.[6]
            On the run from the Lost Legion, Asher Forrester, his uncle Malcolm Branfield, and partner Beskha encounter Drogon inside a cave, but manage to escape. Asher later reports the find to Daenerys while asking for help, though she does not believe him, even with evidence to support the claim.
            Following Daenerys's conquest of Meereen, Drogon, who is now the size of a small ship, kills and eats the goats of a local goatherd. The goatherd lays the charred bones of his flock before Daenerys in her throne room, hoping he has not angered the new queen and that this was a form of punishment. Daenerys apologizes for Drogon's actions and promises to pay the goat herder back three times the worth of his lost goats.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Drogon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascDrogon</string></dict>
        <key>Caraxes</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.50.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Caraxes was the dragon ridden by Prince Daemon Targaryen during the Dance of the Dragons.
            During the Dance of the Dragons, Caraxes killed and was killed by Vhagar, last of the three original Targaryen dragons and largest living dragon during the civil war, in the Battle Above the Gods Eye.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Caraxes was one of the older and larger dragons during the Dance of the Dragons. His scales were colored red, leading to him being called "the Blood Wyrm".
            Daemon Targaryen rode Caraxes in his frequent campaigns in the Stepstones. As a result Caraxes was not only one of the larger dragons during the Dance, but possibly the most battle-hardened and experienced in war. Indeed, only Vhagar had ever been ridden in major wars before, due to the eighty years of peace the realm had enjoyed since King Maegor the Cruel died - and Vhagar, while formidable, had not been used in combat in the years leading up to the Dance, the way that Caraxes was. Opposing armies were known to often simply flee when Caraxes approached.
            When Rhaenyra captured King's Landing in a surprise attack, Daemon rode Caraxes in the assault while Rhaenyra rode Syrax.
            Later in the war, Aegon II's younger brother Aemond Targaryen resorted to a one-man war riding Vhagar, burning out much of the Riverlands. Daemon hunted him for a long time on Caraxes, aided by the dragonrider Nettles on Sheepstealer, but eventually he returned alone to Harrenhal (which Vhagar had burned out earlier in the war) waiting as a challenge for Aemond to arrive. Caraxes was formidable but Vhagar was twice his size, nearly as large as Balerion had been during the War of Conquest. Facing him alone was the only way to draw Vhagar out, however, as Aemond had avoided ambushes by multiple other dragons. Aemond arrived, exchanged his final challenges to Daemon, then both took to the air on their dragons.
            The resulting Battle Above the Gods Eye was one of the most epic dragon-versus-dragon fights of the entire civil war, as two of the greatest living dragons fought in the air. Their shrieks shattered every remaining window in the castle and could be heard for miles around. Their fire-breath filled the sky so that fishermen in the lake thought that the whole sky was aflame. In the end, Caraxes dove down from the sun on Aemond's blind side (due to his missing eye). Caraxes slammed into Vhagar and they both continued to fight in free fall. Vhagar tore out Caraxes's belly, and used her massive jaws to rip one of his wing-arms completely off - but Caraxes sank his teeth into Vhagar's throat and maintained a death grip. As the two dragons grappled, Daemon rose from his saddle and made a stunning mid-air leap from his dragon to Aemond on Vhagar's back. Wielding the Valyrian steel sword Dark Sister (which had once been carried by Vhagar's previous rider, Visenya Targaryen, Daemon thrust his blade through Aemond's empty eye socket - the force of his impact as he landed driving the sword through the back of Aemond's head. Both dragons plummeted into Gods Eye below. Nothing could have survived the fall and nothing did: Caraxes had ripped out Vhagar's throat and she bore the brunt of the impact, killing her. Daemon's corpse was never found, but Aemond's was found years later with Dark Sister still thrust through it. Caraxes, somehow, was still alive after his massive injures and the fall, but not for long. Missing a wing and with his intestines trailing behind him out of his open belly, he somehow found the strength to pull himself out of the lake onto the shore, where the dragon soon died before the walls of Harrenhal. The battle was a heavy blow for both Rhaenyra's and Aegon II's factions: each side lost one of their greatest champions, as well as each side's strongest dragon. The world has not seen their like again.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Caraxes</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascCaraxes</string></dict>
        <key>Stormcloud</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.51.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Stormcloud was one of the dragons that belonged to House Targaryen. It was bonded with Aegon III Targaryen, though he had yet to ride it when the great civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons began.
            Stormcloud was a young dragon when the Dance began, not quite a hatchling anymore but not yet big enough for even a boy to ride.
            As the war between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon II Targaryen progressed, she decided that she should send the two youngest of her five sons, who were only small boys, to safety in the Free Cities. The young Aegon III Targaryen and Viserys II Targaryen boarded the ship, taking Stormcloud with them as they set out from Dragonstone to cross the Narrow Sea.
            Soon afterwards, however, their ship was intercepted by an enemy fleet bearing down on the island. Aegon III escaped by desperately clutching on to Stormcloud, who was mortally wounded by an arrow bolt in the throat. Despite both his wounds and the fact that he still wasn't really big enough to carry the boy's weight, Stormcloud somehow found the strength to fly the terrified Aegon all the way back to Dragonstone. Upon landing, Stormcloud collapsed in exhaustion and soon died. His sacrifice did, however, give Rhaenyra warning of the approaching enemy fleet, leading to the Battle of the Gullet.[1]
            Stormcloud was one of the youngest dragons, too small to ride when the Dance began - though ultimately he died saving Aegon III by flying him to safety under great strain and badly wounded by arrows.
            Stormcloud was bonded with Aegon III, the second-youngest of Rhaenyra's five sons, while her fifth and youngest son Viserys II possessed no dragon, only an unhatched egg. The "Dance of Dragons" Season 5 Blu-ray featurette makes a mistake with this: without giving names, it says that Rhaenyra's "youngest son" flew his young dragon back to her castle after his ship was attacked, leaving the other behind and assumed captured or dead. It even uses the same character artwork: the shortest and youngest of Rhaenyra's sons at her council scene is presumably Viserys II, wearing a red jacket, and later he is the one seen climbing off the dying Stormcloud. This is apparently just an unintentional mistake and not a conscious change to the TV continuity, and thus is disregarded.
            The coloration of Stormcloud's scales is unknown.
            Stormcloud was one of the youngest and smallest dragons, not quite a "hatchling" anymore but not big enough that Aegon III had attempted to ride him yet. The next largest dragon was apparently Moondancer, which belonged to his half-sister Baela Targaryen, though Moondancer was also too small to ride at the beginning of the war (though she was big enough near the end of it). Meanwhile, Rhaenyra's third son Joffrey Velaryon possessed the young dragon Tyraxes, who was big enough for short flights but deemed not worth risking in combat. Aegon II's firstborn son and daughter also possessed two dragon hatchlings, Morghul and Shrykos.
            The exact lineage of the Targaryen dragons is unknown, though it is possible that the dragon eggs which several of Rhaenyra's sons hatched were laid by her own dragon, Syrax (she is mentioned as laying new clutches of eggs, implying she had previous ones). Dragons at the time of the Dance generally fell into four broad categories, possibly reflecting which generation each one was from: Vhagar was huge and last of the first-generation dragons, while Vermithor and Meleys were still large second-generation dragons. Then there were apparently third-generation medium-to-light dragons, still at least big enough to ride in war, ranging rom Sunfyre to Vermax. Below that there were the three hatchlings at the start of the war, Stormcloud, Morghul, and Shrykos, who may have been the fourth dragon generation in Westeros. This is only conjecture, however, as dragon eggs can lay dormant for many generations out of sequence - i.e. for all we know, both Vermithor and Stormcloud were hatched from eggs laid by Vhagar herself, but Stormcloud's egg hatched a hundred years later.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Stormcloud</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascStormcloud</string></dict>
        <key>Vermax</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.52.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vermax was one of the twelve dragons, on the island of Dragonstone and one of the six who had a rider. Vermax's was Prince Jacaerys Velaryon. During the House Targaryen civil war, known as the Dance of the Dragons, on Rhaenyra Targaryen's orders, he flew the young prince to the Vale of Arryn and The North, in order to recruit supporters for Rhaenyra's faction, the Blacks. He was successful. After Aegon III Targaryen and Viserys II Targaryen, were ambushed by Greens on the way to Essos, only Aegon returned and Viserys was captured by the enemy. Jacaerys vowed to rescue his younger brother, taking his dragon, to the enemy fleet. However, the Green archers shot Vermax numerous times until, he fell into the water below. The archers continued to shoot at both Vermax and Jacaerys until they died beneath the water.
            When Prince Jacaerys Velaryon was young, there were rumours that he was a bastard, fathered by Ser Harwin Strong, instead of his mother Rhaenyra Targaryen's husband, Ser Laenor Velaryon. The rumours were spread by Queen Alicent Hightower and her followers at court. Those who doubted the paternity of Jacaerys and his brothers also doubted that the dragon eggs the boys had been given would ever hatch, but they were quickly disappointed, as each of the eggs soon hatched in turn. The hatchling that bonded with Prince Jacaerys was Vermax.
            By the time the Dance of the Dragons began, Vermax was big enough to ride. Prince Jacaerys flew north on his back, as a messenger for his mother, Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, to treat with Lady Jeyne Arryn, Lord Manderly, and Lord Cregan Stark. The mission was a success.The Testimony of Mushroom claims that Vermax laid a clutch of eggs in the depths of the crypts of Winterfell, but this tale is most likely false.
            Prince Jacaerys used Vermax in battle, during the Battle in the Gullet. There, Vermax attacked a fleet, but he flew too low and went crashing down into the sea. Differing tales are told of how and why the dragon fell. Jacaerys also perished.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Vermax</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascVermax</string></dict>
        <key>Vermithor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.53.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vermithor was one of the dragons that belonged to House Targaryen. It was once the mount of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. During the great civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, Vermithor was the mount of Hugh Hammer.
            Vermithor was left riderless on Dragonstone island for many years after the death of King Jaehaerys I. During the Dance of the Dragons, Rhaenyra Targaryen's faction - the Blacks - was based on the island, but realized that they possessed more dragons than riders. It was believed that only those of the Targaryen bloodline could successfully bond with dragons, but over the generations the Targaryens had produced numerous bastard children and grandchildren with the commoners of the isle.
            Rhaenyra put out a call for any who believed they were a bastard of Targaryen blood to attempt to mount and bond the six riderless dragons, offering reward of gold and title. Many of these bastards - called Dragonseeds - died in the attempt, but ultimately four of them succeeded. Vermithor was claimed by the bastard called Hugh Hammer.
            Hugh and Vermithor fought on Rhaenyra's side in the civil war for some time, but during its later stages Hugh decided to betray her. When a large Green army of House Hightower advanced towards King's Landing after a long journey up from the south, Rhaenyra sent an army with two dragons to counter it: Vermithor ridden by Hugh Hammer, and Silverwing ridden by Ulf the White. In the ensuing Sack of Tumbleton, however, both Hugh and Ulf switched sides and turned their dragons against Rhaenyra's own army.
            Luckily for Rhaenyra, rather than continue to advance on nearby King's Landing, Hugh and Ulf instead chose to drink and whore amid the ruins of Tumbleton with the Green army, unable to agree on what specific course of action to take next.[1]
            At the start of the Dance, Vermithor is stated to have been the largest living dragon after Vhagar herself, last of the first generation Targaryen dragons. Vermithor's scales were bronze with tan highlights, earning him the nickname "the Bronze fury".
            Vermithor was famously the mount of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, the Old King whose great and prosperous reign lasted 55 years. Jaehaerys I's sister-wife Queen Alysanne Targaryen was also a dragon-rider, and her mount was Silverwing. It has been speculated that there is some sort of magical/psychic or at least emotional bond between dragons and their riders, so that they like friends of their rider and scorn their enemies. In this case, Vermithor and Silverwing were actually a mated pair, mirroring the marriage between their two riders, and continued to remain so even after their original riders died. They "oft coiled about each other in the fields" when their armies weren't on the move during the Dance. Their matings may have produced some of the younger dragons at the time of the Dance.
            At one point Jaehaerys I rode Vermithor on a royal visit to Winterfell, along with Queen Alysanne riding Silverwing, and four other as-yet-unidentified dragons. On a whim, Alysanne rode further up to The Wall itself, and Jaehaerys I followed on Vermithor.
            The novels never give the lineage of any of the Targaryen dragons, though it is fairly clear that Vermithor was one of the powerful second-generation dragons hatched after the Targaryen Conquest. Vermithor was nearly 100 years old during the Dance, putting his hatching somewhere around the years when Aegon I died.
            Live-readings that George R.R. Martin has done of his more extensive private notes mention that towards the end of Aegon I's life, there were about half a dozen dragon hatchlings. When Aegon I died several localized rebellions sprang up against his weak older son Aenys Targaryen, but Maegor helped put them down riding Balerion. Following this, two new dragons hatched at the same time, which was taken as a good omen for relations between the two brothers in the future (which turned out to be false). These two hatchlings may have been Vermithor and Silverwing, given how they were always a pair (Vermithor ultimately grew larger than the previous half-dozen, such as Dreamfyre, but this may just be up to individual variation). This also matches the dates given: if Vermithor was one of the earlier half-dozen dragons he would have been slightly over 100 years old during the Dance.
            Vermithor was left riderless after Jaehaerys I's death, and had no other until he was claimed by Hugh Hammer 30 years later during the Dance. Of the six riderless dragons left on Dragonstone island, he was one of the three who were only semi-wild; compared to the other three who had grown to adulthood without riders at all. As a result, while Vermithor killed a few Dragonseeds who attempted to mount him, he was relatively accustomed to the presence of men and before too long accepted Hugh as his rider.
            Hugh rode Vermithor into combat during the great Battle of the Gullet. The Season 5 Histories &amp; Lore featurette recounts events in the wrong order, presenting it as if the loss of Vermax at the Gullet is what prompted Rhaenyra to look for dragonseeds to increase her number of war-capable dragons. In the prequel novellas, however, it was actually the loss of Meleys at the Siege of Rook's Rest which prompted this (the animated featurette greatly condensed this to only briefly mention the Battle of the Gullet in passing). Hugh then rode Vermithor during Rhaenyra's sudden seizure of King's Landing, though the defenseless city fell so quickly that he saw little if any combat.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Vermithor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascVermithor</string></dict>
        <key>Balerion</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.54.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Balerion, known as Balerion the Black Dread, was the dragon ridden by Aegon the Conqueror during the War of Conquest. He was so large it was said his shadow could swallow an entire town when Balerion took flight.[1][2]
            Balerion was employed by Aegon the Conqueror to burn and half-ruin Harrenhal. Balerion later participated, along with the other two Targaryen dragons, in the climactic battle of the War of Conquest: the Field of Fire.
            Balerion's skull is seen in the cellars of the Red Keep when Cersei and Qyburn visit. The skull is massive, especially when compared to Cersei and it is clearly larger that Drogon's head. They use the skull to test a new weapon designed to defend against Daenerys's dragons. It shoots an arrow that goes right through the skull.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Balerion was the last surviving dragon from Valyria. When the Targaryens resettled on Dragonstone to escape the coming Doom of Valyria, they took five dragons with them, but four of these later died, leaving only Balerion. However, the other dragons did leave behind eggs, from which hatched Meraxes and Vhagar.
            Aegon personally used Balerion to burn out Harrenhal. Balerion destroyed the castle all by himself, as the other two dragons were away fighting other campaigns. He then took part in the Field of Fire alongside Vhagar and Meraxes.
            After Aegon I died, Balerion bonded with his second son Maegor, known as "Maegor the Cruel". His first son Aenys succeeded Aegon upon his death, but Aenys had already bonded to the dragon Quicksilver. Maegor refused to attempt to bond with any dragon in his youth, intentionally waiting until his father died and Balerion was available for a new rider - feeling that he was worthy of nothing less than riding Balerion himself. Maegor made extensive use of Balerion during the eleven year long Faith Militant uprising, burning hundreds of members of the Faith Militant at King's Landing. He also participated in the major battle at the big fork of the Blackwater, albeit the rebels intentionally attacked during a heavy rainstorm so Balerion would have difficulty flying.
            Balerion lived to just over two centuries old. The Targaryens moved to Dragonstone with Balerion about a century before the Targaryen Conquest of Westeros, and Balerion is stated to have died almost a century after that, late in the reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. George R.R. Martin stated that Balerion died of old age, not from combat. Balerion's last rider was Jaehaerys I's grandson (and later successor), Viserys I, who did not bond with a new dragon after Balerion died. Jaehaerys I himself didn't ride Balerion, because he was bonded to Vermithor, who during the Dance of the Dragons was the oldest and largest dragon after Vhagar. It is unknown if Balerion had another rider in the number of years after Maegor died but before Viserys I rode him.[4]
            Balerion was the greatest Targaryen dragon who ever lived, the largest since the fall of Valyria. Dragons keep growing for their entire lives, meaning that Balerion was even larger during the Faith Militant uprising. Only Vhagar ever managed to approach Balerion in size, but only many years after his death. Vhagar was the youngest of the original three Targaryen dragons and therefore was not as large as the others. By the time of the civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons in 130 AL, however, Vhagar was approaching two hundred years in age, and had become nearly as large as Balerion during the War of Conquest. During the Dance, Vhagar's body core was said to be about five times larger than a war horse, meaning that Balerion was somewhat bigger than this. Balerion's skull was the largest in the collection of 19 dragon skulls that the Targaryens displayed in the Red Keep.
            Balerion apparently mated with both Vhagar and Meraxes, though the exact lineage of subsequent Targaryen dragons has not yet been directly stated.
            Balerion was colored black (hence his sobriquet of "The Black Dread"), with red highlights. Generations later, Daenerys Targaryen thinks that her newly hatched dragon Drogon resembles descriptions of Balerion so closely that he is actually a reincarnation of Balerion's spirit, though she gives him a new name for his new life.
            Rhaenys Targaryen had a black kitten she named "Balerion" after the mighty dragon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Balerion</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascBalerion</string></dict>
        <key>Viserion</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.55.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Viserion is a dragon that the Night King slayed and reanimated as a wight. He is one of the three dragons born in the Dothraki Sea, along with Drogon and Rhaegal, and is named after Daenerys Targaryen's elder brother, Viserys. Before becoming a wight, he can be distinguished by his cream and gold colored scales, and red-orange wings.
            Viserion (as a wight) is called an ice dragon by HBO's Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide,[1] but he is different from the ones of legend. He still breathes fire that is capable of melting the Wall, although it is blue in color.[2]
            Daenerys is given three dragons eggs by Magister Illyrio Mopatis on the occasion of her wedding to Khal Drogo.[3] She is drawn to these eggs and always keeps them in a chest with her. Viserys tries to steal them but is stopped by Ser Jorah Mormont.[4]
            Viserion is born along with his two siblings after Daenerys has their eggs placed on the funeral pyre erected for her deceased husband, Khal Drogo. As she rises unharmed from the ashes of the pyre on the morning following the funeral, he climbs on her leg.[5]
            Viserion is not shown as much, until he is stolen by Xaro Xhoan Daxos, along with Drogon and Rhaegal. When Daenerys enters the House of the Undying to retrieve them, she eventually finds her three dragons chained. Pyat Pree attempts to chain her with magic, claiming that her dragons make his magic strong, and that she makes them stronger; thus she will stay with them for an eternity. Daenerys whispers to her dragons, "dracarys," her command to breathe fire; the three of them proceed to burn Pyat Pree alive, releasing them from his magic.
            Viserion, along with his brothers, accompanies Daenerys on her journey from Astapor and Yunkai. When Daenerys has a meeting with a Razdal mo Eraz, of the Wise Masters of Yunkai, Viserion fights over a piece of meat with his brothers when Daenerys makes a show of force to intimidate Razdal.[6] After Daenerys frees the slaves of Yunkai, Viserion takes to the sky with his siblings at Daenerys's command; a show of both power and freedom.[7]
            Viserion is seen with his brother Rhaegal fighting over a dead lamb. Drogon, who is now visibly bigger than them, quickly takes the lamb as his brothers squeal for him to share. He sets the corpse down and the three begin to eat.[8]
            In response to Drogon's killing of a three-year old girl, Daenerys leads Viserion and Rhaegal into the catacombs of Meereen, where she chains them up.[9]
            Daenerys finally decides to reenter the catacombs in an attempt to regain control over her dragons. Rhaegal and Viserion, who have grown even larger during their time in captivity, immediately lash out and breathe fire at the sight of their mother who imprisoned them.[10]
            Some time later, Daenerys, reeling over the death of Ser Barristan Selmy, arrests the leaders of Meereen's great families and brings them to meet Rhaegal and Viserion. Rhaegal roasts one of nobles and tucks in, sharing the meal with Viserion. Her point proven, Daenerys leaves, sarcastically saying that she doesn't want to overfeed the dragons.[11]
            In the Great Pyramid, Tyrion Lannister learns that Rhaegal and Viserion have not been eating anything ever since their mother had left. He decides to free them, knowing that they will be better off that way.
            Accompanied by Varys, Tyrion ventures alone into the catacombs and encounters Rhaegal and Viserion for the first time. Despite their initial hostility towards him, Tyrion remains calm, assuring them he is a friend of Daenerys and only wants to help. He manages to earn their trust and unshackle them, all the while telling them the story of how he wanted a dragon for his nameday, only to be disappointed by uproarious laughter from his family and the cold truth from his father. Once free, the dragons immediately depart while Tyrion quickly exits the catacombs with Varys.[12]
            After Daenerys returns to Meereen and pits Drogon against the fleet assembled by Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis, Rhaegal and Viserion break out of the catacombs and join their mother and brother in destroying the the slavers' fleet with dragon fire, decisively breaking the Second Siege of Meereen. This defeat marks the end of the attempt to reintroduce slavery to Meereen.[13]
            Some time later, Viserion and his brothers accompany their mother and her large army on a voyage to retake Westeros by soaring above the armada.[14]
            Viserion and his brothers fly ahead to investigate Dragonstone while their mother proceeds there by boat.[15]
            Upon Jon Snow's arrival at Dragonstone, Drogon and Viserion fly overhead and visibly scare both him and Davos Seaworth. Tyrion then comments that he has not yet gotten used to them either.
            Later, Daenerys tells Jon that both Viserion and Rhaegal were named for her deceased brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar, respectively.[16]
            Viserion accompanies Daenerys, Rhaegal, and Drogon as they attempt to rescue Jon Snow from the White Walkers and the army of the dead at the Wight Hunt beyond the Wall. Viserion and his brothers burn and destroy many of the wights while Jon and his party mount Drogon with Daenerys. Not long after they arrive, however, the Night King is given a ice spear by another White Walker, and then hurls it at Viserion. The spear pierces the dragon's neck, fatally wounding him. With a screech of agony that mingles with his brothers' cries, the helpless dragon drops like a stone, crashing through the frozen lake and sinking beneath the water.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Viserion</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascViserion</string></dict>
        <key>Morghul</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.56.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Morghul was a dragon bred by House Targaryen.
            During the Dance of the Dragons, an angry mob of smallfolk stormed the Dragonpit where House Targaryen stabled their dragons. Morghul was among the five dragons killed.[1]
            in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Morghul was a young dragon bound to Princess Jaehaera Targaryen, daughter of King Aegon II Targaryen, before the Dance of the Dragons. Morghul was never ridden. Morghul died in the Storming of the Dragonpit when it was invaded by a half-crazed angry mob after a one-handed prophet called the Shepherd began to rant against all dragons everywhere. There is little doubt that Morghul killed scores of people before being slain.
            Shackled by heavy chains Morghul, it is written, was slain by a huge man who rushed headlong into the dragon's flame with spear in hand, thrusting its point repeatedly even as dragonflame melted the steel plate that encased him and devoured his flesh within. Since his real name was not known, the man became known as the Burning Knight when the tale spread.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Morghul</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenMascMorghul</string></dict>
