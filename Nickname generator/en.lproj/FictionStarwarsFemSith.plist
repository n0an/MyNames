            In 5107 BBY her son Tenebrae discovered that he was Force-sensitive. Her husband confronted her about Tenebrae's power, to which she admitted that she had an affair with the ruling Sith Lord. Her husband attacked her in a rage, and she was saved by her son, who snapped his "father's" neck with a mere thought. As punishment for being unfaithful and betraying her family, Tenebrae tortured her for months using the Force until he eventually killed her, while he honed his Force powers.
            Tenebrae's mother was first mentioned in Drew Karpyshyn's novel The Old Republic: Revan, which was released on November 15, 2011.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/ru/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C_%D0%A2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithFemTenebrae'smother</string></dict>

        <key>Darth Nyriss</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.5.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Nyriss was a female Pureblood Dark Lord of the Sith who sat on the Dark Council for more than twenty years (the third-longest tenure at the time).
            A female Sith Pureblood, Nyriss was an exceptionally powerful and ambitious woman. Darth Nyriss was one of the most talented and influential figures of the Sith Empire in her time. Perhaps her most notable accomplishments were the conquest of Drezzi, the destruction of Melldia, and gaining membership of the Empire's Dark Council on the basis of her talents. However, the Dark Council in her time was rife with internal power struggles and plotting. Nyriss, in particular, was subjected to several assassination attempts. Due to these occurrences, the Sith Emperor advised Nyriss to temporarily seclude herself from the Council's politics until the matter was resolved; she resided in a well-protected citadel on the western edge of Kaas City during this time. The Sith Emperor also suggested Nyriss to hire an agent who would be detached from the Council's politics and help her investigate the matter. However, Nyriss had plans of her own, which she put in to motion once a renowned warrior called Lord Scourge arrived in Dromund Kass to assist her.[1]
            By the time Nyriss met Scourge, her physical appearance had degenerated immensely as a result of the powerful dark side rituals that she chose to delve in; she was highly proficient in the arts of Sith sorcery and strong in the dark side of the Force. Nyriss was once very beautiful and could easily afford the procedures required to retain her youthful appearance but she chose not to, possibly to flaunt her strength in the dark side or that she didn't care about superficial appearances.[1]
            Nyriss's plans went beyond the elimination of her enemies who wanted her dead; she was among the co-conspirators on the Dark Council who planned to destroy the Sith Emperor. When Scourge found about this, he confronted Nyriss to ascertain her true motives. However, Nyriss still deemed his usefulness and revealed some terrible secrets of the Sith Emperor to Scourge to buy his allegiance. She even took Scourge to Nathema—former homeworld of the Sith Emperor—to prove her claims.[1]
            Nyriss was responsible for Revan's capture on Nathema and held him captive for several years in her stronghold, until the Jedi Master managed to turn Scourge against her on the basis of his talents and teachings. By this time, Scourge was not just ready to remove Nyriss from the picture but was also willing to help Revan in his plan to assassinate the Sith Emperor. As part of this plan, Scourge revealed Nyriss's treachery to the Sith Emperor, who then decided to eliminate all possible threats to him on urgent basis. Soon after, the Sith Emperor's forces attacked and seized Nyriss's stronghold.[1]
            As the battle ensued, Nyriss headed towards the prison cell where Revan was being held. Upon approaching the stairs which led to the prison cell, she noticed a droid called T3-M4 who raised alarm about her arrival. Nyriss unleashed a blast of power which sent T3-M4 tumbling down the stairs in response. Nyriss then saw two guards approaching her position whom she blasted with a powerful burst of purple lightning. The deadly bolts reduced those unfortunate guards to charred smoking husks in an instant. As Nyriss approached the cell of Revan, she noticed the presence of another powerful Jedi named Meetra Surik in the room along with Scourge. Nyriss questioned Scourge about his motives but upon receiving no response from him, she realized his betrayal, and attacked him and the Jedi simultaneously. Neither Scourge nor Surik could withstand the might of Nyriss. With combination of her impressive speed, skills with the lightsaber, and power of the dark side, Nyriss subdued both of her powerful opponents simultaneously.[1]
            Nyriss then paused to prepare for the killing blow as the air around her began to crackle and grow hot. While she gloated about her past accomplishments, Revan emerged from his cell, with his Jedi robe pulled over his head and his mask on his face. Nyriss unleashed a swirling storm of pure dark side energy to incinerate her opponents. Revan stretched out his hands, and absorbed the deadly power of the dark side. Revan mocked Nyriss and redirected her power back at her. Nyriss was engulfed by her own power and failed to prevent the deadly bolts from ripping her apart, reducing her into a pile of ash.[1]
            Darth Nyriss was a master of Force lightning and favored it heavily.
            Darth Nyriss was also an expert in Sith sorcery rituals making her an expert in the field.
            She was also capable of using Telekinesis, Force speed and force shield to protect herself from attacks. Nyriss proved exceptionally capable in combat subduing both Lord Scourge and Meetra Surik.
            Darth Nyriss used Juyo in lightsaber combat and carried a standard red-bladed lightsaber.
            Darth Nyriss was first introduced in the novel The Old Republic: Revan by Drew Karpyshyn. In the 2012 reference guide The Essential Reader's Companion, Darth Nyriss' name is consistently misspelled Darth Nyris.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/ru/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82_%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithFemDarthNyriss</string></dict>

        <key>Exal Kressh</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.1.7.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Exal Kressh was a Sith female who was apprenticed to the Sith Emperor of the resurgent Sith Empire during the early years of the Great Galactic War. A descendant of the Sith Lord Ludo Kressh, Exal betrayed her Master when she learned of his plan to create "Children" who were connected to his will. She gave intelligence on Imperial fleet movements to the forces of the Galactic Republic, so they could plan an attack on the planet Korriban.
            When she was confronted by Sith apprentice Teneb Kel on a space station near the planet Lenico IV, Kressh sabotaged the station and escaped, resulting in the colony's destruction. Kressh made her way to Korriban so she could raze the Sith Academy and halt the Sith Emperor's project during the Republic's assault on the planet. However, she was defeated by Kel at the Academy.
            Exal Kressh was selected to be the Sith Emperor's apprentice, a role in which she served until the early years of the Great Galactic War, when she discovered he intended to hollow her mind out and fill it with his own, making her the first of his "Children." In response, Exal abandoned her duties in the Kathol Rift and fled toward the fringes of Republic Space, and possibly sending information to the Republic. The Emperor and the Dark Council responded by assigning the Sith apprentice Teneb Kel to hunt her down and kill her. Kressh destroyed Lenico Colony Blue while fighting against Teneb. Teneb barely survived the duel, but was able to escape from the colony and continue his mission to find her.
            Kressh attempted to destroy the Emperor's project to make his children by assisting the Republic on an assault on Korriban. Secretly helping the Republic, she intended to sabotage the planet's defenses to allow the Republic to infiltrate the planet. She was met again by Teneb Kel, though she once again held the upper hand against him in combat. However, when Teneb's warrior slave Maggot intervened, Teneb took his chance by killing Kressh, therefore preventing her from sabotaging the planet's defenses or destroying the Emperor's project. She finally came to the point that her arrogance and superiority undermined her when Teneb used the Force to bring a fallen Sith's lightsaber to stab her from behind.
            Before dying, she heard the Emperor's voice in her head one last time, giving words of mockery, "You are nothing", the voice said, then she fell to the floor.
            As the Emperor's apprentice, Exal Kressh at first believed she was special when the Emperor took her under his tutelage. This fact gave her a severe superiority complex, which she expressed during her duels with Teneb Kel.[1][3] Kressh was supremely proud of her Sith heritage. She believed it was her right and privilege by blood to become the Emperor's apprentice and heir. However, after the Emperor attempted to make her his slave instead of his heir, she felt betrayed by her Master.[3] Her hatred towards the Emperor was such that she was willing to give vital Imperial information to the Jedi and the Republic that would potentially undermine the Empire's campaign in the Great Galactic War.[2]
            Still, even though she left the Emperor's side, Kressh was constantly tormented by the persistent taunts and commands he projected into her mind, which was gradually driving her mad.[3] However, even though she resisted the Emperor's presence in her consciousness, she felt invincible just because the Emperor hollowed her out and filled her with his strength, believing she could defeat any agents the Dark Council sent after her. Unfortunately, it was her arrogance and superiority complex that caused her to underestimate her enemies, which led to her death at the hands of Teneb Kel.[1]
            Exal Kressh was a member of the Kressh bloodline, strong in the Force, and was trained in the ways of the dark side by Vitiate. She was remarkably skilled in martial aspects of combat as she was able to kill numerous Sith on Korriban and outmaneuver Teneb Kel. Her attacking strategies involved leaping at the opponents with ferocious two-handed strikes and attacking their flanks with one-handed thrusts.[1]
            Kressh was proficient in the use of Force lightning, using it to obliterate Teneb Kel's lightsaber and incapacitating Qawohl. She was also proficient in the use of the protection bubble, utilizing this talent to defend herself from countless shards of crystalline permaglass thrown at her by Teneb Kel. Furthermore, she was proficient in the use of telekinesis, using these powers to overwhelm multiple opponents,[2] destroy the space station known as Lenico Colony Blue,[3] disintegrate a large stone column of the Sith Academy on Korriban,[1] and immobilize Teneb Kel.[1]
            Kressh shared a powerful bond with Vitiate, evidenced by the frequent telepathic taunts and commands he sent into her mind.[3] Kressh also appeared to have an extremely high tolerance to physical pain; this was demonstrated when Qawohl shot her twice and she was still battle-capable.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/ru/wiki/%D0%AD%D0%BA%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BB_%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%88</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsSithFemExalKressh</string></dict>
