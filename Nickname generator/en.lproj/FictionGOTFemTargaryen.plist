        <key>Missandei</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.1.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Missandei was originally a slave who served as an interpreter to the masters of Astapor, until she was freed when Daenerys Targaryen took the Unsullied army and used it to overthrow the slavers. Missandei now serves Daenerys as her trusted advisor and Handmaiden. After Daenerys flees Meereen on the back of her dragon Drogon, Missandei remains in the city as part of her Small Council along with Tyrion Lannister and Grey Worm while Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis search for the missing queen.
            When Daenerys returns to Meereen, with a horde of Dothraki, she achieves peace by ending the war over the Liberation of Slaver's Bay, which is later renamed the Bay of Dragons. Missandei then sails with Daenerys in order to reclaim the Iron Throne.
            Missandei was born on the island of Naath in the Summer Sea, off the coast of the continent of Sothoryos. She was enslaved at a young age and taken to Slaver's Bay in Essos, where she was eventually put to work as an interpreter for the slaver-master Kraznys mo Nakloz, one of the Good Masters of Astapor.
            Missandei speaks nineteen languages including High Valyrian (her favorite), the Low Valyrian dialect of Slaver's Bay, Dothraki, the Common Tongue of Westeros,[1] and has some knowledge of the functionally dead language of the Ghiscari Empire.[2]
            Missandei acts as an interpreter between her master Kraznys mo Nakloz and Daenerys Targaryen when she lands on Astapor with the intent to buy Unsullied. She does not simply translate, but offers Kraznys commentary on Daenerys's words and diplomatically leaves out Kraznys's insults to the Khaleesi.[3]
            Daenerys meets with Kraznys and other Good Masters and announces her intention to buy all of the eight thousand Unsullied for sale, but Kraznys says she cannot afford them. The slaver grows increasingly insulting and condescending - which makes Missandei struggle to interpret politely. Daenerys then adds she also wants to buy the hundreds of young men still in training. In exchange she offers one of her dragons. The Good Masters agree, but Daenerys also asks for Missandei as a gift and a show of good faith for the upcoming transaction. He agrees, and Missandei follows Daenerys.
            Daenerys asks the young slave for her name and if she has any living family, but she says she does not. Daenerys warns her that she is heading into war and she may be killed or may fall sick and die, to which Missandei simply recites the Valyrian aphorism: "Valar morghulis". Daenerys responds by correctly interpreting, "all men must die" but also adds that "we are not men", making Missandei grin.[4]
            Missandei, sporting a new dress to match Daenerys's outfit, is present when Kraznys and Daenerys conduct their exchange. She interprets their exchange until Daenerys fluidly begins issuing orders to the Unsullied in perfectly accented Low Valyrian, at which Missandei stares in shock. Missandei survives the subsequent sack of Astapor and marches out of the city with Daenerys.[5]
            Missandei serves as Daenerys's primary aide-de-camp during the march to Yunkai. On her queen's orders, she gathers the Unsullied officers together and orders them to select a single leader from among themselves. When the new leader, Grey Worm, is presented, Missandei explains that all Unsullied are given names consisting of drab colors and vermin to remind them of their station. Daenerys promptly orders the Unsullied to select their own names, though Grey Worm elects to keep his.[6]
            Missandei later attends to Daenerys and her guests Mero, Prendahl na Ghezn and Daario Naharis. Mero is rather uncouth throughout the whole event, groping Missandei and even trying smell her. In part because of his treatment of Missandei, the khaleesi orders that Mero be killed first if the Unsullied must fight the Second Sons. That night, as Daenerys bathes, she is surprised to learn that Missandei speaks no fewer than nineteen languages. Missandei says this shouldn't be that odd, since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of Dothraki. The khaleesi bristles at the idea she speaks only reasonable Dothraki and switches to the language to teach Missandei a lesson, only to have her pronunciation corrected. Suddenly, an Unsullied enters and hold a knife to Missandei's throat, advising the women not to scream. He removes his helmet, revealing himself as Daario. He explains he is here to kill Daenerys on orders from his captains, but they ran into a philosophical disagreement over her beauty. He then releases Missandei and produces his captains' severed heads.[1]
            Missandei is later on hand as Daenerys waits for word of the infiltration of Yunkai[7] and when Yunkai's gates open. She at first recites a prepared speech on how Daenerys has freed the slaves, but the khaleesi interrupts with a speech of her own. When the freed slaves begin calling Daenerys "mhysa", Missandei explains the word's Ghiscari origins and its meaning, "mother".[8]
            At the gates of Meereen, Missandei interprets the words of Meereen's champion to Daenerys. She is clearly reluctant to accurately interpret the Meereenese Valyrian and cleans up the language slightly when relaying the message. A few minutes later, when Daario is selected as the champion, Missandei makes complimentary remarks about him, which Daenerys brushes off.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Missandei</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemMissandei</string></dict>
        <key>Shiera Seastar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.2.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shiera Seastar was one of the infamous Great Bastards of King Aegon IV Targaryen, also known as "Aegon the Unworthy".
            Shiera was one of the infamous Great Bastards of King Aegon IV Targaryen, also known as "Aegon the Unworthy".
            Shiera, along with her siblings is mentioned in the House Targaryen entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, while King Aegon IV had many bastard children, the mothers of four of them were also noblewomen, which encouraged him to formally acknowledge them. The four Great Bastards were Daemon Blackfyre (whose mother, secretly, was Daena Targaryen), Aegor "Bittersteel" Rivers (whose mother was a member of House Bracken), Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers (whose mother was a member of House Blackwood), and Shiera Seastar (whose mother was Serenei of Lys, from an ancient Valyrian noble family).
            Shiera was the last of the Great Bastards, the daughter of Aegon IV's ninth and final mistress, Serenei of Lys, who died giving birth to her. Serenei had belonged to an ancient but impoverished Valyrian noble family of Lys. There were rumors that Serenei practiced black magic, that she was far older than she claimed to be but bathed in blood to maintain her appearance of youth. Many thought that Serenei had passed these powers on to her daughter, and that Shiera also practiced black magic. Certainly, Shiera was considered to be one of (if not the) most beautiful women of her generation, and a famous seductress. She had long silver-gold Targaryen hair, and wore stunning cloth-of-silver dresses. She was very well read, spoke many languages, and kept an extensive library (which, according to the rumors, contained books on black magic). Shiera's eyes had two mismatched colors, one blue and the other green, but it was believed that this only enhanced her beauty. She wore a silver necklace with alternating sapphires and emeralds to compliment her exotic eyes. Her mother named her "Shiera", which literally means "Star of the Sea" (in a language the text doesn't identify). Dozens of men fought duels to the death for her affection, poets competed to praise her beauty, but she spurned them all and never married. She did take many lovers throughout her life, however, including Brynden Rivers.
            On his deathbed, Aegon IV foolishly had all of the Great Bastards legitimized, which led to strife between them and his legitimate heir King Daeron II, tensions which ultimately split realm apart in the devastating civil war known as the Blackfyre Rebellion. Bloodraven sided with their half-brother King Daeron II Targaryen, while his other half-brother, Bittersteel sided with his half-brother Daemon Blackfyre.
            Bittersteel and Bloodraven hated each other, because they both competed for the love of their half-sister Shiera Seastar. Bloodraven asked her to marry him dozens of times and she refused, but she did let him into her bed on occasion. Shiera, however, completely rejected Bittersteel, and for this he never forgave Bloodraven. It also didn't help that Bittersteel's mother was a Bracken and Bloodraven's mother was a Blackwood, as those two noble families had been feuding for thousands of years. Bittersteel became a great champion and general for the Blackfyres, while Bloodraven became a great champion and general for the Targaryens.
            Shiera's activities during the Blackfyre Rebellions are not detailed, beyond implying that she sided with the legitimate Targaryens and not the Blackfyres. She is vaguely mentioned as assisting Bloodraven in his work as Master of Whisperers. Shier​a's fate has never been mentioned either.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Shiera_Seastar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemShieraSeastar</string></dict>
        <key>Elaena Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.3.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elaena Targaryen was a Princess of the Targaryen dynasty and a sister of Baelor the Blessed, who imprisoned her along their sisters Daena and Rhaena at the Maidenvault to prevent carnal temptations.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Elaena was the third daughter of King Aegon III. She's described as being not as pretty as her sisters, but her beauty matured as she got older. Her eyes were soft lilac and her hair was platinum-white with a gold streak down the middle, which she wore long, pulled back and in a braid. She liked to dress in black, like her father. Elaena was eleven when she was confined along with her sisters and cut off her hair in protest, wearing it short for a while.
            She married three times, twice at a king's behest and once for passion, and gave birth to seven children. She then declared that if seven was sufficient for the Gods, it would do for her as well. Although she had three husbands during her lifetime, the great love of her life was her cousin, Lord Alyn Velaryon, the Oakenfist, with whom she had two bastard children, Jon and Jeyne Waters. Oakenfist was lost at sea while she was pregnant with their twins. She was then made to enter into her first marriage to old Lord Ossifer Plumm, who died on their wedding night. Elaena became pregnant around the same time and gave birth to Viserys Plumm - many suspected that he was really a bastard, but none openly challenged her claim that he was Ossifer's. She was then made to marry Lord Ronnel of House Penrose, by whom she had four trueborn children. Penrose was Master of Coin at the time for Elaena's cousin, King Daeron II, but it was something of an open secret that Elaena was the true financial mastermind of the Iron Throne, Master of Coin in all but name, and her husband simply added his seal to letters she wrote. After he died she married once more, this time for love, to Lord Manwoody, though true to her word she had no more children.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Elaena_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemElaenaTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Aelinor Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.4.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Aelinor Targaryen was both the wife and sister of King Aerys I.
            Aelinor Targaryen was both the wife and sister of King Aerys I.
            Aelinor is mentioned in the House Targaryen's entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aelinor is not mentioned precisely as Aerys I's sister-wife, though it was assumed by fandom she was a Targaryen due to the custom of dynastic incest. The prop of the Lineages book that Eddard reads in Season 1 of the TV series (written by Bryan Cogman) also made this assumpetion.
            In The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook, however, it is revealed that she was actually a member of House Penrose, a noble house from the Stormlands, as well as a cousin to House Targaryen. This information was only released in 2014, after Season 1. So far there has been no official update to her status in the TV continuity.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Aelinor_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemAelinorTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Helaena Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.5.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Helaena Targaryen was a Queen Consort of the House Targaryen dynasty.
            Helaena Targaryen was the daughter of Viserys I Targaryen and his second wife Alicent Hightower, and the sister of the future Aegon II Targaryen and Aemond Targaryen. She was also the half-sister of Rhaenyra Targaryen from her father's first marriage to Aemma Arryn. At some point, she became the wife of her eldest brother (which was common for the Targaryens in order to keep bloodlines "pure"). When her father was on his deathbed, he announced that his eldest child Rhaenyra would be Queen. However, Alicent firmly disagreed and proclaimed Aegon as King. This therefore lead to Helaena becoming Queen Consort of the Seven Kingdoms. This later lead to a rebellion between her half-sister and her eldest brother/husband that would be known as the Dance of the Dragons, in which Aegon would set up loyalists to the crown known as the Greens, whilst Rhaenyra set up a rebellious faction known as the Blacks. She gave birth to three of Aegon's children Jaehaerys, Jaehaera and Maelor. During the rebellion, Daemon Targaryen hired two murderers, known as Blood and Cheese, to avenge the death of Rhaenyra's son, Lucerys Velaryon. One was a former Gold Cloak and the other was a rat catcher from Flea Bottom who knew every part of Maegor's holdfast. After breaking into the Red Keep, they demanded that Helaena choose which of her sons she would rather have dead, at the very minute she was putting her sons and daughter to bed. Whilst her sons were at knife-point, Helaena begged that they kill her instead, but Blood and Cheese refused. Faced with this ultimatum, Helaena named her youngest son Maelor as the victim of the assassins. Some believed that this was because he was too young to understand, but others believed that is was due to Jaehaerys being the heir to Aegon's throne. Cheese then told Maelor that he was unwanted by his mother. However, Blood then struck off the head of Jaehaerys with a single blow. By the time that the guards came to the bedroom, they found Helaena screaming, driven mad by grief, still clasping her child's corpse. This therefore made the war take a drastic turn, making it become an annihilation of bloodshed on Aegon's part. When Rhaenyra came to King's Landing on the back of her dragon, the Small Council surrendered Alicent and Helaena. After Rhaenyra finally took the throne from Aegon, resulting in his disappearance of him, Helaena flung her from the Red Keep, and was impaled on iron spikes that lined the moat. Her brother/husband would later regain his kingship, but her nephew Aegon would later become King, due to the deaths of all her children.[1]
            
            In 109 AC, Helaena was born to King Viserys I Targaryen and his second wife, Queen Alicent Hightower. She had an older half-sister, Rhaenyra, and an older brother, Aegon, and would have two younger brothers, Aemond and Daeron.
            By the age of twelve, Helaena had become a dragonrider, and rode the dragon Dreamfyre. In 122 AC, at the age of thirteen, Helaena was married to her older brother Aegon, following the ancient tradition of House Targaryen. Barely a year after her wedding, Helaena gave birth to twins: Jaehaerys and Jaehaera.
            On the first day of 127 AC, Helaena's father, King Viserys I, held a feast to celebrate the recovery of his health. According to the court fool Mushroom, after the king had left the feast, Helaena's nephew, Prince Jacaerys Velaryon, asked her for a dance, which her husband and brother, Aegon, took offense to. Later that same year, Helaena gave birth to a third child, a boy named Maelor.
            On the third day of the third month of 129 AC, Helaena brought her three children to her father's chambers, where the king, the night before his death, entertained her children with stories about King Jaehaerys I Targaryen.
            With the death of King Viserys I Targaryen, a war for succession began. Helaena was informed of her father's passing a day after his death was discovered. When the decision was made to crown her husband, Prince Aegon, instead of Viserys's appointed heir, Princess Rhaenyra, Helaena became a Queen. On the day of the coronation, it was Helaena's mother Alicent who placed the crown upon Helaena's head.
            Unwilling to accept Aegon as her King, Helaena's half-sister Rhaenyra was crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms on Dragonstone. While she declared Otto Hightower, Helaena's grandfather, and Dowager Queen Alicent to be traitors, Rhaenyra expressed willingness to forgive Helaena and her siblings, as long as they came to Dragonstone and swore fealthy to her.
            When Grand Maester Orwyle suggested traveling to Dragonstone to make Rhaenyra give up her claim, Helaena spoke in favor of his plan, together with her mother, after which King Aegon II Targaryen reluctantly agreed to send the Grand Maester.
            Helaena and her three young children, Jaehaera (left), Maelor(middle) and Jaehaerys (right) are surprised by Cheese and Blood.
            Helaena was accustomed to bring her children by her mother's chambers in the Tower of the Hand every night before they were put to bed. The two men Prince Daemon Targaryen, Rhaenyra's husband, had hired to murder one of Helaena's sons, were aware of this fact. Thus these two men, known as Blood and Cheese, hid in Alicent's chambers, bound and gagged Alicent, and murdered her bedmaid. There, they awaited Helaena's arrival. They took Helaena and her children hostage, and forced Helaena to choose which one of her sons would die. Helaena offered herself, but was refused. Threatening to have Blood rape Jaehaera, and to kill all three of her children should she refuse, the two men forced Helaena to make a decision. In the end, Helaena reluctantly named her youngest child, Maelor, who was deemed to be to young to understand what was happening. In response, the two men killed Prince Jaehaerys, and fled with his head. Helaena became depressed and slowly sank into madness after Jaehaerys's death, and refused to eat, bathe, or leave her chambers. Nor would she look at her younger son, Maelor, anymore, knowing that she had chosen him to die.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Helaena_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemHelaenaTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Rhaenys Targaryen </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.6.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rhaenys Targaryen was the granddaughter of Jaehaerys I Targaryen, and the sister of Viserys I Targaryen and Daemon Targaryen. Her father died at some point, predeceasing her grandfather. Upon her grandfather's death, her brother Viserys I Targaryen ascended the throne. She later married Corlys Velaryon, and the two had at least one son, Laenor Velaryon, who would later marry Rhaenys's niece Rhaenyra Targaryen. Because the Lord of Driftmark is sworn to the Princess of Dragonstone, and the fact that their son was married to her, Corlys and Rhaenys presumably lived on Dragonstone. Rhaenyra would give Rhaenys three grandsons: Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey. When Laenor died, Rhaenyra married her uncle and Rhaenys's brother Daemon and had two more sons by him, Aegon and Viserys.
            When her father Viserys died, Rhaenyra was expected to ascend the Iron Throne, since her father did not change the succession when he had a son. However, Aegon II Targaryen was crowned King in the Dragonpit, at bequest of Rhaenys' sister-in-law Alicent Hightower. The war between brother and sister would be known as the Dance of the Dragons. With Aegon's own Small Council in King's Landing, Rhaenys sat on Rhaenyra's, along with her husband, who was Hand of the Queen.
            When Rook's Rest was attacked by Ser Criston Cole and the Greens, as Aegon II's supporters were called, Rhaenyra sent her aunt to burn the army and save the fort. Mounted on her dragon, Meleys, Rhaenys unexpectedly turned up at Rook's Rest and laid waste to the army, incinerating them, which she enjoyed. However, Rhaenys was flying into a trap. Her nephew Aemond Targaryen confronted her on his monstrous dragon Vhagar, the last of the original three Targaryen dragons along with the King himself, on his magnificent dragon Sunfyre. Despite being outnumbered, Rhaenys didn't flee. Meleys's flame faced Vhagar's and Sunfyre's, until it looked like that there was a second sun in the sky. By the time the fight was over, Aemond and Vhagar were the only ones uninjured, whilst Aegon had to have a constant dose of Milk of the poppy to survive and Sunfrye (who lay on top of Aegon) was wounded, and a wing almost completely torn off. It was crippled and would never fly again. Meleys had been to "torn to shreds" and Rhaenys was just ash and bone.[1]
            
            Princess Rhaenys was the daughter of Jocelyn Baratheon and Prince Aemon Targaryen, making her a cousin rather than sister to Viserys I. Rhaenys and the late Lord Boremund Baratheon had always been the staunchest of friends.
            After the death of Prince Aemon in 92 AC, the Old King, Jaehaerys I Targaryen, chose his next son Baelon rather than Rhaenys as his heir.
            The annals of the Great Council of 101 after Baelon's death record that the lords assembled had favored the male claimant, Viserys, Baelon's son, over the female - one of which was Rhaenys - by twenty to one, but there had been dissenters.
            House Baratheon had always been a staunch supporter of the claims of Princess Rhaenys and her children. The Starks of Winterfell had spoken for Rhaenys at Harrenhal, as had Lord Stark's bannermen, House Dustin of Barrowton and House Manderly of White Harbour.
            Princess Rhaenys sat on the black council of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen. When the Velaryon fleet closed off the Gullet, sailing forth from Dragonstone and Driftmark to block all shipping for Blackwater Bay, the black council's plan was for Rhaenys to fly overhead to keep their foes from attacking their ships with dragons.
            Nine days after Lord Staunton dispatched a plea for help, the dragon Meleys appeared above Rook's Rest. On her back, in steel and copper armor that flashed in the sun, rode Rhaenys Targaryen.
            As Rhaenys attacked the soldiers of Ser Criston Cole, King Aegon II Targaryen upon Sunfyre and Prince Aemond Targaryen upon Vhagar appeared in the skies. Criston had sprung a trap and Rhaenys had snatched the bait.
            Princess Rhaenys made no attempt to flee, turning Meleys toward the foe. Against Vhagar alone, Meleys may have won but she stood little chance against both dragons. The dragons met violently a thousand feet above the ground and all three beasts went spinning to the earth. From the ashes, only Vhagar rose unharmed. A body believed to be Rhaenys Targaryen was later found beside the carcass of her dragon, but so blackened no one could be sure it was her.

        <key>Rhaenyra Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.7.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen was a Queen of the Targaryen dynasty.
            Rhaenyra was a Queen of the Targaryen dynasty. She was the daughter of King Viserys I, and elder half-sister of King Aegon II, Queen Helaena, and Prince Aemond Targaryen. She was the mother of five sons, three by her first husband, Laenor Velaryon,  who was also her cousin - Jacaerys Velaryon, Lucerys Velaryon, and Joffrey Velaryon. She later married her uncle, Daemon Targaryen, and two more sons, the future Kings Aegon III and Viserys II. Aegon III was himself the father of Kings Daeron I and Baelor, and Viserys II was the father of Aegon IV. Viserys I, having no sons by his first wife, Aemma Arryn, named Rhaenyra his heir, trained her how to rule and made the Lords of Westeros swear oaths to recognize her as his successor. However, he later remarried and had a son, Aegon. His death sparked a civil war between the half-siblings known as the Dance of Dragons.
            Based on the island of Dragonstone, Rhaenyra challenged Aegon's coronation, supported by her sons, husband, and the few Lords who had taken her side. Although greatly outnumbered, Rhaenyra had a powerful fleet and a large number of dragons at her disposal. Briefly ousting Aegon from King's Landing and crowning herself Rhaenyra I, she managed to take control of the North, the Riverlands and the Vale, but her support gradually eroded and her husband, as well as most of her children and dragons, were killed in battle. She eventually was defeated and Aegon II had his dragon devour her. However, her surviving son wedded Aegon's daughter and succeeded him as Aegon III.[1]
            Touring the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing, King Joffrey Baratheon explains to Margaery Tyrell the fate of Rhaenyra Targaryen. Joffrey points out the crypts where what little is left of her is kept.[2]
            At her father's army camp in the North, Princess Shireen Baratheon reads a history book about the civil war between Aegon II and Rhaenyra: The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling by Grand Maester Munkun. When her father Stannis and  Davos Seaworth ask about it, she explains that the conflict between Rhaenyra and Aegon II split the Seven Kingdoms in half. Shireen also specifies that Aegon was Rhaenyra's half-brother.[3]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Rhaenyra was the daughter of King Viserys I, and his only child to survive the cradle by his first wife, Aemma of House Arryn (who died after giving birth to Prince Baelon Targaryen. Aemma died during the birth, and her son died a day later). Due to the lack of a male heir, Viserys designated Rhaenyra as his successor. Therefore, Rhaenyra was the only female Targaryen  to lay claim to the Iron Throne in her own right. Since she was raised as the designated heir, Rhaenyra became quite pampered and arrogant, but also gained practical governmental experience.
            After Rhaenyra's mother died, her father remarried and had several sons by his second wife, Alicent of House Hightower. Even so, Viserys still publicly expected his daughter to succeed him, and when he died, his official will even stated so. However, Rhaenyra's younger half-brother, Aegon, challenged her claim. He stated that the normal inheritance laws of the Andals (which formed the basis of the unified law code in Westeros) called for male-preference primogeniture, meaning that a younger son would rightfully inherit before an older daughter. Rhaenyra had been raised as the heir apparent for years and commanded the loyalty of an inner circle of noble families very close to the crown. In defiance, her half-brother had himself crowned in King's Landing as Aegon II, and rallied to his side those noble Houses who did not enjoy royal favor during the reign of their father.
            This began a devastating civil war that tore apart the Seven Kingdoms,  known as The Dance of the Dragons, as it was the only war in which both sides had dragonriders. The war lasted for three years, and by the time it came to an end nearly all of the Targaryen dragons had been killed. The conflict also resulted in the death of three of Rhaenyra's five sons, as well as the eldest son of Aegon II.
            Aegon II held many advantages in the war, including control of the capital city, the support of the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and the approval of the High Septon. Rhaenyra's faction was based at Dragonstone, and to her advantage she had a larger number of dragons under her control - twelve to Aegon's four - though three of these were "wild" dragons and as-yet untamed, while another three were immature. She also did not have enough Targaryen blood relatives on her side to ride all of them, and a dragon will (typically) only bond with someone possessing the blood of Old Valyria. Thus a search was launched to find any surviving Targaryen bastards - nicknamed the "dragonseeds" - and enlist them in Rhaenyra's cause.
            The two factions during the war - one supporting Aegon and the other supporting Rhaenyra - became known as the "Blacks" and the "Greens" because of an incident that took place at a tournament some years before the war began.  Aegon II's mother Queen Alicent had worn a green dress to the tournament while Rhaenyra wore a black dress. Generally, Rhaenyra was supported by noble families who had enjoyed royal favor during her father's reign and possessed strong ties to the crown, while Aegon II rallied those who had been out of favor. Viserys I had signed charters with many powerful Houses in which they swore to accept Rhaenyra as his heir, but at least some of them broke their word after Viserys died. Rhaenyra sent her eldest son Jacaerys north on his dragon to visit the Eyrie and then Winterfell. At that time, the Vale was ruled by a female heiress who had inherited in her own right due to a lack of male heirs, and given that the entire civil war questioned a woman's right to rule, she and Rhaenrya were natural allies. Moreover, the Arryns had enjoyed royal favor earlier in Viserys I's reign since his first wife - Rhaenyra's own mother - was an Arryn, thus binding the two families by blood.The Starks came into the war on Rhaenyra's side in accordance with the original agreements they had made with Viserys. Rhaenyra's second son Lucerys flew on his dragon to Storm's End to gain an alliance with House Baratheon, but Aegon II's brother Aemond flew to Storm's End at the same time to pursue the same goal, riding the older dragon Vhagar. The results were decidedly mixed, and Storm's End subsequently supported Aegon II. The Westerlands also sided with Aegon II because he had appointed Tyland Lannister as his new Master of Coin. The Hightowers were of course staunch supporters of Aegon II, and so apparently was much of the Reach. Dorne had not been incorporated into the realm yet, and as they have often done throughout history, the Iron Islands remained neutral while the mainlanders slaughtered each other.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaenyra_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemRhaenyraTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Rhaena Targaryen </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.8.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rhaena Targaryen was a Princess of the Targaryen dynasty and a sister of Baelor the Blessed.
            Rhaena Targaryen was a Princess of the Targaryen dynasty and a sister of Baelor the Blessed, who imprisoned her along their sisters Daena and Elaena at the Maidenvault to prevent carnal temptations.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Rhaena was the second daughter of King Aegon III. She's described as a feminine beauty, soft and sweet, more rounded than her two sisters. She loved lace and gold trim and often embroidered depictions of faith on her clothing. She had silver-gold hair, more gold than silver. Unlike Daena and Elaena, she never chaffed at their confinement. She was heavily influenced by her brother, eventually becoming a septa of the Faith of the Seven.
            Aegon III's daughter Rhaena was actually at least the third member of House Targaryen to bear that name, because names often repeat in dynasties. The other two Rhaenas have not yet been introduced into the TV continuity. The first Rhaena was a sister of Jaehaerys I, who was forced to marry her half-uncle Maegor the Cruel after he killed her current husband (her brother Aegon). The second Rhaena was Aegon III's own half-sister, called "Rhaena of Pentos". They both shared the same father, Daemon Targaryen, but had different mothers.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaena_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemRhaenaTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Rhaella Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.9.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Rhaella Targaryen was the daughter of King Aegon V Targaryen and the sister wife of King Aerys II Targaryen. She is the mother of Rhaegar, Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen.
            Rhaella Targaryen was the daughter of King Aegon V Targaryen and the sister wife of King Aerys II Targaryen. They had three children: Rhaegar, Viserys and Daenerys.[1]
            She was unhappily married to her brother Aerys. It is said that one time when Jaime Lannister was on guard at their door he was forced to listen to Aerys rape Rhaella and was unable to do anything to stop it, while the other Kingsguard refused to intervene.[2]
            After the death of Rhaegar in the Battle of the Trident, Rhaella and Prince Viserys fled to the Targaryen ancestral seat of Dragonstone. Aerys would perish during the Sack of King's Landing, while Rhaella died giving birth to Daenerys during a great storm. After her death the children were taken across the Narrow Sea by loyalists to live in exile in the Free Cities.[3][4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Rhaella is the wife and sister of Aerys II and the mother of Rhaegar, Viserys, and Daenerys.
            Rhaella in her youth fell in love with a young knight from the Stormlands (his name is not mentioned by Barristan Selmy - he is presumed to be Ser Bonifer Hasty), who wore her favor in a tourney and named her queen of love and beauty. Their love was hopeless, as they both knew, since a landed knight is no fit consort for a princess of royal blood. After Rhaella's marriage to Aerys, Bonifer put away his lance and eventually became very pious. People heard him say that only the Maiden could replace Queen Rhaella in his heart. Ser Bonifer is still alive during the War of the Five Kings, and though old is still capable of combat. He and his men initially marched with Renly, but after his death switched over to Stannis, and took part in the Battle of the Blackwater. At the end of the battle he surrendered and knelt before King Joffrey, who pardoned him. Later he is given the office of castellan of Harrenhal. The alleged curse that struck all the former governors of the ill-fated castle does not worry him.
            Aerys had married Rhaella partly out of duty, since he had lusted after Joanna Lannister. The siblings apparently loathed each other and their marriage was loveless, becoming violent and abusive towards the end.
            According to Jaime, Aerys and Rhaella used to avoid each other most of the time - except when Aerys had someone burnt to death. The Mad King would become aroused by immolating his enemies, then he would pay a visit to Rhaella and molest her in extremely brutal manner. At one of those occasions, Jaime and Jon Darry stood at guard outside the queen's bedchamber, and heard her cry helplessly "You're hurting me!" A young and idealistic seventeen year old, Jaime was horrified by the sounds of marital rape which came through the door. Frightened, Jaime implored Ser Darry - a veteran member of the Kingsguard and a man he had revered for years - that "We are sworn to protect her as well." Darry answered, "We are, but not from him," and prevented Jaime from intervening. According to the queen's maids, on the next morning she looked as if some beast had savaged her, clawing at her thighs and chewing on her breasts. This vicious assault increased the loathing Jaime had already felt toward Aerys ever since the execution of Rickard Stark and his son. Ever since, Jaime has been disgusted by sexual assaults against women, explaining why he went out of his way to save Brienne of Tarth from being raped when they were captured.
            Rhaella was apparently a good mother to Rhaegar and Viserys. Viserys always told Daenerys that the stories saying their father was insane and "the Mad King" were nothing but lies spread by the Usurper (Robert Baratheon) and his followers. When she asks Barristan about this, he says that Viserys wasn't lying, though he was misinformed. Barristan explains that Rhaella always tried to hide the worst of Aerys's behavior from their children, not wanting to frighten them. Aerys may not have been as unstable earlier in his life when Rhaegar was born, but by the time Viserys was a young boy it took Rhaella's active intervention to keep him from seeing Aerys at his worst. Rhaegar, meanwhile, grew into an adult and gradually realized that his father was going insane, but hoped to quietly wait out the rest of his reign without major incident.
            Both Joanna Lannister and the mother of Doran and Oberyn Martell (whose name is still unknown) served as handmaidens to Queen Rhaella in their youth, and while there Joanna and Lady Martell became close friends. Years later, Lady Martell traveled with her children to Casterly Rock, intending to arrive soon after Joanna gave birth to her latest child, only to find that she had died giving birth to Tyrion. She had hoped to arrange a future political marriage between the Lannister and Martell children, but Tywin was so grieved over her death that all he offered was his infant dwarf son Tyrion, which she turned down. In the TV series, Oberyn recalls this trip in Season 4's "Mockingbird" but leaves out any mention of Queen Rhaella - because he also left out any mention of his mother. Instead, he says that it was his father who brought him and his sister Elia on a trip to Casterly Rock, even though Oberyn's mother was actually the Ruling Princess of Dorne in her own right.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rhaella_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemRhaellaTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Naerys Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.10.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Naerys Targaryen was the sister-wife of Aegon IV Targaryen, the eleventh king of the Targaryen dynasty to sit on the Iron Throne. She was an ancestor of Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen.
            Queen Naerys was the mother of Daeron II Targaryen and Daenerys Targaryen by her brother-husband, King Aegon IV Targaryen, who had an affair with their cousin, Daena Targaryen.
            Naerys and her children are mentioned in House Targaryen entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Naerys was the sister of Aegon IV, who was also her husband, and the legendary Prince Aemon, called the Dragonknight. Naerys had the classic Targaryen looks, a very fine and delicate beauty. She was very slender and small, with big purple eyes and fine, pale, porcelain skin, near translucent.
            According to semi-canon sources, she almost died in the cradle and was sickly for most of her life. She was a devout follower of the Faith of the Seven, and once Daeron was born she asked Aegon to release her from her vows so she could join the Faith but he refused her. She was unhappy in her marriage and it was said only her son Daeron or her brother Aemon could make her smile. Her brother, Prince Aemon championed her against the slanders of Ser Morgil and was rumored to, not only have loved her, but also to be the true father of Daeron II. Much later in her life she gave birth to a daughter, Daenerys.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Naerys_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemNaerysTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Nettles</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.11.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nettles was a dragon-rider for Rhaenyra Targaryen's faction during the Dance of the Dragons.
            Nettles was a bastard scion of House Targaryen - known as one of the "dragonseeds".
            Originally she lived in obscurity on the ancestral Targaryen holding, Dragonstone island. Her exact parentage is unknown but she didn't resemble her Targaryen ancestors - instead she was notably dark-skinned (like a Summer Islander).
            As the great Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons progressed, Rhaenyra Targaryen's faction - which was based on Dragonstone - realized that they had more living dragons than dragon-riders, with six riderless beasts nesting on the island. It is believed that only those of Targaryen blood can successfully bond with and ride a dragon, so Rhaenyra proclaimed rewards for any commoners on Dragonstone who could successfully bond with one of the unclaimed dragons - specifically Targaryen bastards and descendants of Targaryen bastards who had been fathered over the years on commoners of the island by young Targaryen princes.
            Nettles was one of only four of the so-called dragonseeds to successfully bond with a dragon, Sheepstealer. She cleverly managed to gain his trust by bringing him gifts of freshly killed sheep until he gradually became accustomed to her presence.
            Nettles rode her dragon throughout the rest of the war. After the capture of King's Landing, she accompanied Rhaenyra's husband (and uncle) Daemon Targaryen with his dragon Caraxes, as they hunted through the Riverlands for Prince Aemond Targaryen on the great dragon Vhagar.
            Eventually, however, after two of the other dragonseeds betrayed Rhaenyra at Tumbleton, she grew paranoid and began to distrust all of the bastard dragonriders, and sent a letter calling for the young girl's head. Particularly, it was said that Daemon himself had taken Nettles as a lover. Daemon was disgusted when he heard of the order: Nettles managed to depart in safety on her dragon, while Daemon issued a challenge to Aemond to come and face him alone. Daemon and Aemond both later arrived at Harrenhal with their dragons, and in the subsequent Battle Above the Gods Eye both men and both dragons perished.[1]
            Nettles and her dragon, however, were never seen again.
            In the prequel novellas, nothing is stated about Nettles's past or family on Dragonstone island prior to becoming a dragon-rider.
            Nettles is consistently described as a "small, brown girl". Apparently she was notably dark-skinned: the "Histories &amp; Lore" featurettes similarly depict her as dark-skinned with black/African features. It's possible that she was a Targaryen bastard (or descendant of a bastard) fathered on a woman from the Summer Islands, and happened to take after her non-Targaryen ancestors in appearance (similarly, one of Oberyn Martell's daughters, Sarella Sand, was fathered on a woman from the Summer Isles, but she just happens to take after her mother in appearance). This would make Nettles the only non-white dragon-rider in the history of Westeros (though not the only female dragon-rider: several women in Rhaenyra's faction including Rhaenyra herself were dragon-riders).
            At the time she claimed her dragon, Nettles is described as 16 years old and skinny. In dress and personality, she is described as being filthy, foul-mouthed, and fearless. She was also called "Netty". Her cunning and intelligence was best evidenced in how she managed to claim her dragon.
            When the call came for "dragonseeds" (Targaryen bastards) on Dragonstone to attempt to bond with the six unclaimed dragons on the island, dozens of potential riders were killed in the attempt. Three of the dragons had known riders before so they were claimed before too long, but the other three were "wild" dragons - they had grown to adulthood never being successfully claimed by any rider at all, and thus were unused to the presence of humans. Eventually many thought it was impossible to bond with a wild dragon at all - until Nettles became the only one to succeed, when she bonded with the dragon known as "Sheepstealer" (a basic descriptive name the commoners of the island referred to him by, given that he had a taste for sheep from their flocks). Nettles realized that simply walking right up to a wild dragon and attempting to mount it was foolhardy (and had gotten many of the other dragonseeds killed), so she cleverly left out a freshly killed sheep every day for an extended period of time, allowing Sheepstealer to become gradually used to her presence.
            Her dragon Sheepstealer was actually one of the older and larger ones in the Dance, hatched "when the Old King was young" (Jaehaerys I), meaning he was at least 80 years old - and probably bigger than either Rhaenyra's dragon Syrax or Daemon's dragon Caraxes. He was described as being an ugly mud-brown color - for this reason, not unlike Nettles herself, previous Targaryens had ignored Sheepstealer, preferring dragons with what they felt were more beautiful colors (until he had gone so many years without a rider than none could bond with him).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Nettles</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemNettles</string></dict>
        <key>Dyanna Dayne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.12.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dyanna Dayne was the wife of Maekar Targaryen, and the mother of his sons Aerion, Aemon, and Aegon.
            On his deathbed, Aemon hallucinates that he is still young and calls out to his long-dead younger Aegon, telling him that their mother is looking for him.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Dyanna Dayne was the wife of Maekar Targaryen and the mother of Daeron, Aerion, Aemon, Daella, Aegon, and Rhae Targaryen.
            She is mentioned in "The Hedge Knight", the first of the Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas. When Egg offers to squire for Dunk at the tourney at Ashford, Dunk asks what his mother would say of it. Egg replies that she would not have anything to say, because she is dead. Her name is revealed in the companion book The World of Ice and Fire.
            It isn't clear exactly when Dyanna died. Egg was around 10 years old at the time of the Tourney at Ashford in 209 AC, when he said his mother was dead. Egg also had one younger sibling, his sister Rhae, so Dyanna must have been alive until at least 201 AC - probably closer to 201 AC than 209 AC, given that Dyanna was old enough to interact with other characters by around 209-210 AC. Whatever the case, Maekar did not become king until many years after Dyanna died, so she was never a Queen Consort (indeed, in 209 AC Maekar's own father was still alive and king, and Maekar's elder brother Aerys I ruled after him, before Maekar succeeded to the throne).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dyanna_Dayne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemDyannaDayne</string></dict>
        <key>Jaehaera Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.13.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Jaehaera Targaryen was a Princess and Queen of the Targaryen dynasty.
            Jaehaera was the only daughter of Aegon II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Helaena Targaryen.
            When the Dance of the Dragons was over, her father resumed his kingship by killing his half-sister, Rhaenyra Targaryen. However, he was poisoned half a year later. Since Jaehaera's brothers, Jaehaerys and Maelor, were both dead by this point, the throne passed to her cousin Aegon III. Her marriage to Aegon led to an official end to the civil war of House Targaryen.[1]
            
            The heavy inbreeding from the Targaryens' incestuous marriages often resulted in mental or physical defects: variants of them may have appeared in Aegon II's children, unsurprisingly, given that his wife was his own sister Helaena. Eldest son Jaehaerys was born with six fingers on his left hand, and six toes on each foot, but otherwise was a completely healthy, mentally stable, and happy young boy. Jaehaerys's twin sister Jaehaera, however, was physically normal but had some sort of mental condition: she was not violently "insane", or blissfully delusional like Baelor Targaryen, but was very shy and had muted responses to events around her. Jaehaera did not smile or cry as a baby, or have any of the normal reactions a baby has. This continued as she grew older, and she was said to be "a strange girl...never weeping or smiling as children do". At the age of six she was called "sweet and simple". From her description, Jaehaera apparently had some form of Asperger's/Autism spectrum mental condition.
            Though in-universe she is called "simple" there is no indication that she was a lackwit (of less than functional intelligence) - rather it seems that in-universe the maesters don't really understand what autistic spectrum disorders are. At the same time, she doesn't appear to have been entirely withdrawn from the world around her (or exhibiting outright selective mutism): given that she is also described as "sweet" and other interactions in the text, she appears to have gotten along well enough with her mother and brothers.
            Jaehaera was bonded to the dragon-hatchling Morghul, though by the time the Dance started he was far too small for even a six-year old girl like her to ride. Morghul died, unridden, during the Storming of the Dragonpit.
            After the murder of Princess Rhaenyra's second son, Prince Lucerys Velaryon, Prince Daemon Targaryen declared vengeance, writing that there would be "an eye for an eye, a son for a son". Jaehaera was present in the Tower of the Hand when Blood slew her twin, Prince Jaehaerys. Prior to the boy's death, as the queen prevaricated, Cheese warned her to make a choice soon, before Blood grew bored and raped Jaehaera.
            When Rhaenyra Targaryen’s dragons first appeared in the skies above King's Landing, Lord Larys Strong spirited Jaehaera out of the city along with her father, Aegon II Targaryen, and younger brother, Maelor. Larys led them out through a secret passage of Maegor's Holdfast, of which only he had knowledge. Jaehaera was put in the charge of Ser Willis Fell, who swore to bring her safely to Storm's End.
            Following the deaths of her parents, brothers, and uncles in the Dance and the victory of the Blacks, Jaehaera was married to her cousin King Aegon III Targaryen as part of the peace agreement. Since she was eight years old at the time of the marriage and Aegon was eleven, it was not consummated.
            Two years after her marriage, Jaehaera died when she reportedly threw herself from Maegor's Holdfast and was impaled on the spikes of the dry moat below. She lived for a half hour in agony before her death. Her grandmother Alicent Hightower was still alive at the time in gentle imprisonment - she lived to see her entire (legitimate) bloodline extinguished. Grieved, Alicent didn't long survive Jaehaera, perishing in the Winter Fever plague that soon swept through Westeros.
            Jaehaera's death was officially deemed a suicide, akin to that of her mother, Queen Helaena. However, many suspected that she had been murdered at the instigation of Lord Unwin Peake, the Hand of the King and one of the seven regents, as Lord Peake hoped to marry his own daughter to King Aegon instead. It was variously suggested that Jaehaera had been murdered by Ser Mervyn Flowers of the Kingsguard, bastard brother of Lord Peake, who had been at her door when she died; or that Mervyn had merely stood aside to allow Tessario the Tiger, a sellsword in Lord Peake's service, to do the deed.
            Whatever the case, Jaehaera was therefore not the mother of any of Aegon III's children in the novels: he later remarried to his cousin Daenaera Velaryon, who bore all of his children. No confirmation has appeared yet that this is also the case in the TV continuity.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jaehaera_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemJaehaeraTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Daenerys Targaryen </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.14.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Princess Daenerys Targaryen was a Princess of the Targaryen dynasty and the namesake of the later Daenerys "Stormborn", daughter of Aerys II. She lived about one century before Daenerys Stormborn. Specifically, she was the younger sister of King Daeron II, who was the grandfather of Daenerys Stormborn's own grandfather, King Aegon V.
            Daenerys was the daughter of King Aegon IV Targaryen and Queen Naerys Targaryen, born on the year 172 after Aegon's Landing. She was the sister of King Daeron II Targaryen. She also had a half-brother, Daemon Blackfyre, born of the affair between her father and Queen Daena Targaryen, the sister-wife of Baelor I Targaryen. She married the Prince of Dorne, Maron of House Martell. Through her brother King Daeron II, Daenerys was the aunt of King Maekar, and thus the great-aunt of both King Aegon V the Unlikely and Aegon V's brother, Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.
            Daenerys, along with her family, is mentioned in the House Targaryen entry of the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Princess Daenerys was born well after her older brother, Daeron II, to the point that Daeron had already married and had a son, Baelor Breakspear. Her betrothal to the Prince of Dorne, Maron Martell, was brokered by her brother Daeron as part of the treaty bringing Dorne under the authority of the Iron Throne. Daenerys supposedly loved her bastard half-brother, Daemon Blackfyre. It was said the main reason Daemon rose in rebellion against Daeron was that Daenerys was denied to him. A year after the rebellion concluded, in 197 AL, the marriage between Daenerys and Maron was carried out and Dorne formally joined to the rest of the Seven Kingdoms.
            After Daemon's death, Prince Maron built his new bride the Water Gardens, a place of beauty made of colored marble with pools and trees. Her children played in the pools along with the children of other highborn lords. One day when the sun was hot, she took pity on the children of the servants and guards and allowed them to play in the pools with the highborn children, starting a tradition that is still kept in Dorne to this day.
            While her brother's descendant Daenerys Stormborn is the second member of the Targaryen family to be named "Daenerys", Daenerys Stormborn is not called "Daenerys II", because "Daenerys, daughter of Aegon IV" never ruled as a queen. In fact, there has never been a ruling Targaryen queen before. When Daenerys Stormborn proclaims herself the rightful heir of the Targaryen dynasty (after her brother dies), she is officially styled as "Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of Her Name". This has been confirmed to be the same in the TV series continuity, as Xaro refers to her as "Daenerys, First of Her Name" in Season 2's "The Ghost of Harrenhal", and this is also how she is formally introduced throughout Seasons 3 and 4.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen_(daughter_of_Aegon_IV)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemDaenerysTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Daenerys Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.15.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen  Daenerys I Targaryen, also known as Dany and Daenerys Stormborn, is the younger sister of Rhaegar Targaryen and Viserys Targaryen, the paternal aunt of Jon Snow, and the youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella Targaryen, who were both ousted from the Iron Throne during Robert Baratheon's rebellion.
            Daenerys is the only daughter and youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen, the "Mad King", and his sister-wife, Rhaella. Her father died during the Sack of King's Landing, before she was even born. The usurper Robert Baratheon installed himself as king, having defeated Aerys in the conquest known as Robert's Rebellion. Her pregnant mother and brother Viserys, fled to the island of Dragonstone, the ancestral home of House Targaryen, to escape Robert. Daenerys's brother Rhaegar Targaryen was killed in the war by Robert. The forces of House Lannister murdered Rhaegar's wife, Elia Martell, and their children, Rhaenys and Aegon, during the Sack of King's Landing.[1]
            But unbeknownst to Daenerys and the rest of her family, her oldest brother Rhaegar had another son by Lyanna Stark, who died shortly after giving birth to him. In her final moments, she revealed the true name of their son to her brother Eddard, who passed the boy off as his bastard son, Jon Snow, and raised him in Winterfell. Jon initially joined the Night's Watch but later became the King in the North.[2]
            On the night Daenerys was born on Dragonstone, a vast storm raged. For this reason, she is sometimes called "Daenerys Stormborn". Her mother died soon after she was born, leaving her an orphan.[1][3] As a baby, she was taken into exile in the Free Cities with her brother, Viserys, by loyal retainers, among them Ser Willem Darry.[1][4][5]
            After years spent fruitlessly trying to raise support to retake the Iron Throne, Viserys and Daenerys were given sanctuary by Magister Illyrio Mopatis in the Free City of Pentos. She dreams of finding a peaceful home and a place to belong. She lives in constant fear of Viserys, who hits her when his temper is risen (in his words, whenever she "wakes the dragon"). Living under Viserys's domination has left her meek and malleable.[6]
            Viserys and Daenerys stay at the estate of Magister Illyrio Mopatis who has brokered a deal for her to marry Khal Drogo of the Dothraki. Daenerys does not want to marry him, but Viserys has traded her to Drogo in exchange for an army of 40,000 men of Drogo's khalasar, which Viserys plans to use in his invasion of Westeros. Viserys tells her that she has no choice. Viserys fondles her under the pretext that he is seeing how she has grown; she looks off into the distance.
            Daenerys enters a bath that her servant warns her is too hot, but it does not affect her; this may be related to her Targaryen heritage. At the wedding she accepts a variety of gifts. She receives three dragon eggs from Magister Illyrio, who tells her that they have been turned to stone by the passage of time. Ser Jorah Mormont, a knight of Westeros, brings books about the Seven Kingdoms and offers Viserys his service. She is given a beautiful white horse (later named Silver) by Drogo. On their wedding night, Daenerys is resistant but Drogo continues regardless.[7]
            Drogo's khalasar marches east for several months. Daenerys seeks advice from her new servant Doreah, trained in the pleasure houses of Lys, on how to best please her husband. Doreah teaches Daenerys how to use her sexuality to influence Drogo and win the status of an equal in his eyes.[8] Irri teaches Daenerys to speak the Dothraki language. Viserys, her brother, attempts to renew his control over her, but her men defend her from his attempts at violence. At first, she begs her men to spare him, but at an encouragement stare from Ser Jorah, she grows confident and orders them to spare Viserys, although he is shamed by being forced to walk. Daenerys discovers that she is pregnant with Drogo's child. She assuredly predicts that she will have a son, to Drogo's approval. The pregnancy buoys the love between them.[9]
            When the khalasar reaches the Dothraki city of Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys invites Viserys to dinner and arranges fresh clothing for him. Viserys reacts angrily at being dressed in the "rags of savages" and strikes Daenerys. Daenerys hits him back with a heavy gold belt and warns that if he strikes her again she will order his hands removed.[10]
            Unbeknownst to Daenerys, word of her pregnancy reaches King's Landing, where King Robert Baratheon orders her assassination. Magister Illyrio secretly visits his ally Varys in the city, where they discuss how they will pave the way for the Targaryen restoration.[11]
            Daenerys eats the raw heart of a stallion before the eyes of the dosh khaleen, the Dothraki wise women, and names her unborn son Rhaego in honor of her slain brother, Rhaegar Targaryen. The Dothraki crones prophesy that Daenerys's son will be the Stallion Who Mounts the World, the "khal of khals" who will unite the Dothraki into a single horde that will overrun all the lands of the world.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemDaenerysTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Daena Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.16.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Daena Targaryen, also called Daena the Defiant, was a Queen of the Targaryen dynasty.
            Daena Targaryen was a Queen of the Targaryen dynasty and a sister of Baelor the Blessed, who imprisoned her along with their sisters Rhaena and Elaena in the Maidenvault to prevent himself from being tempted by carnal thoughts.[1]
            She also became the lover of her cousin, Aegon IV Targaryen. From their union, Daemon Blackfyre was born.
            Daena is mentioned in House Targaryen's entry in the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daena was the bride of her brother, King Baelor Targaryen. He had taken her as his wife at the insistence of his father, Aegon III. However, the two never consummated their marriage. Instead, Baelor had, dissolved his marriage to Daena, and then, along with her sisters Rhaena and Elaena, locked her inside a section of the Red Keep that would become known as the Maidenvault, so they wouldn't incite him or others in the court to lust. During this time she escaped her confinement several times and had an affair with her first cousin Aegon, despite the fact that he was married to his sister Naerys. When she became pregnant she refused to name the father and became known as "Daena the Defiant." She named her son Daemon and raised him alone.
            The royal succession laws were changed after the disastrous civil war between Rhaenyra Targaryen, Aegon III's mother, and Rhaenyra's half-brother Aegon II. While under normal Andal inheritance law a lord's daughter would inherit his lands and titles if he had no surviving sons, the new laws wanted to ensure that another royal succession war such as the one surrounding Rhaenyra would never occur again. Therefore, the new succession laws (enacted during the reign of Daena's own father) put female heirs behind all possible male heirs. Under normal Andal inheritance laws, with both of Aegon III's sons dead, the throne should have passed to Daena as his eldest surviving daughter. Under the new inheritance laws, however, the throne had to pass to Aegon III's nearest surviving male heir - his younger brother Viserys II (uncle of Daena, and father of her lover Aegon).
            Daena's cousin Aegon later succeeded his father as King Aegon IV. On his deathbed, Aegon IV legitimized all of his bastard children - including acknowledging that Daemon was in fact his own son. He even gave Daemon the ancestral Valyrian steel sword of House Targaryen, Blackfyre, which had been wielded by Aegon the Conqueror himself. After being legitimized, he took the formal name "Daemon Blackfyre", and founded the Cadet branch of House Targaryen known as House Blackfyre. Aegon IV's trueborn son succeeded to the throne as King Daeron II Targaryen. Over the next six generations House Blackfyre would launch repeated attempts to seize the throne from the main branch of the Targaryen family.
            As a result, all subsequent generations of House Blackfyre descended from Daena and Aegon III (as well as Aegon IV) - albeit as legitimized bastards. Some even pointed out that had the succession laws not changed, Daena would have inherited the throne ahead of her uncle Viserys II. Meanwhile, subsequent generations of the main Targaryen family descend from Aegon IV and Viserys II, but not from Viserys II's older brother Aegon III. The Blackfyres and their supporters felt this gave them a superior claim to the throne, while the main Targaryen family (Daeron II and his descendants) held that it did not due to Daemon's status as a legitimized bastard.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daena_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemDaenaTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Visenya Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.17.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Visenya Targaryen was the sister and wife of Aegon the Conqueror and helped him in his invasion and conquest of Westeros.
            Harrenhal was burned by dragonfire during the War of Conquest, and all three dragons later deployed at the Field of Fire, where they destroyed the largest army ever fielded against their troops and broke the back of resistance to their rule in Westeros.[1]
            She was the mother of Maegor Targaryen, known as Maegor the Cruel, the third King of the Seven Kingdoms, but he died without issue, so all of the subsequent Targaryen rulers (including Daenerys Targaryen) claim their descent from Visenya's sister, Rhaenys.
            Arya Stark, while posing as a common serving girl in Lannister-occupied Harrenhal, reveals to Tywin Lannister that Visenya was a heroine of hers. She shows knowledge of Visenya's role in razing Harrenhal.[1]
            Shireen Baratheon gives Davos Seaworth a book about Aegon the Conqueror to read during his incarceration.[2] Just before his release, Davos reads a passage about Visenya, having a bit of difficulty reading her name and that of Vhagar.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Visenya is the oldest of the three Targaryen siblings born to Aerion Targaryen, Lord of Dragonstone, and his wife, Valaena Velaryon. She is said to have been the more temperamental of Aegon's sisters. She was a noted warrior but also had diplomatic skills. After the razing of Harrenhal, she flew on her dragon to Crackclaw Point and won the support of the native inhabitants by promising that they would hold fealty only to the Iron Throne and no other lords.
            The World of Ice and Fire confirms that Visenya was the more martial of the two sisters. She supported the Targaryen fleet when it attempted to take Gulltown early during the War of Conquest, but was unable to prevent its destruction at the hands of the Arryn fleet. She did destroy much of the Arryn fleet with her dragon in vengeance, but could not follow up on the victory. Later, she joined her brother-husband on the Field of Fire, helping win a great victory there (despite sustaining a wound from an arrow). Afterwards she managed to secure the loyalty of House Arryn by simply flying her dragon to the Eyrie and allowing King Ronnel, a child, a ride on her dragon's back, thus avoiding a bloody conflict.
            Though beautiful, skilled in battle and fierce, Visenya was somewhat stand-offish in matters of the heart. Aegon allegedly spent only one night with her for every ten he spent with Rhaenys. For that matter, Visenya was also a skilled ruler: Aegon did weigh in on major decisions both before and after the Conquest, but he usually left his sisters to handle the day-to-day tasks of governance (aided after the conquest by the new "Hand of the King", their bastard half-brother Orys Baratheon). It was Visenya who conceived of the Kingsguard, as Aegon had been somewhat lax in security after the Conquest was completed. Although to be fair, he never expected his sister-wife to slash his face with Dark Sister to prove her point. Even then, Aegon had Visenya design the order and iron out the details of its foundation.
            Rhaenys died in Dorne before the end of Aegon's reign, and a few years after Aegon's death their bastard half-brother Orys died during a rebellion in the Vale, meaning that Visenya was the last surviving member of the Conquest-generation of Targaryens. She continued to exert political influence during the reign of Aegon's successor, Rhaenys's son Aenys I. Through unexplained circumstances, despite the fact that Aenys I had three sons, he was succeeded by his half-brother Maegor, who killed two of his aforementioned nephews. Visenya died later in Maegor's reign.
            Maegor was the only child that Visenya ever had. When Maegor came of age, he married one of the daughters of Visenya's sister Rhaenys (the daughter was thus Maegor's half-sister, and full-sister of King Aenys). Maegor died without surviving issue, and so he was succeeded by Aenys's last surviving son Jaehaerys I - which means that later generations of Targaryens (such as Daenerys Targaryen) are not directly descended from Visenya.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Visenya_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemVisenyaTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Alysanne Targaryen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.18.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Queen Alysanne Targaryen was the sister-wife of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, fourth king of the Targaryen Dynasty. Alysanne rode the dragon Silverwing, and her husband Jaehaerys rode the dragon Vermithor.
            Alysanne was the sister-wife of Jaehaerys I, the fourth king of the Targaryen dynasty, and reigned over two centuries before the War of the Five Kings. Like Jaehaerys, she was a child of the second Targaryen king, Aenys Targaryen.  Their uncle Maegor the Cruel seized the Iron Throne upon their father's death, during the Faith Militant uprising.
            After Maegor eventually died, Jaehaerys ascended to the throne, with Alysanne as his queen.  Jaehaerys and Alysanne ruled so long that upon Jaehaerys's death, he was succeeded by their grandson, Viserys I Targaryen.
            Queen Alysanne was a dragon-rider.  Her mount was Silverwing, one of the large second-generation progeny of the original three Targaryen dragons.[1]
            
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jaehaerys I is fondly remembered as one of the best kings the Targaryen dynasty ever produced, and his sister-wife Alysanne is similarly remembered as one of its best queens.  Indeed, Alysanne was practically a co-ruler with Jaehaerys, heavily involved in governing the realm - and given that they were both children of the past king and married to each other, it was somewhat of a moot point exactly which one of them was the "official" monarch (technically Jaehaerys was).
            Jaehaerys I and Alysanne were the youngest children of Aegon I's older son, Aenys I, a weakling who did not easily hold onto the throne.  He died of stress at the outbreak of the Faith Militant uprising, at which his younger brother Maegor the Cruel usurped the throne ahead of Aenys's own children.  Maegor killed Aenys's eldest son Aegon in battle, then forced his sister-wife Rhaena (Maegor's own half-niece) to marry him.  When Maegor's mother Visenya died in 44 AC it caused enough of a distraction for Aenys's wife Alyssa Velaryon to flee their captivity on Dragonstone along with Jaehaerys and Alysanne.  Aenys's second son Viserys was then tortured to death by Maegor at King's Landing in retaliation.   Jaehaerys was left as Aenys's heir, and rebel lords across the realm increasingly switched loyalty to him.  In the end there was no great new civil war as all of Maegor's allies totally abandoned him, and he opened his wrists on the Iron Throne rather than be taken alive.
            The subsequent reign of Jaehaerys I and Alysanne lasted over 50 years and was a golden age of peace and prosperity across all of Westeros.  Alysanne is popularly remembered as "Good Queen Alysanne".  Among her many acts governing the kingdoms, she convinced Jaehaerys to enact several new domestic violence and rape laws.  A dragon rider like her husband, Alysanne once flew to Winterfell on a royal visit - her on Silverwing, Jaehaerys I on Vermithor, along with four other dragons.  On a whim she flew ahead to The Wall, and on seeing the poor state of repair that the Night's Watch had dwindled to she became a great patron of the order, paying with her own jewelry.
            Jaehaerys and Alysanne ruled wisely and well for over fifty years. Jaehaerys lived so long that he actually outlived Alysanne as well as most of his children (many of whom died untimely deaths), and was thus succeeded by his grandson Viserys I - the only time in history that a king was succeeded by his grandson. Alysanne predeceased Jaehaerys by about three years, and her loss broke the old king for the few remaining years of his life, leaving him bedridden until his death.
            In terms of Alysanne's personality and temperament, Alysanne was the very model of a dignified, wise, yet powerful monarch (much like her brother-husband).  George R.R. Martin described her appearance (for licensed artwork) as similar to Katharine Hepburn's portrayal of Eleanor of Aquitaine in the 1968 film adaptation of The Lion in Winter.
            Jaehaerys and Alysanne had thirteen children together. In order of birth, their names were Aegon, Alyssa, Aemon, Baelon, Daella, Aeryn, Vaegon, Maegelle, Valerion, Viserra, Gaemon, Saera, and Gael - but of these thirteen only nine would live to adulthood:  Aegon, Aeryn, Valerion, and Gaemon all died young.  Apparently, only four of them had children in turn (and two of them, Baelon and Alyssa, were married to each other).
            Aemon married outside of the family, to Jocelyn Baratheon, and had a daughter whom he named Rhaenys, after his father's grandmother. Aemon died in 92 AL fighting against Myrish pirates who had seized the eastern side of Tarth. Jaehaerys ultimately chose Baelon over Rhaenys as his heir - despite the fact that an older daughter normally succeeded ahead of a younger uncle according to the normal inheritance laws in Westeros.  The exact circumstances that led to such a decision are unclear but it briefly caused a major rift between Jaehaerys and Alysanne.
            Baelon himself had two surviving children with his sister Alyssa, sons Viserys and Daemon.  Baelon was also named Hand of the King, but later died of a burst belly in 101 AL, two years before Jaehaerys I died, leading to a Great Council to determine who the heir should be. Rhaenys again put forward her claim, along with those of her children Laenor and Laena Velaryon, but she was again rejected in favor of Jaehaerys's grandson Viserys I Targaryen. Daella married Lord Rodrik Arryn and died giving birth to a daughter, Aemma Arryn, who was the first wife of Viserys I and the mother of Rhaenyra Targaryen.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Alysanne_Targaryen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemAlysanneTargaryen</string></dict>
        <key>Silverwing</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.19.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Silverwing was one of the dragons that belonged to House Targaryen. It was once the mount of Queen Alysanne Targaryen. During the great civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, Silverwing was the mount of Ulf the White.
            Silverwing was left riderless on Dragonstone island for many years after the death of Queen Alysanne. During the Dance of the Dragons, Rhaenyra Targaryen's faction - the Blacks - was based on the island, but realized that they possessed more dragons than riders. It was believed that only those of the Targaryen bloodline could successfully bond with dragons, but over the generations the Targaryens had produced numerous bastard children and grandchildren with the commoners of the isle.
            Rhaenyra put out a call for any who believed they were a bastard of Targaryen blood to attempt to mount and bond the six riderless dragons, offering reward of gold and title. Many of these bastards - called Dragonseeds - died in the attempt, but ultimately four of them succeeded. Silverwing was claimed by the bastard called Ulf the White.
            Hugh and Vermithor fought on Rhaenyra's side in the civil war for some time, but during its later stages Ulf and another dragonseed, Hugh Hammer, decided to betray her. When a large Green army of House Hightower advanced towards King's Landing after a long journey up from the south, Rhaenyra sent an army with two dragons to counter it: Vermithor ridden by Hugh Hammer, and Silverwing ridden by Ulf the White. In the ensuing Sack of Tumbleton, however, both Hugh and Ulf switched sides and turned their dragons against Rhaenyra's own army.
            Luckily for Rhaenyra, rather than continue to advance on nearby King's Landing, Hugh and Ulf instead chose to drink and whore amid the ruins of Tumbleton with the Green army, unable to agree on what specific course of action to take next.[1]
            At the start of the Dance, Silverwing was one of the older and larger dragons, apparently one of the powerful second-generation dragons hatched to the Targaryens' original three.
            Silverwing's exact coloration hasn't been stated but was presumably silver or silver-white (or at least predominantly silver, it is unknown if she had a secondary color).
            Silverwing was famously the mount of Queen Alysanne Targaryen, sister-wife of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, the Old King whose great and prosperous reign lasted 55 years. He was also a dragon-rider, and his mount was the great Vermithor, largest of the remaining dragons behind Vhagar herself (last of the first-generation dragons). It has been speculated that there is some sort of magical/psychic or at least emotional bond between dragons and their riders, so that they like friends of their rider and scorn their enemies. In this case, Vermithor and Silverwing were actually a mated pair, mirroring the marriage between their two riders, and continued to remain so even after their original riders died. They "oft coiled about each other in the fields" when their armies weren't on the move during the Dance. Their matings may have produced some of the younger dragons at the time of the Dance.
            At one point Jaehaerys I and Alysanne made a royal visit to Winterfell, riding Vermithor and Silverwing respectively, along with four other dragons. On a whim, Alysanne rode further up to The Wall itself, and Jaehaerys I followed on Vermithor. They visited the then-headquarters of the Night's Watch, the Nightfort. Seeing how badly it had fallen into disrepair from the dwindling Watch, the royal couple convinced them to abandon it and relocate to the more manageable Castle Black to the east. Some two centuries later, when Samwell Tarly was passing through the Nightfort with Gilly as he returned from beyond the Wall, he thought to himself about how the dragon Silverwing had once stood in that very courtyard, and he idly wondered if she may have left behind any eggs.
            The novels never give the lineage of any of the Targaryen dragons, though it is fairly clear that Silverwing was one of the powerful second-generation dragons hatched after the Targaryen Conquest. Live-readings that George R.R. Martin has done of his more extensive private notes mention that towards the end of Aegon I's life, there were about half a dozen dragon hatchlings. When Aegon I died several localized rebellions sprang up against his weak older son Aenys Targaryen, but Maegor helped put them down riding Balerion. Following this, two new dragons hatched at the same time, which was taken as a good omen for relations between the two brothers in the future (which turned out to be false). These two hatchlings may have been Vermithor and Silverwing, given how they were always a pair.
            Silverwing was left riderless after Jaehaerys I's death, and had no other until she was claimed by Ulf 30 years later during the Dance. Of the six riderless dragons left on Dragonstone island, she was one of the three who were only semi-wild; compared to the other three who had grown to adulthood without riders at all. As a result, while Silverwing killed a few Dragonseeds who attempted to mount her, she was relatively accustomed to the presence of men and before too long accepted Ulf as her rider.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Silverwing</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemSilverwing</string></dict>
        <key>Dreamfyre</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.20.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dreamfyre was a dragon bred by House Targaryen.
            During the Dance of the Dragons, an angry mob of smallfolk stormed the Dragonpit where House Targaryen stabled their dragons. Dreamfyre was among the five dragons killed, breaking free of her chains and crashing into the domed ceiling only to smash it and be crushed by falling debris.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire, Dreamfyre was hatched at some point prior to the reign of King Maegor I Targaryen, and was ridden by King Aenys Targaryen's daughter and eldest child, Princess Rhaena Targaryen.
            Dreamfyre later bonded with Queen Helaena Targaryen, sister-wife of King Aegon II Targaryen. During the Dance of the Dragons, after Helaena's six year old son Jaehaerys was slain during the civil war, Helaena spent her days in darkness, weeping, and was not capable of riding her dragon. She eventually went mad with grief and threw herself from her window in Maegor's Holdfast and died. At the moment of her death Dreamfyre rose suddenly with a roar that shook the Dragonpit and snapped two of the chains that bound her.
            During the Storming of the Dragonpit the four dragons lairing within the dome were in chains. Dreamfyre was the only dragon able to break free when the mob broke in. She broke from her remaining bonds and took wing. She circled the cavernous interior of the dome and swooped down to attack the men below. She slew more men that the other three dragons combined. The mob pushed through her attacks and she was within easy reach of archers and crossbowmen. They loosed arrows and quarrels at the her. Wherever she lighted men swarmed to attack her driving her back into the air. Eventually one of her eyes was nicked by a crossbow bolt. Half-blind and maddened, Dreamfyre flew into the Dragonpit’s great dome above. The already weakened dome cracked on impact and half of it came tumbling down, crushing her and the dragonslayers under tons of broken stone and rubble.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dreamfyre</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemDreamfyre</string></dict>
        <key>Syrax</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.21.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Syrax was a dragon bred by House Targaryen.
            During the Dance of the Dragons, Syrax was the mount of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, who rode her into King's Landing. Eventually, an angry mob of smallfolk stormed the Dragonpit where House Targaryen stabled their dragons. Syrax was among the five dragons killed.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire, Syrax was a she-dragon ridden solely by Rhaenyra Targaryen.
            Syrax had yellow scales. She was huge and formidable, but not as fearsome or experienced in battle as Caraxes. She was kept in chains and exceedingly well fed. She had not hunted for years at the time of the civil war.
            Rhaenyra first took Syrax as a mount in 104 AC, when the princess was seven years old. Syrax was described as a "young" dragon at the time, and Rhaenyra herself named her "Syrax" (after a Valyrian goddess) - strongly implying that Syrax had no previous rider.
            Syrax laid "several" clutches of eggs during the reign of Viserys I. Her latest clutch was produced just prior to the civil war. One of the eggs from that latest clutch was given to Rhaena, Rhaenyra's step-daughter.
            Following her difficult stillbirth at the beginning of the war, Rhaenyra recovered enough strength to fly on Syrax, along with her other dragonriders, when they assaulted and captured King's Landing, with little opposition.
            In King's Landing Syrax was kept within the walls of the Red Keep in a stable in the outer ward that had been emptied of horses and given over for her use. Heavy chains bound her to the ground. The chains were long enough to allow her to move from the stable to yard but kept her from flying off riderless. The three other dragons belonging to the blacks were kept in the Dragonpit along with the greens's Dreamfyre.
            Syrax was slain in the aftermath of the Storming of the Dragonpit. Prince Joffrey Velaryon had attempted to mount her to ride to the Dragonpit, save the other dragons, and perhaps mount his own dragon Tyraxes there. Dragons are not horses, however, and they will only accept one mount at a time. In mid-flight, Syrax shrugged off Joffrey, who fell to his death. Attracted by the bloodshed, Syrax continued on to the Dragonpit. Archmaester Gyldayn noted that Syrax could have simply stayed high in the air and made runs at the mob with her flames, but instead she descended upon the ground, killing dozens with tooth and claw. There are numerous and contradicting accounts about specifically how Syrax died, and Gyldayn does not give them in detail. What is certain is that Syrax eventually died fighting the rioters.
            In the The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling by Maester Munkun writes that Vhagar roasted Ser Byron Swann when he tried to kill her by sneaking up behind his shield so the dragon would see only her reflection - as Serwyn of the Mirror Shield did to Urrax. However, according to Tyrion Lannister, Grand Maester Munkun errs, the dragon was in fact Syrax.
            That it was Syrax makes much more sense than Munkun’s version as Ser Byron Swann was the son of a marcher lord, and Storm's End was for King Aegon II Targaryen. Vhagar was ridden by Prince Aemond Targaryen, Aegon’s brother and fellow green.
            Archmaester Gyldayn's history of the civil war sheds no further light on the matter as it gives no account of Ser Byron Swann's attempt to slay a dragon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Syrax</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemSyrax</string></dict>

            Vhagar was flown by Aegon's sister-wife Visenya during the War of Conquest. She was one of the three dragons present at the Field of Fire, the decisive battle of the conquest that ensured Targaryen mastery of the Seven Kingdoms.
            Nonetheless, House Arryn thought that the Vale could still resist Targaryen domination by hiding behind the impregnable Mountains of the Moon along their borders, and fortifying the mountain passes beyond any hope of attack. Similar to how Aegon had dealt with Harrenhal, Visenya simply flew Vhagar directly over the mountains, and came to rest in the courtyard of the Arryn's own castle, the Eyrie. At the time, the King of Mountain and Vale was only a small boy, Ronnel Arryn, whose mother Sharra was acting as his regent. Visenya did not need to burn the Eyrie as Aegon had burned Harrenhal: her display
            of force with Vhagar was enough to compel the Arryns to surrender. Young Ronnel did ask one condition for his surrender: in return, Visenya would give him a ride around the Eyrie atop her dragon. The Vale surrendered, and true to her word, Visenya gave Ronnel a ride atop Vhagar.[5]
            Vhagar lived for another 130 years after the Conquest, until the great Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. In The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling, Grand Maester Munkun wrote that Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar so he polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror and he crouched behind it and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection, but the dragon only saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield and burnt him to a crisp.[6]
            Ultimately, Vhagar died in the Battle Above the Gods Eye, in which she killed and was killed by the dragon Caraxes.[7]
            While she is in the service of Tywin Lannister in Harrenhal, Arya Stark mentions that Vhagar was one of the three dragons used in the War of Conquest, ridden by Visenya Targaryen.[2]
            While incarcerated and learning to read, Davos Seaworth had trouble reading Vhagar's name.[4]
            Shireen Baratheon is reading The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling and retells the story of Ser Byron Swann to Ser Davos Seaworth which they share a laugh over.[6]
            Laena Velaryon, daughter of Lord Corlys Velaryon and Princess Rhaenys Targaryen and wife to Prince Daemon Targaryen, rode Vhagar during the reign of Viserys I Targaryen. Laena eventually died in childbirth and not long after, Vhagar accepted Prince Aemond Targaryen as his rider.
            After Meraxes and then Balerion died, Vhagar was the last of the original three Targaryen dragons. Meraxes died fighting in Dorne, while Balerion later died of old age (about forty years before the Dance of the Dragons).
            Vhagar was ridden by Aemond Targaryen during the Dance of the Dragons, the Targaryen civil war between Aegon II and Rhaenyra Targaryen. Aemond sided with his brother Aegon II. Vhagar was the greatest and most powerful living dragon during the Dance, by that time grown nearly as big as Balerion was during the War of Conquest, and she was one of the major advantages possessed by Aegon II's faction. In one of the opening moves of the war, Aemond rode Vhagar to attack and kill Rhaenyra's son Lucerys at Storm's End, while he was riding the young dragon Arrax - Vhagar killed both with little difficulty. At the Battle of Rook's Rest, Aegon II's forced laid a trap for Rhaenys Targaryen and her dragon Meleys (not the original Rhaenys, but her grandson Jaehaerys I's grandaughter). After Rhaenys arrived, she was ambushed by Aemond riding Vhagar and Aegon II riding Sunfyre. While Sunfyre was badly wounded, the great dragon Meleys was killed. Afterwards, Aemond used Vhagar to burn out vast swaths of the Riverlands, which had sided with Rhaenyra. Nonetheless, Vhagar and Aemond were eventually killed during the Dance, in a great duel with Prince Daemon Targaryen and his dragon Caraxes at Harrenhal.
            Grand Maester Munkun's historical account claims that Ser Byron Swann attempted to sneak up on and kill Vhagar by hiding behind a mirrored shield - which is mentioned in Season 5 of the TV series. In the novels, Swann used this tactic in imitation of the legendary tale in which Serwyn of the Mirror Shield snuck up on and killed the dragon Urrax by hiding behind a polished shield, so the dragon only saw its reflection (it isn't clear if Serwyn and Urrax ever really existed). The TV episode didn't have time to explain this in more context, but at one point Tyrion remarks that Munkun's account was inaccurate on this point: Balon Swann actually tried to sneak up on Rhaenyra's dragon Syrax, not Vhagar. House Swann was sworn to the Baratheons, who declared for Aegon II, so as Tyrion pointed out, it wouldn't make sense for Swann to try to kill the greatest dragon belonging to Aegon II's faction, ridden by Aegon Ii's own brother. Either way, of course, the result was the same: the legendary trick didn't actually work and the dragon killed Swann (whether because real dragons can actually recognize their own reflection, or because the dragon could obviously tell that there was a man behind it, is unclear).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Vhagar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemVhagar</string></dict>
        <key>Meraxes</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.23.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Meraxes was the dragon ridden by Rhaenys Targaryen during the War of Conquest.[1][2] Meraxes was said to be capable of swallowing an entire horse.[3] It participated in the Field of Fire, but was downed by a Dornish arrow in the First Dornish War, crashing to its death with Rhaenys on its back.
            Four years after Aegon I was crowned, the Targaryens had consolidated their position over the other kingdoms enough to launch another determined invasion of Dorne, known as the First Dornish War. Once again, the Dornishmen resorted to guerilla tactics instead of open battle, harassing the Targaryen armies then retreating - and massacring the large land army they attempted to lead through the Red Mountains.
            Rhaenys and Meraxes were both killed during the war in 10AL. At Hellholt, in the middle of Dorne's central desert, Meraxes died when a lucky shot with a scorpion-bolt pierced her eye and drove into her brain, instantly killing her in mid-air. Rhaenys presumably died when the dragon plummeted hundreds of feet to the ground - though unsubstantiated rumors (or myths) allege that Rhaenys survived the fall, badly injured, but the Dornish slowly tortured and mutilated her to death in revenge. At the end of the war in 13 AL, the Dornish returned Meraxes's skull to King's Landing as a peace offering.
            George R.R. Martin only figured out the details of Meraxes's death some time after he wrote the first novel, which introduces a conundrum: when Tyrion saw the three largest dragon skulls kept under the Red Keep, he thought the smallest one belonged to Vhagar, who was indeed the smallest at the time of the War of Conquest. The revelation that Vhagar outlived Meraxes complicates this, however, and indeed the The Princess and the Queen novella states that when Vhagar died 130 years after the War of Conquest, she had grown almost as large as Balerion. The simple answer is probably that as with all POV narrations, Tyrion's POV is not objectively true, and he simply assumed that the smallest skull belonged to Vhagar - even though logically, it should have belonged to Meraxes.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Meraxes</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemMeraxes</string></dict>
        <key>Meleys</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.1.24.02</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Meleys was one of the dragons that belonged to House Targaryen, which fought during the great civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, during which it was the mount of Rhaenyra Targaryen's former mother-in-law Rhaenys Targaryen.
            During the Dance, Meleys was the mount of Rhaenys Targaryen, known as "The Queen Who Never Was".
            In the opening moves of the war, Rhaenyra's rival Aegon II Targaryen and his new Hand of the King, Criston Cole of the Kingsguard, led their army to attack Rook's Rest, a castle on the mainland north of Rhaenyra's stronghold on Dragonstone which had declared for her.
            Besieged, the castle's lord sent messenger-ravens desperately begging for Rhaenyra to send aid. When help did arrive it was not an army, however, but Rhaenys riding her large red dragon Meleys, which proceeded to burn many of the soldiers besieging Rook's Rest.
            It was all a trap, however, as two enemy dragons suddenly confronted Meleys: Aegon II riding Sunfyre, and Vhagar - the largest and greatest living dragon - ridden by Aegon II's younger brother Aemond Targaryen.
            Meleys had no hope of winning against both of them, but to her credit Rhaenys did not flee, instead turning Meleys to meet them head-on. In the massive mid-air battle that followed dragon fought dragon, and their flames burned so brightly it was as if a second sun blossomed in the sky.
            When the smoke of their confrontation finally cleared, only Vhagar and Aemond were not seriously wounded. Meleys was dead, torn to shreds, and her rider Rhaenys burned to ash. Yet Meleys did not die without exacting a price: she had maimed Sunfyre, almost completely tearing one of his wings from his body. Aegon II himself was gravely wounded, crushed under his dragon and severely burned over half his body. He survived, but had to be sedated with Milk of the poppy, and remained hovering out of consciousness for months. This left Aemond to command Aegon II's faction while his brother convalesced - another serious blow, as it turned out, for Aemond was hot-head and poor strategist, easily fooled into leaving King's Landing poorly defended.[1]
            In the prequel novellas, Meleys was known as "the Red Queen", which seems to indicate that she was the mother of several of the other dragons (much as Rhaenys was grandmother to the youngest generation of dragon-riders). Her exact age and lineage has not yet been established.
            Meleys does appear to have been one of the oldest and largest dragons after Vhagar herself, and was probably one of the second generation dragons hatched to the original three from the Conquest-generation (Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar). Vhagar was 181 years old during the Dance, and by that point as said to have grown as large as Balerion had been during the War of Conquest. Vhagar is also described as being five times the size of the young dragon Arrax, who was only a decade or so old and only just big enough to ride to war. It was widely believed that no dragon could defeat Vhagar in a one-on-one fight - even Daemon doubted if Caraxes could face her and live (and indeed, only later managed to defeat Vhagar in a mutual kill). In contrast, it is mentioned in passing that if Vhagar faced Meleys alone, Meleys was big enough that she might have at least held her own. This is why Aegon II made sure to double-team Meleys with both Vhagar and Sunfyre - and even against such unfavorable odds, Meleys still managed to cripple Sunfyre before being killed.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Meleys</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTTargaryenFemMeleys</string></dict>
