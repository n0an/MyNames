        <key>FN-9330</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>FN-9330 was a human[3] male stormtrooper who served in the First Order during their conflict with the Resistance. During the Battle of Starkiller Base, FN-9330 was stationed at the base. As the stormtrooper boarded the transport compartment, the door opened, and Han Solo, Finn, and Chewbacca appeared. He had just enough time to exclaim his surprise before being shot point-blank with the Wookiee's bowcaster, blasting the trooper several feet backwards and killing him. Chewbacca then moved him out of sight to avoid detection at the base.[2]
            FN-9330 was played by Nigel Godrich in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015. Godrich, a well-known record producer, landed the role with the help of British filmmaker Edgar Wright (friend and frequent collaborator of Simon Pegg).[5] The specific stormtrooper he played was discovered when Matthew Wood posted the credits for every small voiceover line in the film.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/FN-9330</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFN9330</string></dict>
        <key>JA189</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.2.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>JA189 was a TIE fighter pilot who served the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. After the Battle of Hoth, JA189 and three other pilots were sent into the Hoth asteroid belt to chase down the Millennium Falcon. Imperial Lieutenant Commander Ciena Ree helped coordinate the four pilots from on board the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor, but even with her aid all four TIE/ln space superiority starfighters crashed within the belt while chasing the Falcon. JA189 was the second to crash.
            JA189 was the designation[3] of a human[2] TIE fighter pilot who served in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. JA189[3] was stationed on board an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, when it traveled to the Hoth system as part of an attack on the Rebel Base located on the planet Hoth. The Empire successfully defeated the Alliance on the surface of Hoth, but a large number of the Rebels escaped the planet in transports protected from the Imperial fleet by an ion cannon. Following the conclusion of the battle, the Sith Lord Darth Vader demanded that at least three of the six Imperial-class Star Destroyers present for the battle, chase and capture one Rebel vessel in particular, the YT-1300 light freighter named the Millennium Falcon.[1]
            The Falcon fled from the Imperials into an asteroid belt located in the Hoth system in the hopes of hiding from them there. As the Star Destroyers were unable to give chase in the belt, JA189 and three other TIE pilots were dispatched from one of the Destroyers and gave chase in TIE/ln space superiority starfighters,[1] despite entering such a belt in an unshielded craft being tantamount to suicide. Lieutenant Commander Ciena Ree provided auxiliary navigational assistance for the four pilots from onboard the bridge of Vader's personal flagship, the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor. Despite her assistance, the TIE pilot CR978's vessel collided with an asteroid and exploded. Moments later, Ree gave warning that JA189's computer was not linking up, but was too late, as a small asteroid clipped JA189's TIE and caused it to spin out of control and then explode, killing the pilot. The two remaining pilots, OL701 and NA811, soon suffered a similar fate to JA189,[3] and the Falcon ultimately escaped Imperial clutches.[1] Ree was deeply disheartened by the deaths of the four pilots, but was congratulated for her work helping them by Admiral Firmus Piett, the commanding officer of the Executor. Piett believed the four pilots had never stood a chance anyway, and that Ree had managed to keep them alive longer than they would have survived on their own.[3]
            JA189's TIE fighter first appeared in the original release of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back in 1980, although the pilot was not visible in the film. JA189 was first identified and heard in the novel Lost Stars, which was written by Claudia Gray and released in 2015.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/JA189</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJA189</string></dict>
        <key>FN-2199</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.3.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>FN-2199, nicknamed "Nines," was a human male stormtrooper who served the First Order in the decades following the Galactic Civil War. He served alongside his friend and brother-in-arms, FN-2187. Following FN-2187's desertion, Nines confronted his former comrade at the Battle of Takodana where they fought each other in single combat. Accusing the former trooper of treason, Nines gained the upper hand but was fatally shot by Han Solo before he could kill FN-2187.
            FN-2199 was a stormtrooper who served the First Order in the decades after the Galactic Civil War. Training in the FN Corps alongside FN-2000 "Zeroes," FN-2003 "Slip," and FN-2187 "Eight-Seven," he took the nickname "Nines" because he liked the sound of it. They trained under Captain Phasma, practicing in simulated combat for most of their lives. During their first deployment, the FN Corps was brought to the mining facility in Pressy's Tumble, an asteroid field, and ordered to kill the workers that had gone on strike. Initially reluctant, Nines followed as ordered once Slip and Zeroes opened fire.[2]
            During the conflict between the First Order and the Republic-backed Resistance, Kylo Ren of the Knights of Ren sought part of a map that led to Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who had vanished years earlier. The map was held by BB-8, an astromech droid that the First Order tracked to the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata on the planet Takodana. Nines was one of the soldiers in the division that followed Ren to Takodana where he attempted to acquire the droid in the early stages of the new galactic conflict. By then, FN-2187 defected from the First Order after witnessing the massacre of Tuanul on Jakku.[3]
            Nines encountered his old comrade,[1] who now went by the name of "Finn,"[3] during the raid on Takodana. Utilizing a Z6 riot control baton[1] against a Jedi lightsaber wielded by Finn,[3] Nines attempted to subdue the former stormtrooper through single combat.[1] Although he gained the upper hand in their duel, knocking Finn to the ground with a direct hit to the torso,[3] Nines was ultimately gunned down by Han Solo,[1] who shot the unsuspecting trooper with Chewbacca's bowcaster.[3]
            Nines was a human male who had red hair, blue eyes and light skin.[2] Trained since birth,[1] he was a loyal soldier in the armed forces of the First Order, to the point of executing civilians in spite of his own reluctance to carry out such an order.[2] Finn's desertion of the Stormtrooper Corps angered Nines, who denounced his former friend as a traitor.[1] He discarded his F-11D blaster rifle and riot shield, choosing to attack Finn with only a single melee weapon.[3]
            FN-2199 was first introduced in the 2015 novel Before the Awakening, written by Greg Rucka.[2] He appeared in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.[3]
            FN-2199 was physically portrayed by veteran stuntman Liang Yang, while his voice was provided by David Acord, a sound editor for Skywalker Sound.[4]
            His scene in the film, where he shouts "Traitor!" at Finn, led to him quickly becoming an internet sensation shortly after its release. Before his official name was given, fans had labeled the character as "TR-8R." Because of his popularity among fans, FN-2199 became the star of many internet memes.[4]
            In the free-roam mode of LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens, FN-2000 appears on Takodana and is seen mourning FN-2199's passing during the battle. FN-2000 provides the player with a side mission, in which he asks the player to retrieve FN-2199's stun baton, which has been stolen by mercenaries residing on Takodana. Completing that mission awards the player with a gold brick.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/FN-2199</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFN2199</string></dict>
        <key>FN-3181</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.4.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>FN-3181 was a human male stormtrooper who served the First Order. In the year 34 ABY, he was deployed to the planet Jakku as part of a First Order attack on the village of Tuanul in an effort to obtain part of a map showing the location of vanished Jedi Master Luke Skywalker.
            After the stormtroopers killed or captured the village's residents, Kylo Ren, the leader of the Knights of Ren, arrived and executed villager Lor San Tekka. This prompted the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron to try and attack Ren, who used the Force to freeze Dameron. FN-3181 and another trooper then dragged Dameron to Ren and searched the prisoner, before carrying him aboard an Atmospheric Assault Lander to be taken away.
            FN-3181[2] was a human[1] male[2] who served in the FN Corps,[3] a stormtrooper unit in the First Order's military during its conflict with the New Republic–backed Resistance.[2] In the year 34 ABY,[4] he was was one[2] of eighty troopers[5] deployed from the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer[6] to the planet Jakku in four[2] Atmospheric Assault Landers.[6]
            The soldiers were led by Captain Phasma and landed at night
            outside the village of Tuanul, which they had orders to attack in order to obtain part of a map that led to the vanished Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. The village's occupants fought back against FN-3181 and his comrades but were quickly overwhelmed, with those not killed being captured and rounded up into the village's center.[2]
            The Force-sensitive leader of the Knights of Ren, Kylo Ren, then arrived in the village in his[2] Upsilon-class command shuttle,[6] and village resident Lor San Tekka, who had owned the map piece but was no longer in possession of it, was brought before him. The two briefly exchanged words before Ren killed the villager.[2]
            The Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, who had been in the village to meet with San Tekka and had received the map piece, witnessed the man's death from his hiding place and opened fire on Ren in anger. Ren froze both the blaster bolt and Dameron in place using the Force, after which FN-3181 and another trooper ran up to the pilot and grabbed him, each taking an arm and dragging Dameron before Ren.[2]
            Ren had FN-3181 search Dameron,[2] while the other trooper scanned him with a personal scanner.[7] After they found nothing on the pilot, the pair and another trooper escorted Dameron to one of the[2] Atmospheric Assault Landers[6] so that he could be taken back to the[2] Finalizer.[6] However, Dameron no longer had the map piece, as he had given it to his astromech droid, BB-8. The droid escaped from Tuanul and eventually delivered it to the Resistance.[2]
            When FN-3181 searched Poe Dameron, he did so with thuggish delight, smacking the pilot instead of patting him down. When the trooper found nothing, he was disappointed.[7]
            FN-3181 wore standard First Order stormtrooper armor and carried[2] an F-11D blaster rifle.[8]
            FN-3181 first appeared in the 2015 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.[2] The character was portrayed by Michael Giacchino,[2] a long-time musical collaborator of the film's director, J.J. Abrams. Giacchino has provided the musical score for several of Abrams' other works,[9] as well as the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.[10] FN-3181 is not referred to by name in the film itself but is identified in the credits.[2]
            In the novelization of The Force Awakens, written by Alan Dean Foster, FN-3181's actions are slightly altered. After the trooper searches Poe Dameron, the pilot sarcastically compliments him and winks, prompting FN-3181 to kick his legs out from under him.[5]
            In 2018, Giacchino voiced a First Order stormtrooper in the film Ralph Breaks the Internet and later identified the trooper as FN-3181 on Twitter.[11] In the film, FN-3181 and several other First Order stormtroopers discover the heroine Vanellope Von Schweetz in the Oh My Disney website. As Von Schweetz is not allowed on the site, they begin to chase her, but Von Schweetz touches FN-3181 with a video link and sends him to BuzzzTube, causing him to yell the Wilhelm scream. Von Schweetz then hides in a room containing all of the Disney Princesses in order to escape the other stormtroopers.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/FN-3181</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFN3181</string></dict>
        <key>FN-417</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.5.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The First Order stormtrooper FN-417 was one of many deployed to the planet Takodana in 34 ABY to recover the Resistance astromech droid BB-8. As the First Order's forces attacked the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata, where the droid had been sighted, FN-417 moved into the surrounding woods. While being ordered to hold position, the trooper was spotted by the scavenger Rey, an ally of BB-8. After Rey failed to fire an initial shot from her NN-14 blaster pistol due to the weapon's safety still being on, the stormtrooper fired off one shot before being killed by the scavenger.
            FN-417[2] was a human[3] who served in the FN Corps,[4] a stormtrooper unit in the First Order's military during their conflict with the New Republic–backed Resistance.[2] In the year 34 ABY,[1] the trooper was amongst many deployed to the planet Takodana in order to recover the Resistance astromech droid BB-8, who had been sighted in the castle of the pirate Maz Kanata. As the attack on the castle began, FN-417 moved into the surrounding forest but was ordered to hold position via radio.[2]
            Overhearing the order from nearby, the scavenger Rey attempted to shoot the stormtrooper, but failed in her first attempt as the safety of her[2] NN-14 blaster pistol[5] was still on. Before she had another chance to shoot, FN-417 turned and opened fire but missed. Rey then fired off two more shots with her pistol, the second of which hit and killed the trooper; however, she was captured shortly thereafter by First Order forces.[2]
            FN-417 wore standard First Order stormtrooper armor and carried[2] an F-11D blaster rifle.[5]
            FN-417 is portrayed by an uncredited extra in the 2015 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.[2] FN-417's scene was filmed in a forest called Puzzlewood in Wales.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/FN-417</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFN417</string></dict>
        <key>FN-1824</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.6.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>FN-1824[4] was a stormtrooper of the First Order that was assigned to guard Rey, a Force-sensitive scavenger held captive by Kylo Ren aboard Starkiller Base. Using her latent Force abilities, Rey used a Jedi mind trick on FN-1824 to force him into releasing her from captivity. Her first two efforts failed, but she finally successfully used the Jedi ability. FN-1824 freed her from captivity and, on her command, left his blaster rifle behind before leaving her.[2] The stormtrooper was eventually located in his quarters and questioned. He seemed confused and had no memory of what had happened.[5]
            FN-1824 appeared in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, in which he was portrayed by Daniel Craig.[6] In both the film's adult and junior novelizations, when Rey's first attempt at a mind trick fails, the guard simply stares at her. Rey succeeds on her second attempt. Additionally, in the novelizations, Rey instructs the guard to return to his quarters and he also promises to speak of the encounter to no one.[5][7]
            Among the filming crew, the character was dubbed FN-007. The cameo came about as Craig was at Pinewood Studios preparing for his next James Bond film.[8]
            This stormtrooper was nicknamed "JB-007" by fans, referring to Craig's role as James Bond, agent 007.[9][10] In the video game LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens, he is identified as FN-1824. Despite the game being non-canon, story group member Pablo Hidalgo confirmed on Twitter that the names provided by the game for previously unidentified characters, including FN-1824, were considered canon.[11]
            The scene featuring the character in William Shakespeare's The Force Doth Awaken, a retelling of the film The Force Awakens in Shakespearean style, includes nods to Daniel Craig and the James Bond franchise. The first letter of each sentence in his initial dialogue to Rey spells out "Daniel Craig," and in a later line he states "I'll tighten up thy bonds, make thee a specter," a reference to the James Bond film Spectre, which featured Craig as Bond.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/FN-1824</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFN1824</string></dict>
        <key>FN-2003</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.7.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>FN-2003, nicknamed "Slip," was a First Order stormtrooper who served in the decades following the Galactic Civil War. He served under FN-2187 and was considered the weakest link of their group, and his ineptitude was symbolically used in a speech by Captain Phasma to 2187, in which she reinforced that the weakness of individuals contributed to the potential weakness of the First Order as a whole. Despite his failures, Slip continued to serve on the front lines until an assault on the village Tuanul on Jakku, thirty years after the Battle of Endor.
            FN-2003 was a stormtrooper who served in the First Order in the decades after the Galactic Civil War. He frequently fell behind the rest of his team, led by FN-2187, during their training simulations, leading to his nickname of "Slip." FN-2187 often had to rescue Slip in those simulations, including in one where the team assaulted a New Republic bunker with the objective of destroying a heavy repeating blaster. Slip was reprimanded by Captain Phasma after the simulation ended, and Phasma further ordered FN-2187 to stop rescuing Slip. As Phasma explained, Slip was the weakest link and helping him would weaken the First Order. During a strike at Pressy's Tumble, Slip redeemed himself in Phasma's eyes by executing an Abednedo negotiator.[5]
            During a First Order raid on a sacred village on the planet Jakku, Slip was hit by blaster fire from Poe Dameron. FN-2187 went to help his squadmate, but FN-2003's wound proved fatal, Slip wiping his bloody hand on FN-2187's helmet before dying. His sudden and violent death contributed to FN-2187's decision to escape from First Order service.[2][3]
            FN-2003 first appeared in the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens.[3] He was not named in the film itself, only in the novel Before the Awakening, written by Greg Rucka and released the same day as the movie.[5] FN-2003's appearance in The Force Awakens was confirmed in the Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary.[2] He was portrayed by Pip Andersen in the film, listed in the end credits as "Lead Stormtrooper".
            Although FN-2003 was killed by blaster fire from Poe Dameron in the film, in the film's novelization FN-2003 was killed by blaster fire from one of the villagers.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/FN-2003</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFN2003</string></dict>

        <key>DS-181-4</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.10.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>DS-181-4 was the call sign of a Human male starfighter pilot who served the Galactic Empire in the Galactic Civil War. After distinguishing himself during the subjugation of Mon Calamari, DS-181-4 received a promotion to Saber Squadron, part of the 181st Imperial Fighter Group, and flew as Major Turr Phennir's wingman. In 4 ABY, DS-181-4 was present for Sith Lord Darth Vader's arrival aboard the second Death Star, and he later participated in the Battle of Endor.
            The Human male designated by the call sign DS-181-4 was a starfighter pilot in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War.[1] After scoring twelve kills during the subjugation of Mon Calamari,[4] DS-181-4 earned a position in Baron Soontir Fel's Saber Squadron—part of the 181st Imperial Fighter Group[1]—piloting the TIE/IN interceptor Saber 4.[5] Flying as the wingman of Major Turr Phennir,[1] DS-181-4 was often assigned to fly in a reserve position during battle.[5] Preferring to fly in the 181st, DS-181-4 repeatedly refused promotions so that he could remain in the unit.[1]
            Sometime following the Battle of Yavin, DS-181-4 partook in a skirmish against at least one Rebel pilot. He was defeated in the fight but managed to escape in his crippled TIE interceptor. DS-181-4 also participated in battles between Rebel Alliance and Imperial forces in the Naboo, Tatoo, Corellian, Dantooine, and Karthakk systems during the Galactic Civil War. These battles involved an Imperial Lancer-class frigate being pitted against a Rebel EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, with numerous starfighters aiding in the defense or offense of the system.[2]
            In 4 ABY,[3][6] DS-181-4 was present when the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader arrived aboard the second Death Star to discuss the battlestation's lagging construction schedule with the station's commander, Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod. The Sith Lord announced that Emperor Palpatine himself would be arriving to personally oversee the remainder of the Death Star's assembly.[3] DS-181-4 later flew on Phennir's wing during the Battle of Endor,[4] during which Phennir was assigned to protect the Star Destroyer Avenger.[7] The battle ended in an Imperial defeat with the destruction of the Death Star.[8]
            DS-181-4's considerable skill as a TIE pilot earned him a place in the 181st Imperial Fighter Group.[4] Turning down multiple promotions, DS-181-4 preferred to remain as a pilot in the 181st.[1] In battle, DS-181-4 often flew in a reserve position.[5] He had brown hair,[1] brown eyes,[2] and fair skin.[1]
            DS-181-4 wore a black Imperial Navy crewman's uniform during his service in the Empire.[1]
            DS-181-4 first appeared in the opening scene of 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi as an unnamed background character awaiting the arrival of Darth Vader on the second Death Star.[3] The character's name and elements of his backstory were introduced in the Death Star II Limited expansion set of Decipher, Inc.'s Star Wars Customizable Card Game, released in July 2000.[1][5] He later garnered an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, released on December 9, 2008.[4]
            Because part of the scene showing Vader's arrival on the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi was reused in the Special Edition release of The Empire Strikes Back for a scene showing Vader arriving aboard the Super Star Destroyer Executor from Cloud City, the actor who portrayed DS-181-4 can be seen in the Special Edition version of The Empire Strikes Back, alongside other extras who portrayed Imperial officers in Return of the Jedi.[3][9]
            DS-181-4 was added to the 2003 MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided as a non-player character[2] in Game Update 20.[10] Rebel players who requested Tier 7 Duty Missions from certain space stations had a chance to battle an elite Imperial pilot during the mission's boss stage. One of these pilots could be DS-181-4. If the player defeated DS-181-4, the Imperial was not destroyed. Instead, a message was displayed to the player, indicating the successful defeat of the pilot. The player then received a collection icon that added up to award a badge if the player succeeded in destroying all ten of the elite Imperial pilots.[2]
            However, elite Imperial pilots could also be found flying in various space battles, which took place in the Naboo, Tatoo, Corellian, Dantooine, and Karthakk systems. Because DS-181-4 only appeared in the space portion of Star Wars Galaxies, originally added with the Jump to Lightspeed expansion pack, he could normally only be seen inside his respective TIE interceptor. However, a comm display could appear during the battle, displaying DS-181-4's face. In addition, the collection icon depicted DS-181-4's physical appearance. While DS-181-4 piloted a TIE interceptor in the game, there is no indication it was Saber 4. Although players could choose not to participate in any of the battles or collections connected to DS-181-4,[2] this article assumes 100 percent game completion.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/DS-181-4</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDS1814</string></dict>

        <key>Ephraim Bridger</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.13.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ephraim Bridger was a human male revolutionary from the Outer Rim planet of Lothal. He and his wife, Mira, spoke out against the rule of the Galactic Empire by broadcasting revolutionary messages on Lothal, actions that were supported by the planet's governor, Ryder Azadi. As a result of their broadcasts, the Bridgers and Azadi were arrested and imprisoned by the Empire. This left their son, Ezra, to fend for himself on Lothal for nearly a decade. Ezra eventually became part of a rebel cell on Lothal and broadcasted his own message of rebellion to the planet's citizens. This broadcast reached the Imperial prison were Ephraim and Mira were being held, inspiring them to lead a prison revolt. Dozens of prisoners escaped with the Bridgers' help, but Ephraim and Mira were killed during the escape.
            Ephraim Bridger married Mira Bridger and the two had a son, Ezra, who was born on the day that the Galactic Empire was founded. After the Empire took control of their homeworld of Lothal, a planet in the Outer Rim Territories, Ephraim and Mira became revolutionaries[3] in 18 BBY[4] when they began sending out underground broadcasts that spoke out against the Empire's activities on their planet.[3] They were supported by Lothal's governor, Ryder Azadi.[2]
            Their transmissions reached Milo and Lina Graf who eventually made their way to Lothal on their ship the Whisper Bird. Ephraim would subsequently rescue the two as they were making their escape from the Twin Horn Syndicate. He and Mira aided them in deducing the fact that a bounty hunter named The Shade was after the siblings and had actually been manipulating them just earlier before. Together, they concocted a plan to get the bounty hunter off their trail which would allow the siblings to escape Lothal. Unfortunately, the plan failed and the siblings together with their pet Morq and droid CR-8R were captured and flown off. Chastised but not ready to accept defeat yet, Ephraim would contact Ryder Azadi for assistance.[4]
            As a result of their activities, the Empire sent stormtroopers after Ephraim and Mira, and the soldiers took them away to be imprisoned on the charge of treason;[5] Governor Azadi was also arrested for his support of their broadcasts.[2] Tseebo, a Rodian on Lothal who was a close friend of Ephraim and Mira, promised to look after Ezra, but he was too afraid and failed to do so, leaving Ezra to live on his own for several years.[5]
            Years later, while still in prison, Ephraim and Mira learned that Ezra had become part of a rebel cell that fought the Empire on Lothal. He transmitted a message of rebellion to the people of Lothal that reached other worlds in the Outer Rim, and even made its way to the prison where the Bridgers were being held. Ephraim and Mira, who always tried to help their fellow prisoners, could tell that the voice in the broadcast was their son because of his words. They were inspired by what he said and organized a prison break. Dozens of prisoners, including Azadi, were able to escape with their help, but the Bridgers were separated and refused to leave until everyone else had escaped. By the time the others were free, it was too late for Ephraim and Mira—they gave their lives so others could be free.[2]
            While Ephraim and Mira were in captivity, Ezra initially did not want to learn what happened to them, as he believed he would not have been able to survive alone on Lothal if he held out hope that they would return to him. However, he began to learn more after finding Tseebo and learning that the Rodian had volunteered his services to the Imperial Information Office in the hopes of making up for his failure to help the Bridgers. Tseebo wore a device known as the AJ^6 cyborg construct that gave him access to sensitive information, and he learned that the Bridgers had been imprisoned. Ezra did not learn about this initially,[5] but was later told the truth by his Jedi teacher, Kanan Jarrus, and rebel captain Hera Syndulla. This truth coincided with a vision of his parents that led him back to Lothal, which he and the rebels had previously abandoned.[2]
            Once on Lothal, Ezra met Azadi, who returned to find Ezra and tell him what happened to his parents. Ezra was grateful to know the truth, but was nonetheless saddened by the loss of his parents. Ezra had another vision after learning of their fates, where he saw Ephraim and Mira through the Force. They told him they were proud of him and urged him to remain strong. Ezra was confused as to how he could see his parents, but Jarrus told him that Jedi philosophy taught that life did not end at death but merely transformed into something new in the Force. Ephraim and Mira would always be with him.[2]
            One year before the Battle of Yavin, during the Liberation of Lothal, Ezra was welcomed aboard the Chimaera to talk with Emperor Sheev Palpatine about an offer he wanted to make. Attempting to lure the young Padawan to his trap by enter into the remains of the Lothal Jedi Temple, Bridger heard the voice of Ephraim, calling him out. However, Ezra realized that it was just a lie because he sensed his parents' death and turned down Palpatine's offer before calling the purrgil to remove Grand Admiral Thrawn's Imperial forces from Lothal.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ephraim_Bridger</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascEphraimBridger</string></dict>
        <key>Big-Mouth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.14.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"Big-Mouth" was the nickname assumed by a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett. He served as a Clone Corporal in the Grand Army of the Republic in the battalion under the leadership of Jedi General Depa Billaba. Big-Mouth was one of four survivors of the battalion when it suffered ninety percent casualties to Separatist General Grievous during the Battle of Haruun Kal. He and the other three survivors of her battalion, Commander "Grey" Captain "Styles", and Sergeant "Soot," joined her new battalion, and this unit included Billaba's Padawan, Caleb Dume, and clone trooper CT-1157, who would gain the nickname "Stance." During Order 66, Big-Mouth was killed by Dume on the planet Kaller.
            "Big-Mouth" was the nickname[2] assumed by one of the many clones of the bounty hunter Jango Fett created on the planet Kamino to serve as a clone trooper in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic.[1] During the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Clone Corporal Big-Mouth was assigned to the command of the Jedi General Depa Billaba and fought alongside her on[3] the planet[4] Haruun Kal against forces led by the cyborg General Grievous,[3] the Supreme Commander of the Droid Army.[5] The battalion suffered ninety percent causalities,[6] and all but four of the clone troopers serving with Billaba—Big-Mouth himself, Soot, Styles and Grey—were killed.[3] The Jedi herself was injured to the point that she fell into a coma.[6]
            After six months, Billaba awoke and took the youngling Caleb Dume as her padawan learner. The pair were assigned a mission to scout the planet Kardoa for Separatist activity and Clone Commander Gray re-gathered her four surviving colleagues to serve with her again including Big-Mouth, who held the rank of corporal. The commander also managed to have the veteran clones Lieutenant Remo and Corporals Mixx and Kaylon assigned to the battalion under Billaba's command, but was otherwise given inexperienced troopers fresh from Kamino to work with.[3]
            Grey relayed this information the the Jedi and her padawan in a briefing while they camped out on Kardoa's surface. The next morning the operation began and the Republic forces split into five squads to search the canyons of the world. Big-Mouth was part of a team led by Billaba that also included Dume and the clone trooper CT-1157—one of the new troopers whom Big-Mouth kept a close eye on. As they traveled Dume and CT-1157 began joking about the short leash that Billaba and Big-mouth kept them on respectively, earning them disapproving looks from the general and the corporal.[3]
            As the pair joked, Billaba's squad came under attack from Separatist B1 battle droids that had been waiting in ambush, and Billaba ordered Big-Mouth to contact the other squads and request air support. The corporal tried to comply, but found that their signals were being jammed by the Separatists and informed that general that no help was coming. Billaba then ordered Big-Mouth to remain with Dume and keep the battle droids occupied while she slipped away to find the Separatist's command ship. The clone did as ordered, but quickly realized that Dume was fighting too far out in front of the rest of the Republic forces, leaving him exposed.[3]
            The corporal tried to call the Padawan back, but was too late, as a series of blaster bolts struck Dume across the torso and knocked him to the floor. Ignoring Big-Mouth's orders to stay in cover, CT-1157 rushed out to defend his friend, destroying a trio of droids approaching the incapacitated Padawan. Billaba meanwhile had managed to locate the Separatist's shuttle and attacked it, causing the Separatist Colonel Coburn Sear to order a retreat off world so that his forces did not become stranded.[3]
            The battalion's next assignment was to the war-torn world of Mygeeto, where they were tasked with clearing the Southern Mesas of Separatist forces during the Third Battle of Mygeeto. Big-Mouth gave Dume one of his trademark Meilroonuns before being assigned a squad to lead and setting out into the mesas. While he and his men were out in the field, Billaba, Grey, Styles, Dume and CT-1157, who now with the nickname Stance, returned to their camp after being rescued from battle droids by the Mandalorian Skull Squadron, only to be attacked again this time by Grievous and Sear.[7]
            Big-Mouth and the other clones were called back for support, but before they arrived Sear managed to kill Stance, only to in turn be killed himself by Dume. Billaba sustained injuries while fighting Grievous, but was able to hold the cyborg off until the arriving reinforcements forced him to flee. Following the battle a burial service was held for stance and then the clones and Dume visited Billaba while she recovered in a bacta tank. Orders then came in for the battalion to head to the planet Kaller as soon as the general was battle ready.[8]
            On Kaller the Republic's forces engaged Separatist forces under the command of General Kleeve outside Plateau City , eventually routing them once they came close to the city walls. Kleeve and the remaining Separatist forces fled the planet, and after meeting with the Kalleran Gamut Key in Plateau City, Billaba ordered her men to set up camp for the night in the fields outside the city's walls.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Big-Mouth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBigMouth</string></dict>
        <key>Ezra Bridger</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.15.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ezra Bridger, a Force-sensitive human male, was a Jedi Padawan, a freedom fighter, and a revolutionary leader in the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. He was born on Empire Day in 19 BBY to Ephraim and Mira Bridger, whose public criticism of the Empire led to their imprisonment, leaving Bridger an orphan on the planet Lothal as a child. He joined the rebel crew of the Ghost in 5 BBY and was trained in the ways of the Force by Kanan Jarrus. Bridger's abilities grew quickly, and a message of hope he broadcast in the Lothal sector inspired a number of rebel cells to begin working together to fight the Empire.
            In 4 BBY, Bridger learned that his parents were killed while attempting to escape from prison. The young Jedi, already having struggled with his dark side, became more conflicted, coming to a head on the ancient Sith world of Malachor where he recovered a Sith holocron in the hopes of destroying the Sith. He also encountered the former Sith Lord Maul, who hoped to make Bridger his apprentice—particularly once Bridger used the dark side to open the holocron. This briefly strained his apprenticeship with Jarrus, who was blinded by Maul on Malachor, but the two repaired their relationship and continued to progress as Jedi.
            With his powers growing stronger, Bridger took on more leadership roles in the rebellion, including helping Captain CT-7567 "Rex" and a surviving battalion of Separatist Alliance battle droids make peace and bring a sense of closure to the unresolved Clone Wars. Bridger also came into conflict with Grand Admiral Thrawn, helped fellow crewmate Sabine Wren in her quest to reunite the Mandalorian people, and sought to find Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom Bridger believed was key to destroying the Sith.
            In 1 BBY, Bridger managed to free his people from the Empire's control during the liberation of Lothal. Towards the end of the battle, he and Thrawn were taken into hyperspace by the purrgil. This opening allowed the Lothal resistance on the ground to free the planet by destroying the Imperial dome. After the fall of the Empire, Wren and Ahsoka Tano set off on a journey to find Bridger and bring him home.
            Ezra Bridger was born in 3258 LY,[1] on the day of the inception of the Galactic Empire,[13][3] and grew up on the planet Lothal in the Outer Rim Territories. Hoping to make the galaxy a better place for him, his parents Mira and Ephraim Bridger set up public broadcasting transmissions to speak out against the Empire's harsh rule[1] in 14 BBY,[14] however this would cost them their own lives. By 12 BBY, his parents were found and taken away by the Empire,[1] leaving Ezra to live largely on his own for the next eight years and find work as a con artist and thief, stealing technology and reselling it on the black market, while unknowingly using the Force to occasionally get himself out of tough situations.[13][15] Eventually, he would come to live in the abandoned LothalNet comm tower E-272, where he would keep a collection of stormtrooper helmets.[15][16][17]
            Bridger would later be apprenticed to a Xexto, Ferpil Wallaway, owner of a pawn shop in Lothal, and skilled pickpocket who had various underworld connections. The Xexto taught the boy everything he knew, and they would try to pick each other clean for fun. The boy worked for him, doing jobs like scamming wealthy-looking tourists and trick them and selling them stuff. Bridger would also befriend Moreena Krai, a girl of the same age as him, who knew of his under-handed skills.[17]
            One day at Capital City's spaceport, Bridger was selling tickets for a Gladiator Night between a Houk and Feeorin when Krai told him her family and her were leaving for Alderaan to live with her grandmother due to the Empire, and bade farewell to the boy. Later that day, Bridger caught sight of the Hound's Tooth and met Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk, who hired him as a guide to Ake's Tavern. As they reached their destination, Bossk sent Bridger instead to lure his prey, Gronson "Shifty" Takkaro, out; soon enough, however, a confrontation between Bossk and the assassins Angrigo and the Kratchell twins ensued, in which Bridger stunned Takkaro, and Bossk killed the assassins, only for Imperial authorities to surround them. Aware of a likely set-up by Lieutenant Herdringer, Bossk was forced to leave Takkaro and follow Bridger, and the two escaped from the Imperials on a speeder bike. During their escape, however, Bossk was injured and convinced Bridger to help him by offering the boy all the content of his strongbox onboard the Tooth.[17]
            In the course of an hour, Bridger took the Trandoshan to his tower and tended to his wounds, before the bounty hunter woke up, "disguised" himself as a blind Trandoshan and almost immediately prompted Bridger into leading him to a posting agency at the spaceport, where he accessed the Imperial Enforcement DataCore to check records on Herdringer. However, they discovered Herdringer had been dead for months, and Bossk surmised that his replacement, Jenkes, had been the one to set him up, now also aware that he and Takkaro had worked together in gladiator arena in Nyriaan years before. Their search, though, attracted Jenkes' attention, who sent troopers to attack them, but Bridger and Bossk managed to slip away again, and they went to Wallaway's pawn shop, where they saw from afar as Jenkes shot Wallaway and took his money.[17]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ezra_Bridger</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascEzraBridger</string></dict>
        <key>Brom Titus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.16.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brom Titus was a human male who served as an admiral and later as a commander in the Galactic Empire's navy. A few years prior to the Battle of Yavin, Titus was in command of the Imperial Interdictor, an experimental Interdictor vessel that the Empire was testing in the Del Zennis system, using the ship's gravity well projectors to pull rebel ships out of hyperspace. Titus managed to capture the Phoenix Cell's Commander Jun Sato and Jedi-in-training Ezra Bridger, however they were rescued by Jedi Padawan Kanan Jarrus and Captain Rex, who disguised themselves as stormtroopers. The rebels destroyed the Interdictor by adjusting the gravity well projectors to pull in every ship nearby when activated, even the Arquitens-class command cruisers, however Titus got away in an escape pod before the ship's destruction.
            Following this failure, he was demoted to commander and placed in command of Reklam Station, which was later destroyed by Ezra, after the Phoenix Squadron stole several Y-wing starfighters from the station. Later on, he was placed in command of the Marauder, an Arquitens-class command cruiser. Titus and his ship arrived at the Jalindi relay just as a rebel strike team, composed of Ezra, Chopper and Sabine Wren, were attempting to hack it. During the skirmish that followed, Titus was killed and his ship destroyed when Saw Gerrera and Edrio arrived and blew up the relay.
            Brom Titus was an Admiral in the Imperial Navy who commanded the Imperial Interdictor, an experimental starship equipped with four gravity well projectors capable of pulling starships out of hyperspace. Following Imperial protocol, Titus kept his warship in the Del Zennis system, which was classified as an Imperial test zone. On one occasion, Titus' Imperial Interdictor intercepted a patrol from Phoenix Cell, which was part of a wider rebel network that resisted the Galactic Empire.[2]
            In response, the squadron's leader, Commander Jun Sato, traveled on the CR90 corvette Liberator to investigate the disappearance of that rebel patrol. Sato was accompanied by the young Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger, who had been sent by Hera Syndulla to help Sato with his mission. Sensing Sato's ship, Titus' Imperial Interdictor pulled the rebel corvette out of hyperspace. After disabling the ship's systems, the Interdictor pulled the Liberator into its ventral hangar bay, where the crew were captured by Titus' stormtroopers.[2]
            Admiral Titus then ordered his stormtroopers to bring Commander Sato and Ezra to the Interdictor's command bridge. Sato tried to bluff his way out of trouble by claiming that he and his crew were from the Corporate Alliance, and lambasted the Admiral for illegally detaining them. Titus however, was not daunted by Sato's charade and put him in place by recognizing him as the commander of a growing rebel cell. Titus then turned his attention to Ezra, who claimed that he was Jabba the Hutt. Titus was incredulous of the boy's claims, and stated that, thanks to the chosen alias, he recognized him as none other than Ezra Bridger. Titus then ordered his men to take the prisoners to secure holding cells.[2]
            The Admiral then used a hologram to inform the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus that he had captured Commander Sato and Bridger. Kallus, who had encountered Ezra on numerous occasions, warned Titus to lock him in a secure holding cell with triple guard. Despite Kallus' warnings, Titus refused to believe that a young boy could pose a threat to the Imperial Navy. Unknown to Titus, the rebels Kanan Jarrus, Rex, and Chopper had infiltrated the Imperial Interdictor disguised as stormtroopers and an Imperial communications droid respectively. Meanwhile, Bridger managed to overpower his captors and lock them in his cell.[2]
            Upon learning that Ezra had escaped, Admiral Titus ordered his crew to lock down all levels of the Imperial Interdictor and to secure the ship's hangar bays. He also gave his men permission to kill Bridger on sight, not wanting to prove that Agent Kallus was right about not underestimating him. The Admiral's problems were further complicated when he received word from his men that other attackers were impersonating security personnel, and that the rebels had also infiltrated the reactor core controlling the gravity well projectors. Despite their difficulties, Titus' stormtroopers managed to capture one prisoner, whom the Admiral recognized as a clone trooper. He learned Rex's identity after having his number scanned.[2]
            Admiral Titus had Rex brought to the command bridge, where he attempted to make a deal with Captain. He praised Rex and his kind for bringing peace to the galaxy, and expressed disappointment that the former clone was working with the rebellion. The Admiral then offered to grant Rex immunity and reinstatement at an Imperial training academy if he convinced his rebel compatriots to surrender. However, Rex refused to make any deals with the Empire. In response, Titus ordered two of his stormtroopers to hold down the prisoner while an Imperial interrogation droid tortured the Clone veteran.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brom_Titus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBromTitus</string></dict>
        <key>Klaus Vandangante</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.17.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Klaus Vandangante, better known as Doc, was a well known Human male outlaw tech who was operating in the Corporate Sector during the early career of the famed smuggler Han Solo.
            Doc was born on Coruscant to Carmilla Vandangante, a corporate viceprex and widow who doted on her only son. He rebelled against his life of luxury and privilege at the age of seven, reprogramming his droid nanny to discard such unpalatable foods as kibla greens, flangth, and stewed gwouch into a living room vase. This demonstrated his technical gifts to his tutors, who soon tailored their lessons to these skills.[1]
            Upon graduation, Doc accepted a position at Alkherrodyne Propulsions as design systems team leader. He soon became disenchanted with the corporation's shoddy workmanship covered with flashy marketing, but swallowed his pride and remained with the company. However, when the Azaria 66 began exploding in minor accidents, Alkherrodyne's slicers framed Doc. The countless lawsuits wiped out the multi-billion credit Vandangante fortune, and left the name slandered.[1]
            Doc became a drifter, eventually making his way into the Corporate Sector, where he met an outlaw tech by the name of Shardra. They immediately fell in love, and when introduced to her profession, Doc found his calling, repairing smuggling ships and souping them up to be some of the fastest in the Corporate Sector. Shardra bore the couple a daughter, Jessa Vandangante, but soon died in an unfortunate fuel dump explosion. Doc found raising a daughter to be a difficult task, especially as the free-spirited woman grew older and started catching the eye of younger smugglers like Han Solo.[1]
            The Corporate Sector Authority eventually managed to capture Doc, and placed him in their Stars' End prison facility. He was rescued by Solo when the smuggler broke into the facility to free him, his first mate Chewbacca, and several other prisoners.[2][1]
            Doc returned to the business, and was still working several months after the Battle of Yavin, when Cynabar's InfoNet informed readers that Doc had changed locations and would be notifying his regulars shortly thereafter.[4] After moving, Sarvel Tal-Oldra took over his former location and began producing suits of Juggernaut 510 Combat Power Armor.[5]
            The entry on Lafrarians in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia mistakenly says that Doc was a Lafrarian.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Klaus_Vandangante</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKlausVandangante</string></dict>
        <key>Tor Vizsla</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.18.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tor Vizsla was a male Human Mandalorian warrior and the first leader of the Death Watch faction during the Mandalorian Civil War. He founded the splinter group following Jaster Mereel's ascension to Mandalore—leader of the Mandalorians—in 60 BBY in direct competition against Mereel's promulgation of the Supercommando Codex. While Mereel sought to root out what he saw as immoral banditry that had taken hold among the Mandalorians, Vizsla wished to continue their marauding ways, with the ultimate goal of starting a new Mandalorian War and conquering the galaxy in the name of his forefathers. To this end, he and his supporters waged war against Mereel's True Mandalorians for several years, with heavy casualties on both sides, until Vizsla was seemingly killed on Concord Dawn.
            Vizsla and the Death Watch later reappeared on Korda Six where he managed to trap the True Mandalorians and kill Mereel as the Mandalore was betrayed by his second-in-command, forcing the True Mandalorians to retreat. After several more years in hiding, he laid another trap for the True Mandalorians and Mereel's successor, Jango Fett, in which a strike team of Jedi were manipulated into slaughtering Vizsla's enemies for him. The only survivor of the battle, Fett was sold into slavery and spent several years aboard a spice transport. He managed to escape, however, and recovered a suit of Mandalorian armor from Galidraan. Fett then hunted Vizsla to Corellia where Fett destroyed Vizsla's ship, the Death Rattle, and fought Vizsla hand-to-hand on the planet's surface. Vizsla injected Fett with a poison to knock him out, but before he lost consciousness, Fett slashed open Vizsla's stomach. Attracted by the scent of blood, a pack of dire-cats attacked, killing and devouring Vizsla, leaving Fett to wake up the following day, unharmed.
            Tor Vizsla was a Human male member of the Mandalorian Clan Vizsla.[4] In 60 BBY, Jaster Mereel took the title of Mandalore, claiming leadership over the Mandalorian clans that still followed their traditional warrior culture.[3][5] He instituted his Supercommando Codex as a new moral standard for all Mandalorians to follow, asserting that Mandalorians should conduct themselves honorably as nothing more than highly-paid mercenaries rather than conquerors.[1][3] He also hoped to eliminate the public perception of Mandalorians as amoral killers.[6] Vizsla opposed this reform, however, and sought the title of Mandalore for himself. He advocated the belief that the Mandalorians should return to their roots as conquerors, claiming that it was their birthright to wage a second war for control of the galaxy,[3] and destroy the hated pacifist regime of the New Mandalorians.[7] Gathering like-minded Mandalorian hardliners to his cause, he led a violent coup against Mereel's supporters and formed a splinter group which he cast as the Death Watch, adapting his clan sigil to symbolize the movement.[1][4]
            Scattering Mereel and his men on Concord Dawn in 58 BBY, Vizsla's forces hunted them across the planet. Finding a young Jango Fett working in his father's fields, Vizsla questioned the boy while his companion held him at gunpoint. Learning that Jango's father had been sheltering Mereel, Vizsla brutally interrogated the Journeyman Protector. When he refused to talk, Vizsla had one of his men put a blaster to his son's head, threatening to kill the boy if the elder Fett didn't cooperate. Before any harm could come to her son, Jango Fett's mother shot and killed the Death Watchman holding him. The elder Fett urged him to run and the boy ran for the fields with several of Vizsla's men in pursuit. As they caught up to the young Fett, he was saved by Mereel and his remaining followers. Hearing the ensuing firefight in the fields, Vizsla ordered his men to burn them while they murdered Jango's parents and kidnapped his sister.[8] Confident the fire had finished off his nemesis, the Death Watch settled in for two days of rest and recreation to celebrate their victory in a nearby town. There, they came under attack from Mereel and what remained of his army. During the battle, Vizsla took cover inside his tank and Jango placed an explosive on its underside. When the explosion cleared, Mereel searched the debris and, though no body was found, Vizsla was presumed dead.[1]
            However, Vizsla was encountered alive in 52 BBY, albeit extensively scarred by the explosion. Luring the True Mandalorians into an ambush on Korda Six, the Death Watch decimated more of Mereel's forces with help from the native Kordans.[6] Vizsla appeared on the battlefield aboard a tank and gunned Mereel down himself when the Mandalore was abandoned by his own second-in-command, Montross—who sought leadership of the Mandalorians for himself. When the True Mandalorians retreated, leadership passed to Jango Fett who swore to hunt down Vizsla once and for all.[1]
            When the governor of Galidraan agreed to pass information about the Death Watch's whereabouts on to Jango Fett in exchange for his Mandalorians putting down a rebellion in 44 BBY, Vizsla set yet another trap for his foes. He coerced the governor into requesting help from the Jedi Order,[6] claiming the Mandalorians were slaughtering political activists.

        <key>Pedrin Gaul</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.19.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cadet Pedrin Gaul was a human male who flew as a Rebel pilot in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, operating under the callsign "Red Five". He was once a transport pilot before helping fugitives who were hunted by the Galactic Empire escape from Denon, for which he was branded a traitor of the Empire. He was killed in action while flying his T-65 X-wing starfighter for the Alliance during the Battle of Scarif. Gaul's callsign was later taken by Luke Skywalker, who destroyed the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin.
            Pedrin Gaul hailed from the planet Denon and was born some time prior to the Galactic Civil War. On his homeworld, he was a transport pilot and ferried both passengers and freight throughout the metropolitan skylanes of Denon. He remained in this career until he helped fugitives who were hunted by the Galactic Empire escape from Denon. For his actions in this exodus, the Empire branded Gaul a traitor and he fled his homeworld.[1]
            Gaul joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, became a cadet in the Alliance Fleet, and was stationed at the Great Temple on Yavin 4. He flew a T-65B X-wing starfighter for Red Squadron and was given the callsign Red Five.[1] Gaul flew with his squadron during the Battle of Scarif, where they and the rest of the Alliance Fleet provided support for Jyn Erso and her team, Rogue One, as they fought to steal the plans to the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death Star. Gaul was killed in action during the battle, as the Alliance attempted to destroy the Shield Gate that protected Scarif and, for a time, prevented Rogue One from transmitting the Death Star plans to the Alliance Fleet. The plans were ultimately transmitted and given to Princess Leia Organa.[2]
            Upon the moment of Gaul's death, Admiral Raddus could hear his anguished scream over the starfighter's frequency.[3]
            The Red Five callsign was left vacant as a result of Gaul's death. Not long after the Battle of Scarif, aspiring Jedi Luke Skywalker helped Princess Leia bring the plans stolen from Scarif to Yavin 4. The Alliance found the weakness built into the battle station by its designer,[4] Galen Erso,[2] and launched the Battle of Yavin to destroy the Death Star. Skywalker flew under the Red Five callsign and fired the shot that destroyed the Death Star, honoring the sacrifice of Pedrin Gaul and all those who died on Scarif.[4]
            Base One's Fighter Boss Nera Kase considered him to be both awkward and eager.[5]
            When Gaul was under attack, he called for help, saying he could not shake the TIE fighters.[2]
            Pedrin Gaul was created for the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.[2] His backstory was fleshed out in the reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, by Lucasfilm Story Group creative executive Pablo Hidalgo.[1]
            He was portrayed by stunt performer David Forman,[6] according to Hidalgo.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pedrin_Gaul</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPedrinGaul</string></dict>

        <key>Darbin Sull</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.21.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darbin Sull was a male Human Corellian who was a promising politician and one of the youngest individuals to be elected by the Corellian Council during the Galactic War. During the war, Darbin was utterly ambitious and when he was approached by agents of Imperial Intelligence, they secretly recruited him, promising the post of prime minister once the Imperials seized power. Likewise, the Empire soon had the entire Corellian Council in its pocket and send troops on the planet. However much to Darbin's surprise, many Corellian groups and common citizens put up a stiff resistance against the Sith Empire.
            When the Jedi and Galactic Republic troops engaged in the Battle of Corellia against the Sith and their Corellian allies, Darbin Sull chose to side with the Empire in hopes of being elected prime minister.
            Sull joined a hero team in a holographic conference with Darth Decimus in Labor Valley. The hero had already cleared out the resistance on the surface and destroyed their supplies, forcing them into the Selonian tunnels. Sull warned that the Selonians were extremely vicious and not to be underestimated.
            After the Imperials set off on a genocide campaign against the Selonians, the focus of the hero moved onto Axial Park. Sull was to serve a role of the hero's "prisoner", who was to "escape" and infiltrate the Republic. The hero also decided to give Sull a slight bruise to make the deception look convincing. Unfortunately for Sull, the Republic suspected him of being an Imperial spy, so to get into their good graces, he informed them of the Imperials attempting to kill Jedi Master Corin Tok. He managed to warn the hero before the ambush, but was reprimanded for the slip-up.
            The final area for the Empire to capture was Capitol Square of the Coronet City, where the Green Jedi were the last form of resistance and had sealed themselves within the Green Jedi Enclave. Sull had managed to acquire one access code for the hero to enter, but couldn't grab another without blowing his cover. He informed his allies that all but one Green Jedi have sought haven in the enclave, except for Master Bedoch, who was trying to hold Republic Foundation Museum. The hero sacked the museum and killed Bedoch, taking his access code.
            Once all the pieces were in place to take the Green Jedi out, Sull charmed his way into the enclave to distract the Green Jedi Council. As the hero made the way inside, Sull offered to distract the Jedi, even though he'd be blowing his cover, which his allies approved. Once the Green Jedi were all killed, the hero and Darbin Sull reported to Darth Decimus of their success. Sull tried reminding the Dark Councilor of their prior agreement to give him the post of the Prime Minister. Decimus admitted that he could imagine Corellia rebuilding under Sull's leadership, however, he felt that rebellion would only rise again if that came to pass. Agreeing with the Sith Lord, the Imperial hero decided to kill Sull and struck him down just as his dreams were closest to being realized.
            The player can choose whether to kill Sull or spare him. If spared, Sull will be present at Corellia's inauguration into the Empire and be proudly granted the title of Prime Minister. He then urges his fellow councilors to bow before the hero. However, Councilor Jalta defiantly refuses. Angered, Sull demands the hero to kill him. The player can choose to kill Jalta (dark side option) or spare him (light side option).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darbin_Sull</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarbinSull</string></dict>

He was appointed to his position by Onara Kuat, head of the Kuat family and principal director of Kuat Drive Yards.
            Grim and humorless, Danu was among the Senators that opposed Chancellor Palpatine's growing emergency powers. This brought him into conflict with many people on Kuat, who benefited from increased production in Kuat's shipyards during the Clone Wars. His opposition to increased militarization led him to be twice nearly recalled from office by Onara Kuat and the Kuati electorate.
            Danu was one of the Senators that met Palpatine at the Republic Executive Building after the Chancellor was rescued from General Grievous' flagship by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.[2]
            The Senator had good ties with the Jedi and greatly respected their Order, believing the nascent rebellion being led by Mon Mothma and Bail Prestor Organa needed the support of the Jedi in order to succeed. Danu, following Mothma and Organa's lead, became part of the Delegation of 2000, although he did not accompany the group when their petition was rejected by Palpatine.
            Standing 1.96 meters,[1] Danu was taller than the average Human.[3] He often wore a white ceremonial dress that resembled the garb of the Kuati Security Forces.[4]
            Giddean Danu was played by Christopher Kirby in scenes deleted from the final release of Revenge of the Sith.
            What's The Story? author Aidan Hennessy intended to state him being mayor of Kuat City prior to becoming senator (a reference to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad).

In 22 BBY, he and his clanmates received lightsaber training from Jedi Grand Master Yoda in the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant. The lesson was interrupted by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who sought Yoda's help in locating the planet Kamino. The Grand Master opened up the question of why the planet might be missing from the Jedi Archives to the class, and Burtola answered that it must have been erased by someone.
            J. K. Burtola was a Force-sensitive human male[2] who was born at some point between 30 BBY and 26 BBY.[1] As a young child he became a member of the Jedi Order's Bear Clan[3] of younglings and trained in the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant.[2] In 22 BBY,[4] Burtola and the rest of the Bear Clan were practicing with training lightsabers under the tutelage of Jedi Grand Master Yoda in one of the temple's classrooms when the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi interrupted the lesson to seek Yoda's guidance.[2]
            Yoda halted the class, and Burtola and the others greeted Kenobi, who explained that he was looking for the planet Kamino, but could not find it in the Jedi Archives. Yoda asked Burtola's classmate Liam to lower the classroom's blinds so that Kenobi could show the class a holographic star map and indicate where the planet should be. The Grand Master then asked the class if they had any thoughts on why the planet might be missing, and Burtola suggested that it might have been erased from the archives. Satisfied with this answer, Yoda moved away from the younglings to speak briefly with Kenobi about this troubling idea.[2]
            Burtola was Force-sensitive and had fair skin, brown eyes and brown hair.[2]
            Burtola wore brown Jedi robes, a brown belt and a gray training helmet while at the temple and used a practice lightsaber.[2]

        <key>Dareg</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.28.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dareg was a male Human who was one of the leaders of the Mantellian Separatist Movement and the head of the Separatist Stronghold inside Mount Avilatan, an active volcano on Avilatan island, Ord Mantell during the Cold War. Dareg despised alien species.
            A Human male who lived during period of the Cold war, Dareg's family inhereited a droid at some point. The droid contained records of credits legally owed to House Teraan, a Royal family on Alderaan who lost the droid to pirates, though how much he knew about the droid's true nature is unclear. Dareg lived on Ord Mantell and grew disillusioned with the Galactic Republic and the Ord Mantell Central Authority because of the corruption and what he felt was the oppression of the people of Ord Mantell. He joined the Mantellian Separatist Movement and would become a prominent leader of the Movement.
            During the Separatist War Dareg would command a legion of troops in a Separatist stronghold established in the heart of Mount Avilatan, which was a volcano was known to have secret dealings with Skavak; at one time Dareg scheduled a meeting with Skavak for the shipment of blasters originally intended for the Crime lord Rogun the Butcher, while Syreena would warn Dareg of a smuggler, who was after Skavak for a ship Skavak stole. Instead, Skavak betrayed him and his movement to steel the droid Dareg inherited, which bewildered Morant, who had only been with Dareg a few months, as he considered the droid ancient and worthless. By the time the smuggler infiltrated the Separatist base and confronted Dareg and his men Skavak was already gone. Dareg attacked the smuggler in retaliation but was killed instead, leaving Morant alive to tell where Skavak was instead. The smuggler would continue to pursue Skavak, but he fled to Coruscant before the smuggler could apprehend him.
            A muscular Human with brown hair and eyes, Dareg held a fanatical view of the Separatist Movement, considering his members courageous "brothers in arms" and "executioners of justice" for the people of Ord Mantell that he felt were oppressed by their corrupt planetary government. Viidu, on the other hand, considered him a psychopath.
            Dareg wasn't willing to negotiate with the Smuggler for the location of Skavak because of the members killed that Morant felt would have been avoided if he just told the truth about Skavak's betrayal.
            Dareg first appears in the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic as a enemny Boss NPC as part of the Smuggler storyline that the player has to kill to proceed then talk to Morant.

He was a sworn rival of Nok Drayen before his "death". He was killed in a confrontation with the Jedi Nariel Pridence, the Sith Vaverone Zare, and the Smuggler Ace.[1]
            Before the Treaty of Coruscant, Diago Hixan once competed with the infamous Nok Drayen to rule the galactic underworld. Their rivalry spanned many years and countless worlds as they scored bigger heists and hunted rarer treasures, punctuated by the occasional spat of violence. Diago Hixan claimed victory after Nok Drayen died, bringing many cunning and merciless criminals throughout the galaxy under his heel. In his prime, one of Diago Hixan's greatest treasures was the beautiful Shassa Dalle. To his dismay, she was eventually "stolen" by none other than Nok Drayen. For years, Diago Hixan made many impassioned attempts to take her back from his rival, but his pursuit ended after he accidentally caused Shassa's death.
            In 3643 BBY, a smuggler captain came to Tatooine to acquire a sensor computer from Diago to assist in finding the lost treasure of Nok. The smuggler had contacted Diago's lieutenant, Tookreek, to arrange a meeting with Diago in exchange for being known for finding the treasure. However, a Sith named Vaverone Zare was seeking a meeting with Diago too, mainly to acquire the holocron of Darth Nihilus he possessed, and had launched attacks on his holdings to get his attention. What's more was that Zare had to contend with Jedi Knight Nariel Pridence.
            When all parties arrived at Diago's hideout in the Lightspring, Diago refused hear any of them. At the same time, the smuggler's companion, Risha called via holo to check on her partner's progress. Diago quickly became englamoured with her, compelling her to sign off. He demanded that he meet her. Zare interrupted him, attempting to persuade him to help her kill Nariel but he would not hear her. Zare then attempted to use a mind trick on the smuggler to turn on the Jedi but the latter proved strong willed for it to work. To add to the madness, Diago irrationally ordered his droids to attack all present. In the ensuring fight, Diago was killed, along with Zare.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diago_Hixan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDiagoHixan</string></dict>
        <key>Bardan Jusik</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.30.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bardan Jusik, later known as Bardan Skirata, and even later Gotab, was a Human male Jedi Padawan who served the Jedi Order as the apprentice of Master Arligan Zey during the Republic Classic era. He was also a Commander at the time of the Clone Wars and aided in briefing clone commandos before a mission. He was against the creation of the Grand Army of the Republic and even addressed his negative ideas to the Jedi Council. He was later promoted to Jedi Knight and became a General in the Grand Army of the Republic. He later resigned from the Order to join the Mandalorians, saying that he couldn't fight for a Council that approved the slave labor that was the Grand Army.
            As custom with Jedi initiates, Bardan Jusik was brought to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant when he was very young. Unable to remember his parents, he grew up amongst the Jedi, eventually coming under the training of Master Zey. He had once told Ordo Skirata that he remembered being taken from his parents, but not them.
            Three months after the First Battle of Geonosis, Padawan Jusik helped brief and equip Omega Squad for their mission to Qiilura, where they were tasked to destroy a Separatist nano-virus facility and kidnap the scientist Ovolot Qail Uthan. At the time Jusik was very unfamiliar with clones looking all the same, and kept staring at them during the squads preparations. This was the first time Jusik had come in contact with Omega Squad. But after he briefed them for the mission, Jusik had little to no influence on the mission.
            Jusik took a liking to a Null ARC Trooper named Ordo, and respected him as a soldier. Because of his rapport with Ordo, Kal Skirata selected him to be part of a black ops team whose mission was to neutralize CIS terrorist cells operating on Coruscant. For this mission, Bardan would work with Skirata himself, Ordo, Null ARC trooper Mereel, Delta Squad, Omega Squad, Mandalorian warrior Walon Vau, and fellow Jedi Etain Tur-Mukan.
            Throughout the course of the operation, Bardan grew steadily closer to the clones and Skirata, the former often referring to him as "vod'ika" (an affectionate form of the Mando'a word for "little brother"), and the latter often calling him "Bard'ika" (Mando'a for "Little Bardan", expressing fatherly affection). By the end of their mission, he had been accepted into the fold as a Mandalorian warrior, even donning borrowed Mandalorian armor from Kal Skirata for the final battle with the terrorists. The armor was Munin Skirata's green armor, with green meaning duty.
            Bardan fought the terrorists valiantly and he and his comrades won the day. Following the battle, he knew that his affinity for the Mandalorian culture would be viewed by the Jedi Council as attachment, but he did not see it in the same light. He decided that if he were asked to choose, he would be Mando.
            Bardan would continue to serve in the GAR, leading troops on several fronts until he was assigned to track Ko Sai with Delta. He mind-wiped a worker in the process of searching for Ko Sai, though he was forced to blow the mission in order to allow Skirata to get to Sai first. After being confronted with increasing amounts of evidence pointing to clone executions by the Republic, Bardan declared to Zey that he would follow his heart; that of a Jedi's, and protect innocents. By doing this he resigned from the Order, stating he couldn't betray his men to death. Zey was sorry to see him go, but allowed him to keep his lightsaber.
            Bardan donned Mandalorian Beskar'gam and joined Clan Skirata. After Order 66 was implemented, he moved to Kyrimorut with Kal Skirata. Three weeks after Order 66, Jusik and Ordo discovered that the Imperial Army were building their garrison in an abandoned theme park in the shape of a Mythosaur, believing it was an old Mandalorian temple of great power based on the word of the former owner's brother. Jusik showed great doubt about bringing Jedi to Mandalore, but Ordo agreed with Kal that the Jedi Kina Ha's genetic information on the clone troopers was far too valuable to pass up.
            While in a bar where they met the brother of the park's former owner, they were worried about taking off their helmets. However, the bar owner told them they looked after their own. They also saw Death Watch members Dred Priest and his girlfriend Isabet Reau in the bar, knowing that Mij Gilamar wouldn't be happy to learn Priest was on Mandalore.
            After Kina Ha and Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy arrived, Jusik asked Kina Ha about how she was born. Kina replied by saying she was engineered for deep-space missions and that her life was prolonged immensely, revealing she was over a thousand years old. She also said that she was naturally Force-sensitive; this amazed Jusik, as the Jedi had never heard of a Kaminoan Jedi before. A few days later, he showed Kad a picture of Darman, reminding him that his daddy would be home soon. He and Mij both agreed that Kad would have to keep his powers under wraps in order to not attract Imperial attention. During this time he also begins to wonder if he could heal Arla Fett's brain of mental problems, since he healed Fi's brain using the Force. They began by taking blood samples to discover exactly what drugs she was being pumped full of and whether they affect her mental stability or not.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bardan_Jusik</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBardanJusik</string></dict>
        <key>Jun Seros  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.31.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jun Seros was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as the Order's battlemaster during the Great Galactic War and the ensuing Cold War. Famed for both his skills with a lightsaber and his unending loyalty to the Jedi and the Republic, he was one of the Jedi Order's leading lights and Masters during the War and the Cold War that followed.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Jun Seros was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, serving as a Jedi Knight for over a decade. Mastering the arts of warfare along with lightsaber combat without ever striking a blow with an intent to harm. When the reconstituted Sith Empire returned from the Unknown Regions and waged a war across the entire galaxy, Seros was appointed Jedi Master and recognizing the threat, he took his weapon in earnest for the first time in his life. Unlike some of his peers, Seros did not shy away from the war and acted as a general in the Republic Military's armed forces. The Jedi High Council appointed Seros the Order's battlemaster, allowing Seros to train hundreds of Jedi in the field. His strategic genius and bold interventions left him undefeated on every front that he had led.[3][2]
            The war ultimately ended during the Sacking of Coruscant by the Sith. Forced to sign the Treaty of Coruscant, the Republic's decision was seen as foolishness by Seros, who vocally opposed to honor the document.[1]
            During the time of the Cold War, he continued to war against trusting the Sith to honor the terms of the treaty in the following years.[3] In this era, he served as a vital aide to Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus, coming to form a good friendship which he later used to persecute a rising bounty hunter known as the Grand Champion of the Great Hunt.[1]
            Another old friend of Seros's was Jedi Master Kellian Jarro, a famed warrior who personally slew one hundred Mandalorians during the Sacking of Coruscant. Jarro's actions during the sacking earned him the hatred of the Mandalorians, who placed a price on his head. Jarro was later made the final target of the Great Hunt, and the bounty was finally claimed by the competition's champion. Seros, however, began a witch-hunt for the murderer of his old friend.[1]
            Seros first attempted a trap on Quesh, luring the Hunter with a false endorsement from Adascorp. The Hunter, ever the mercenary, arrived, only to learn of the trap and was surrounded by SIS agents. Seros was observing via hologram as the Hunter slaughtered the entire strike team. Seros cryptically promised that he's not done, but the Hunter did not take him seriously and terminates the communication.[1]
            Seros later sent another team led by Adeline Marr to Nar Shaddaa in search of the Hunter. The team confronted the other Grand Champions, Bloodworthy, Jewl'a Nightbringer and Defenestrator, who planning on hosting a party to celebrate the Hunter's successful Blacklist bounties, but the Champions refused to give up their comrade's whereabouts. The trio were slaughtered, just as the Hunter had arrived. Seros, again, was monitoring via hologram and offered the Hunter a last chance to surrender. His terms were refused and the Hunter killed the entire team before swearing to track Seros down and kill him. Seros was unintimidated and vowed that he would make the Hunter regret defying him.[1]
            Following this, Seros framed the Hunter for a mile-long list of false crimes, making the Hunter the Republic's Most Wanted, in an effort to expose the Sith's true colors. Every bounty hunter in the galaxy began gunning for the million credit bounty on the Hunter's head while the Empire severed all ties with the Hunter. But soon afterwards, the Hunter was hired by Darth Tormen, who offered the chance for revenge against Seros and Janarus, who publicly condemned the Hunter.[1]
            The Hunter aided Tormen in subjugating Corellia by capturing rebel leaders and forcing them to sign a treaty dictating Corellia's succession from the Republic. Master Seros knew the treaty was a sham to draw the Supreme Chancellor from Coruscant to ratify it and convinced Janarus that he could rally the Green Jedi against the Sith invasion of the planet. He later encountered his quarry on the same planet. Instead of calling on his fellow Jedi to assist him in arresting the mercenary, he sent them away. He and the Hunter exchanged words before engaging in battle. Despite his skill in the Force, Seros was defeated. As he lay dying, Seros boasted that while he may have failed to arrest the Hunter, he'd at least distracted the Hunter while his compatriots rescued Darth Tormen's captives and tear up his sham treaty. However, he was mistaken, as Tormen slaughtered the entire team of Green Jedi. However, the Hunter refused to let him have the last laugh, revealing that all this was not just to kill him, but to get to the Supreme Chancellor and they both walked into a trap. Realizing what he had done, Seros attempted to rise to his feet, only for the Hunter to kill him.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jun_Seros_(Jedi)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJunSeros</string></dict>
        <key>Jan Dodonna</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.32.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jan Dodonna was a Commenor-born soldier who served both Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire. He was one of the first captains of a Star Destroyer in the last days of the Galactic Republic, having served in both the Stark Hyperspace War and the Clone Wars. Following his defection in 1 BBY, he became one of the first Generals in the Rebellion's military, overseeing the Rebel victory at the Battle of Yavin. Thought dead in the chaos of the Evacuation of Yavin, he had in fact been captured by the Empire and was imprisoned in the notorious Lusankya facility. Liberated in 9 ABY, he resumed service with the New Republic until his death in 24 ABY.
            Throughout his long period of service, Dodonna showed a strong grasp of tactics and strategy, and along with Adar Tallon and Gial Ackbar, Dodonna was considered the authority on modern space combat.
            Jan Dodonna was born on Commenor. He began his military career in the Judicial Forces,[4] serving as a lieutenant in the crew of the cruiser Ardent IV during the Stark Hyperspace War.[1] Dodonna held the rank of captain by the time of the Clone Wars[7] and first rose to prominence during the conflict,[4] becoming one of the finest Star Destroyer captains in the Republic Navy.[5] Alongside his fellow captain Terrinald Screed, Dodonna commanded the two task forces that comprised the Victory Fleet.[7]
            After the Separatist Bulwark Fleet broke through the Republic's blockade of Foerost in 20.1 BBY, Dodonna and Screed clashed with Bulwark Fleet commander Dua Ningo at Ixtlar, Basilisk, and Alsakan. In the climactic Battle of Anaxes,[7] Dodonna cornered Admiral Ningo[4] and came under heavy fire in the atmosphere of Anaxes.[7] Dodonna fought furiously,[4] engaging Ningo's warships long enough to allow Screed to emerge from hyperspace and destroy Ningo's battlecruiser Unrepentant.[8] Dodonna and Screed both returned to Coruscant as heroes,[7] and Dodonna was awarded the Holt Cross on Anaxes three weeks after the battle he had fought there. As he traversed the Azure Walk, Dodonna physically supported his fellow honoree Screed, who had suffered nearly-mortal injuries in the battle at Anaxes.[8]
            Dodonna, along with Plo Koon, was later a member of the Republic negotiating team during the Battle of Rendili. Several months later he commanded the Republic fleet at the Battle of Cato Neimoidia.[9]
            Dodonna's grasp of strategy was particularly keen, and along with his old friend and fellow Republic officer Adar Tallon, Dodonna revolutionized the tactics of space combat. While Tallon's skill was in ship-to-ship warfare, Dodonna's expertise lay in logistics and siege tactics. He proposed a number of siege weapons, proposals later adopted by the Galactic Empire for their use in such operations as the Siege of Dalron Five and Project Asteroid.[10]
            Sometime during the war, he served alongside Nejaa Halcyon. He also convinced his old friend, Sagoro Autem, to quit his mercenary ways and join the Navy.[11]
            As the Republic became the Galactic Empire, Dodonna served loyally for a time, even advising Autem to keep quiet about his feelings on the alleged "Jedi Rebellion."[12] When the Sy Myrthian Insurrection began in 19 BBY, after the Separatist Senator Toonbuck Toora managed to reactivate a droid army in the Foundry of the Confederacy. Dodonna and his future fellow defector Admiral Adar Tallon were given command of the force to suppress it.[13]
            Deployed from Charros IV, Tallon and Dodonna led the 12th Sector Army in several months of attritional fighting on the world of Diado. After reducing Toora's forces there, they subsequently won another victory at Metalorn, before besieging Sy Myrth itself. Under Dodonna's expert guidance, the Empire eventually defeated the Separatists there. Tallon and Dodonna then chased down Toora's flagship, Defiance's Banner, with a task force led by the Praetor-class Star Battlecruiser Battalion. The end of the campaign came in the Trasemene system, after the Imperial task force cornered Toora's fleet there. In the ensuing battle, the Battalion ripped apart Toora's fleet with its turbolaser batteries, killing Toora and ending the insurrection.[13]
            Dodonna and Tallon's victories were celebrated in the Core Worlds, but Dodonna's loyalty to the Empire gradually became tested as it resorted to ever-more brutal acts of reprisal against purported sedition. Though he disliked what the Imperial regime was becoming, Dodonna's loyalty as a soldier led him to refuse to speak ill of it. Furthermore, he regarded the fledgling Rebel Alliance as a foolish provocation that would only cause chaos and misery.[14] Disillusioned and unhappy, Dodonna eventually retired from the service on ideological grounds. The Empire, in turn, gave the famous war hero Commenor's moon Brelor, where he spent many years raising his son Vrad.[15]
            Dodonna refused Mon Mothma's many offers for him to join her fledgling resistance movement, an act he considered treasonous.[15] However, COMPNOR officials deemed him a poor candidate for "retraining" for the Emperor's use, and around 1 BBY, deciding he was less potentially dangerous dead, ordered his assassination.[10][15][16]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jan_Dodonna/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJanDodonna</string></dict>
        <key>Vrad Dodonna</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.33.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vrad Dodonna was a Human male who was the son of General Jan Dodonna. He joined the Rebel Alliance alongside his father, becoming a starfighter pilot.
            He was killed not long after the Battle of Yavin when Darth Vader brought the Super Star Destroyer Executor to destroy the Rebels that had been blockaded by the Imperial Navy. Vrad's scout ship fled from the battle unharmed. Later, the Millennium Falcon came across the graveyard of ships, and while looking at the devastation, Luke Skywalker glimpsed Vrad's ship. When the Falcon arrived on Yavin IV, his ship soon followed. After getting in a fight with Skywalker, they went on a mission to sabotage the Executor. Utilizing an ancient power gem to pierce the ship's shields, he flew his craft in a suicide run straight at the ship, disabling it and buying more time for the Rebels to finish their evacuation. His death devastated his father.
            In The Official Star Wars Fact File 21 , Vrad was erroneously called General Dodonna's nephew.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vrad_Dodonna</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVradDodonna</string></dict>
        <key>Igear</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.34.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Igear was a young Human male native to the Undercity of Taris. He was the Outcast village's primary salvager and trader, and was very jealous of Gendar's position of leadership.
            Whether Igear was a trader before being found guilty of a crime and then sent down as an Outcast or a descendant of one is unclear as there is no information about his history. Igear was good at striking deals with the swoop gangs of the Lower City which made him the primary trader for the Outcast colony. Whenever an outcast found useful salvage they would bring it to Igear and he would trade it with the gangs for food, medicine or sometimes credits if he was lucky. However, he envied Gendar's position and did not agree with Gendar's views and ideals. At some point he attempted to hide supplies so that he would give them to the others when they would need them desperately, thereby gaining followerers. His goal in this matter was to this usurp Gendar. However, Gendar caught him and made him share his hoard. Though Gendar never trusted Igear again, he did not banish the shopkeeper because of his ability to make deals.[1]
            In 3956 BBY, Revan, an amnesiac former Sith Lord, came to the village while searching for Mission Vao as part of a larger quest to rescue Bastila Shan. It was likely Revan did buy a few things from Igear, as the Undercity was a dangerous place. When Rukil sent Revan to find out what happened to Malya, his former apprentice, Revan soon found her dead, and returned to Rukil with her journal. After revealing to Rukil his apprentice's fate, Rukil explained to Revan the Tarisian Civil War and the legend of the Promised Land. Revan agreed to Rukil's request to search for the missing journals from his father and grandfather, in order to complete the puzzle.[1]
            Igear overheard the conversation between Rukil and Revan. Unlike many from the Outcast village, Igear believed there might have been some truth to Rukil's stories. It was for this reason he wanted to stop Rukil from discovering its location. Igear felt that, for an Outcast, he lived life pretty well. His position as deal maker and shopkeeper meant the villagers relied on him. He believed his position of power was in turn dependent on the village needing his services. If the Outcasts discovered the Promised Land, his services would no longer be needed and he'd be "another nobody". He offered Revan a considerable sum of credits, something Rukil couldn't offer, to give the clues to the Land's location to him instead of Rukil, so that they might be destroyed. Revan found the missing journals, but refused Igear's offer and instead gave them to Rukil, who then managed to find out the location of the Promised Land. Igear, like all the other Outcasts, left the Undercity village for the Promised Land.[1]
            Igear was eager to get his hands on any food, medicine and credits, a trait common among most outcasts. Unlike the others however, Igear didn't believe that the salvagers who brought him salvage should get anything, because he believed that it was "his store, his profits". He also believed that if he was to survive he had to look out for number one. He was so self-centered he believed that if it wasn't for Gendar he would be in control of the village, something Carth Onasi commented that if it wasn't for Gendar the village would be a lot worse than it is. This self-centered behaviour made him unafraid to ruin the village's hope for salvation just because it compromised his position.
            Alternatively, Revan could have given the journals to Igear who then would have burnt them, leaving the Outcasts in the same situation with no hope. If the journals had been destroyed he would have rewarded Revan with 100 credits. He could have persuaded for more -— 200 credits (if his skill in persuasion had been high enough).
            In the Strategy Guide, Igear intends to sell them to the Black Vulkars.
            Igear is portrayed with a different face in the Xbox version of the game, he is portrayed as light skinned instead of dark.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Igear</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascIgear</string></dict>
        <key>Dhowar Repareed</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.35.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dhowar Repareed was a human male who worked as an air traffic controller in his home village on the planet Savareen. His tongue was cut out by the Crimson Dawn syndicate when he and the other villages stood up to them; however, he was still able to maintain an effective silent communications network. In 10 BBY, he was present when the Cloud-Riders and a group of criminals formerly affiliated with Crimson Dawn joined together with the villagers to oppose the syndicate.
            Dhowar Repareed was a human male who lived in a village constructed in the ruins of the Bis Refinery on the Pnakotic Coast of his homeworld Savareen.[1] Like the other inhabitants of the village, he had had his tongue cut out by the Crimson Dawn syndicate after the villagers stood up to the criminals and refused to pay tribute.[2] He worked as an air traffic controller, which is the easiest job of the village, so he has enough time for dreaming.[1]
            When a broken starship comming to his village, he passed threw frightened minutes.[1] In 10 BBY,[3] he was present in the village when a group of Crimson Dawn affiliates led by the criminal Tobias Beckett landed in order to process coaxium they had stolen from the planet Kessel. He then witnessed the stand-off between the criminals and the Cloud-Riders gang and aided the two groups when they worked together to defeat the forces of the Crimson Dawn when they arrived on Savareen to collect the coaxium.[2]
            Dhowar Repareed first appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story[2] and was first named in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dhowar_Repareed</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDhowarRepareed</string></dict>
        <key>Irek Ismaren</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.36.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Irek Ismaren was a Human male from the planet Alderaan, the son of Sarcev Quest and Roganda Ismaren, one of Emperor Palpatine's concubines. Due to his mother's position, Irek was rumored to be the Emperor's son, and Roganda cultivated these rumors, raising her son as a possible heir to the throne. Irek was Force-sensitive, and he began to train in the dark side of the Force from an early age under the tutelage of his mother and the Imperial scientist, Nasdra Magrody. When Irek was five, Magrody installed a subelectronic converter into his brain, allowing him to control droids and computers through the Force. Midway through Irek's training, Palpatine was killed in 4 ABY at the Battle of Endor, but the eight-year-old Irek was not ready to stake a claim to the Empire. His mother retreated with Irek to her childhood home on Belsavis, continuing Irek's training to prepare for a future bid for the throne. In 12 ABY, Irek's mother had formulated a plot to reunite the fractured Empire and place Irek as the new Emperor. Irek used his abilities to summon the Eye of Palpatine, a massive dreadnaught abandoned in the Moonflower Nebula. The ship was to be a bargaining chip for financial backers from Senex-Juvex, who would use the Eye of Palpatine as the centerpiece of an allied fleet that would help them rebuild the Empire. However, when the dreadnaught arrived above Belsavis, Irek found that he could no longer control it. Irek and his mother abandoned Belsavis, and the ship was destroyed by saboteurs from the New Jedi Order.
            Irek and his mother made their way to Coruscant where they took up residence in a hidden laboratory. While there, Irek was subjected to growth hormones and cybernetic enhancements, greatly increasing his strength and causing him to grow to three meters in height. Additionally, lightsabers were installed in his elbows, forearms, wrists, and knees. During this transformation, Irek's mother recruited Lord Cronal to continue his training. However, during one of his lessons, Irek instigated a lightsaber duel with Cronal. He was able to defeat his teacher, but sustained a lightsaber thrust through the skull. Brain-dead, Irek was placed into suspended animation by his mother as she attempted to repair him. The damaged parts of Irek's mind were replaced by computer parts, but his personality and identity was gone. Desperate for her son to return, Roganda planned to install operational programming and memories into Irek to bring him back. Before this could occur, a groundquake caused by the Yuuzhan Vong's conquest of Coruscant freed Irek from stasis. With no knowledge of who he was or what had happened to him, he murdered his mother and escaped from the laboratory, seeking out a wellspring of Force energy nearby. The wellspring was protected by the ruins of the old Jedi Temple, and Irek commanded legions of displaced refugees to help him break past the barrier. His minions, frightened of Irek's monstrous form and incredible powers, dubbed him Lord Nyax, from the Corellian legend about a dark spirit. With no knowledge of his own past, Irek took up the moniker for himself. Irek eventually broke into the Force nexus, granting him greater control over the Force than ever before. However, he was confronted by a taskforce led by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. One of the Jedi in the taskforce, Tahiri Veila, used Yuuzhan Vong technology, unable to be sensed in the Force, to ambush "Lord Nyax". Badly injured by thud bugs, Irek fell, using the last of his energy to propel a torrent of rubble and debris at his attackers. The effort imprinted Irek's anger and frustration in the area where he had collapsed. Skywalker and the other Jedi sensed Nyax's death through the Force, but later reports claimed that he escaped.
            Irek was born on the planet Alderaan,[3] in 4 BBY.[2] He was the son of Roganda Ismaren[10] and Sarcev Quest,[11] who were both Emperor's Hands, elite dark side users that reported directly to Galactic Emperor Palpatine.[12] From his birth, Irek was rumored to be the son of the Emperor, due to his mother's role as one of Palpatine's concubines. His mother cultivated these rumors, hoping to set her son up as the heir to the Imperial throne.[6] While still a child, Irek began to train in the dark side of the Force under his mother, who hoped to develop him into a talented Force user.[5] To aid her son's progress, Roganda kidnapped the Imperial scientist Nasdra Magrody to help train Irek. Magrody was chosen due to his research into the possibility of implanting a device into a Force-sensitive's brain to allow that person to manipulate technology through the Force.[9] When Irek turned five, the captive Magrody implanted his invention, a subelectronic converter into Irek's brain, allowing the young boy to use the Force to affect machinery.[5] Two years later, at the age of seven, Irek began further training in the dark side of the Force, overseen by Magrody,[1] who had a modicum of Force-sensitivity.[5] Magrody also schooled Irek in scientific lessons, using accelerated learning techniques that he had developed at Omwat orbital station. Through the use of his subelectronic converter, Irek was taught to control machines through the Force by visualizing their schematics. To accomplish this, Irek studied a wide variety of technology and memorized common droid graphics.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Irek_Ismaren</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascIrekIsmaren</string></dict>
        <key>Kavar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.37.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kavar was a Jedi Master and member of the Jedi High Council during the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War. He was also close friends with Meetra Surik, who learned under him as an informal Padawan prior to the Mandalorian Wars.
            Little is known about Kavar's early life. It is possible that he fought in the Great Sith War. It is also known that, at some point, he informally trained Meetra Surik who would eventually become known as the Jedi Exile. He would become good friends with her at some point. At the beginning of the Mandalorian Wars, Kavar was involved in skirmishes against the Mandalorians. The Mandalorians came to believe that Kavar, the "famed Jedi Guardian", would be placed in command of the Republic's overall war effort once the Jedi entered the war.[1]
            However, the Council chose to remain neutral throughout the conflict, and it was Jedi Knights Revan and Malak who led a force of rebellious Jedi in their place. Many among the Mandalorian survivors often wondered how differently the war would have gone had Master Kavar, not Revan, been leading the Jedi during those fateful years.[3] After the war with the Mandalorians was over, the High Council judged Surik for joining Revan in his crusade against the Mandalorians. The Council chose to banish her, but not because she followed Revan. They sensed that she was a wound in the Force, and were afraid of what might happen if she remained in the Order.
            Little information is known about Kavar during the Jedi Civil War except that he fought alongside the Jedi ranks against the forces of Darth Malak. He was presumed dead at some point during these events, but that was far from the truth.[1]
            After the Jedi Civil War, Kavar went to Onderon and became the advisor of Queen Talia. He would stay in the shadows of the Royal Palace, but when he did speak, he was described as being "cryptic as hell." As tensions rose between Queen Talia and her cousin, General Vaklu, Kavar urged Talia to wait until the true threat, Vaklu's unseen supporters, showed itself.[1]
            When the Ebon Hawk attempted to land in Iziz, Vaklu's forces under Colonel Tobin's command fired upon it, sparking a dogfight between Onderonian forces and the Republic and creating more tension in the city. Through the alliance of the Mandalorians on Dxun, the captain of the Ebon Hawk, Meetra Surik, made arrangements through a doctor named Dhagon Ghent to meet Kavar.[1] Kavar met with Surik in the Iziz Cantina. Just as Surik was to learn the full circumstances behind her trial, Tobin's forces showed up and opened fire in the cantina. Kavar stunned Tobin's men and escaped to the palace, while Surik was forced to fight her way through several troops back to her ship. As he ran, Kavar told Surik that he would get word to her when he was able.[1]
            Not too long after these events, Kavar sent a message to the Mandalorian Kelborn, telling him to contact Surik and tell her that he had arranged safe passage for her back to Onderon. But Surik got the message too late: the Council of Lords, under the influence of General Vaklu, decreed that Talia was guilty of treason soon after the message was sent.[1] With the Onderonian military divided between support for Talia and Vaklu, the Onderon Civil War began and passage to the planet was no longer safe. When Surik heard the message, she rushed back to Dxun and enlisted the aid of the Mandalorians there. She then used a Basilisk war droid to reach Onderon.[1]
            While Surik made her way to the palace, Kavar and a group of troops fought at the palace gates against Vaklu's supporters, the Sith and their beasts. Kavar was forced to retreat inside the palace, where he coordinated the battle. The Exile eventually reached Kavar, and he directed her to Captain Kadron.[1] When Surik made it to the throne room, Kavar rushed in and eliminated some of Vaklu's troops. He stayed back, however, when Talia and Surik fought Vaklu themselves. He would also remain quiet when Talia decreed that Vaklu was to be executed. The short but devastating civil war was ended, with Onderon's rightful ruler still on the throne.[1]
            Kavar answered Surik's questions, but was shocked to learn that Atris survived the attack on Katarr, not knowing that she had never attended the conclave. He agreed to join the Council on Dantooine after the Exile had gathered all of the remaining Jedi Masters.[1]
            Once Surik had done so, he met with fellow Masters Vrook Lamar and Zez-Kai Ell at the rebuilt Jedi Enclave, and encountered Surik for what would be the last time. The Council decided that it was time Surik knew the truth, and told her everything: she was a wound in the Force, she had cut herself off from the Force. All three of them found it necessary to rid Surik of the Force, fearing she was a threat to life itself. However, as they were about to cut Surik's ties to the Force, Kreia, whom Kavar and the other masters had previously believed to be dead, entered.[1]
            After presenting herself, Kreia decided to make the three Jedi "see the Force through the eyes of the Exile" and killed them with an extreme version of Force drain leaving them dead and drained of the Force.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kavar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKavar</string></dict>
        <key>Zayne Carrick</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.38.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zayne Carrick was a male Human who was a Jedi Padawan during the Mandalorian Wars. Born to a banker and a gardener, Carrick was barely accepted into the Jedi Order, with his level of Force sensitivity described as "marginal," and spent his Youngling days at the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. He was later assigned as the Padawan to Jedi Master Lucien Draay. Unbeknownst to both Carrick and the Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council, Draay was a member of Jedi Covenant, a secret organization bent on preventing the return of the Sith by any means necessary.
            Training on the ecumenopolis of Taris under the supervision of Draay and four other Jedi Masters, Carrick never expected to go far; he lacked confidence in his abilities, performed poorly for a future Jedi, and was treated as little more than a source of comic relief by everyone who knew him. He repeatedly failed to capture Marn Hierogryph, a small-time hood and con-Snivvian. Not even expecting to be Knighted, he nevertheless attended the Knighting ceremony. Running characteristically late after finally capturing Hierogryph, he found his four fellow Padawans dead—killed by their own Masters in cold blood.
            As Carrick later discovered, the Masters saw a vision that identified someone wearing a red environment suit (similar to the suits which the Padawans were wearing at the time of the prophecy) as a threat to the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic. As the only surviving Padawan, he was accused by the Covenant of the murders and became the subject of an interstellar manhunt. He united with Marn Hierogryph and two mysterious Arkanian Offshoots, Camper and Jarael, in his quest to avenge his murdered friends and force the Masters to confess their crime and clear his name. Little did he know that, on his run, he would be thrown right in the middle of the emerging Mandalorian Wars, chased by the Republic and the Mandalorians alike.
            However, after meeting an agent for the Covenant, Celeste Morne, Carrick decided to take a pro-active stance against the Covenant and took the fight straight to Coruscant after gathering evidence to present to the Jedi High Council. Carrick cleared his name of the Padawans' death after First WatchCircle member Xamar confessed and the actions of Haazen, a retainer to Covenant leader Krynda Draay, created an insurrection within the Order. Haazen was stopped by the combined efforts of both Carrick and Lucien Draay, though the latter was believed to have perished with Haazen. In the wake of the events, the High Council offered Carrick the title of Jedi Knight, though he turned down the offer to begin his partnership with Gryph as a loner Jedi—looking out for the people who fell beneath the Jedi Order's notice.
            Carrick would participate with Gryph in various schemes to swindle deserving targets out of their credits. However, during these missions, they found out that the businesses they were targeting were hiding a darker side: from dubious trading practices to an entire slavery operation. Equally troubling for Carrick was his encounter with Sith adept Toki Tollivar aboard the Chancellor Fillorean, the mysterious behavior of Demagol (disguised as Rohlan Dyre), and the dark secrets that Jarael, who had turned out to be Force-sensitive, was keeping. After rescuing famed racer Goethar Kleej and his son Aubin, Jarael admitted to Carrick that she had been a reluctant member of a slaving organization named the Crucible before she was able to escape. Carrick agreed to help her take down the slavers since she had done so much for him during his fugitive days.
            After the complicity of the First WatchCircle in the Padawan Massacre was revealed, Carrick, Shel Jelavan and the family members of the dead Padawans established the Rogue Moon Project, an organization that was dedicated to helping the refugees from the Mandalorian Wars and falsely accused fugitives on the run. Funded with money that Carrick and his crew earned on their cons, the organization immediately set to work tracking down leads that led to Crucible operations that the Hot Prospect crew could shut down. Although they were successful in stopping Crucible operations in the Koornacht Cluster and Volgax, the relationship between Carrick and Jarael soured due to the manipulation of Carrick by Jarael's former rival, Chantique, the Magister Impressor of the slaving organization during the mission on Volgax.
            The broken relationship led to the departure of Jarael and the disguised Demagol from the Hot Prospect, while the remaining crew traveled back to Coruscant to attend the trial of Rohlan Dyre, who was thought to be Demagol. Before the trial, a statement by the droid Elbee led the realization of the true identities of both Mandalorians. Carrick and Hierogryph were able to smuggle Dyre out of the trial. The trio decided to mount a desperate rescue mission of Jarael, little knowing that Demagol had already revealed himself to the Arkanian Offshoot as her former teacher Antos Wyrick. As Carrick used blackmail and deception to ascertain the whereabouts of the two, Jarael and Demagol were already on Osadia to free prisoners and get their revenge on the Crucible.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zayne_Carrick</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZayneCarrick</string></dict>
        <key>CC-5052</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.39.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>CC-5052, nicknamed "Bly," was a Clone Commander and Advanced Recon Commando who served in the Grand Army of the Republic's 327th Star Corps during the Clone Wars. A genetic clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, Bly was grown on the planet Kamino. During the course of the War, he served under Jedi General Aayla Secura, a female Twi'lek Jedi Master who was once apprenticed to the infamous Jedi Quinlan Vos. Bly developed a close working relationship with Secura and accompanied the Jedi Master on a variety of missions to different planets throughout the war.
            Whilst in the skies above the planet Quell, Bly and Secura were attacked by a fleet of ships belonging to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During a chaotic rescue by the Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the frigate that the group were attempting escape onboard suddenly entered hyperspace, where they narrowly avoided crashing into a star. As a result, the frigate crash landed on the nearby planet Maridun, where the group sought out help for Skywalker who had been wounded during their escape. After discovering a Lurmen village and discussing their situation with the village elder, Skywalker was brought to the village to be nursed back to good health.
            Later, as Bly and the others rested at the village, Separatist battle droids arrived and the group discovered a Confederate outpost where an important weapons test would determine whether or not a new Separatist Defoliator Deployment Tank was fit for use. The group then waited for the cover of nightfall before infiltrating the outpost and stealing valuable equipment which, when they returned to the village, they used to shield the Lurmen people from the Defoliator's devastating cannon. Bly and the others fought the battle droids in an attempt to protect the villagers and after the Lurmen aided them, the battle was won.
            During the final days of the Clone Wars, Bly and the 327th Star Corps under the command of Aayla Secura travelled to the Outer Rim planet Felucia where they tracked down the Separatist Council member Shu Mai. However, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine of the Galactic Republic issued Order 66 before the Battle of Felucia could begin. Bly and the clones then killed Secura in what would later be known as the Jedi Purge.
            CC-5052, later known as "Bly," was a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett created on Kamino.[2] At some point prior to his service during the Clone Wars, he was trained by ARC troopers to be one of the first Clone Commanders[3] and becoming an ARC trooper himself.[4]
            During the Clone Wars, Bly and Jedi General Aayla Secura came under attack over the planet Quell by a Separatist fleet. Anakin Skywalker, his apprentice Ahsoka Tano, and Clone Captain Rex organised a rescue of Secura and her troops. Storming Secura's star destroyer, Skywalker, Tano and Rex were able to locate and successfully rescue Secura, Bly and a few surviving clones. However, Skywalker was seriously injured during the mission and Bly assisted in piloting a frigate to the Resolute in order to get the Jedi appropriate medical attention. While attempting to dock, the frigate's hyperdrive was activated, forcing them to detach from the Resolute. The cruiser then quickly entered hyperspace just moments after detaching. Later as the frigate travelled through hyperspace, Bly was able to notice that the coordinates were set to take them directly into a star. After a successful attempt at avoiding the star, the frigate crash landed on the world of Maridun, and the group were forced to search for help to aid an injured Skywalker.[5]
            Along the way, Bly discovered a signpost indicating that there were sentient lifeforms nearby. Leaving Skywalker and Rex behind, the remainder of the group journeyed across the grasslands to look for someone who might be able to assist the wounded Jedi. However, during their travels, they were viciously attacked by Mastiff phalones, and the three other clones accompanying them were killed by the creatures. Shortly afterwards they were able to find a Lurmen village, populated by many Lurmen villagers. At first the village elder, Tee Watt Kaa, refused to help but when he learned of their friend's plight, he allowed his son Wag Too to accompany them back to Skywalker. Bly, Tano and Wag Too headed back to the injured Jedi. Once there, the trio ,along with Rex, managed to subdue another Mastiff Phalone that was attempting to kill the Jedi and the Clone Captain. Bly and Rex then carried Skywalker back to the Lurmen village where he rested and was nursed by the Lurmen people.[5]
            Later, Bly was resting in the Lurmen village when he witnessed a couple of Lurmen struggling to pile baskets of food. He helped them with their troubles and they thanked him by giving him a Jogan fruit, which he gladly ate. Bly was then informed that a Separatist C-9979 landing craft was setting down near to the village. Along with the rest of the group, he helped Skywalker escape as the battle droids searched the village for contraband. As they watched and hid in the tall grass, a probe droid discovered them, but before it could transfer any information, Bly jammed it's signal. He, Tano and Rex pursued whilst Secura calmly assessed the situation. Deciding it best not the chase the droid, she separated from the others and was able to cut the droid off from the front.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/CC-5052</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCC5052</string></dict>

        <key>Freja Covell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.41.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Freja Covell was a male Human from Corulag who served as a general in the Imperial Army. One of Grand Admiral Thrawn's chief army commanders during his offensive against the New Republic, Covell led the takeover of the abandoned headquarters of Talon Karrde's organization on Myrkr. He was later killed by the insane clone Joruus C'baoth not long before Thrawn himself died at the hands of the Noghri, Rukh.
            Covell had freshly graduated from the Academy when he was made a junior officer in an Army regiment commanded by Colonel Maximilian Veers. Under the colonel's tutelage, Covell learned to command ground forces and grew to love the AT-AT divisions as much as Veers did. They both understood the power of walkers and the fear they generated in the enemy. To sit in the cockpit of a walker satisfied Covell like nothing else could. Veers saw himself reflected in the younger officer, so that when Veers was promoted to general and given command of Darth Vader's ground forces in 3 ABY, he brought Covell with him, where Covell's excellent performance earned him the rank of colonel in charge of one of Veers' battlegroups.
            Lieutenant Colonel Freja Covell managed to get the backing of the Assassin's Guild to fight three Rebel SpecForces units on Archais. The battle of Archais put both the Shroud and Eclipse Teams on the ropes. At that same moment, Rebel officer Mosara Thiirn deserted, surrendering her ship and herself to Covell, which led to an increasingly bad situation for the Rebel forces. Unfortunately for the Empire, Thiirn did not know any information they were unaware of.[1]
            In the Battle of Hoth, in which Veers' assault force routed the Rebel troops defending Echo Base, High Colonel Covell served as Veers' "first officer," and personally commanded one of the AT-ATs assigned to Blizzard Force. The Rebel tactics brought down his walker, wounding him in the process, but he made a good showing of himself and his command abilities. Despite his wounds, he got to safety and took charge of a stormtrooper group, which routed a larger number of Rebel troops before they could dig into defensive positions.[2]
            Later, Captain Gilad Pellaeon promoted Covell to the rank of Major General and placed him in command of the ground forces aboard the Chimaera. Subsequently, Grand Admiral Thrawn advanced Covell, now a general to a position of senior leadership in the Army.[2] During Thrawn's campaign, General Covell commanded numerous ground assaults—often leading from the front—and was finally assigned to the protection of Wayland. At Wayland, Joruus C'baoth took control of his mind with the Force, and in fact replaced parts of Covell's mind with his own. However, a group of ysalamiri created interference with the Force that severed the connection. Covell's mind was compromised severely—while he lived for a short time inside the ysalamiri's bubble, long enough to relay some "special orders" given to him by C'baoth, he was dead before the next morning.[3]
            Covell was a brilliant ground tactician. Like Veers, Covell mastered the commanding of the AT-AT and AT-ST units in battle during the post-Endor campaigns, ensuring that they would continued to be used by Imperial ground forces for years to come. Many of Covell's innovative ground battle tactics were adopted by later Imperial Army commanders.
            Covell disliked Imperial Navy officers, thinking them to be afraid to leave their ships and enter real combat.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Freja_Covell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFrejaCovell</string></dict>
        <key>Jaden Korr</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.42.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jaden Korr was a Human male Force-sensitive who was accepted to train as a Jedi at Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on the moon of Yavin 4 in 14 ABY. Assigned as an apprentice to Jedi Master Kyle Katarn, Korr participated in the fight against a newly emerged dark side cult called the Disciples of Ragnos, which sought to resurrect an ancient Sith Lord, Marka Ragnos. Korr undertook multiple missions throughout the galaxy, foiling the cult's plans as best as he could and earning himself a promotion to the rank of Jedi Knight. Eventually, Korr defeated the leader of the cult, Tavion Axmis, on the Sith world of Korriban, stopping the Disciples of Ragnos.
            In 40 ABY, during the Second Galactic Civil War, Korr participated in the Battle of Centerpoint Station, during which he killed over two dozen people aboard the Corellian superweapon by spacing them, an act he later came to regret deeply. Having struggled throughout his whole life with the feeling of doubt and afraid of his natural affinity for dark side powers, Korr became disillusioned with the Jedi Order and his own role with the Force. He distanced himself from the Jedi and lived in a self-imposed exile on Coruscant until he received a vision from the Force that directed him to a frozen moon in the Unknown Regions. Korr then enlisted the crew of the salvage ship Junker, the Human Khedryn Faal and the Cerean Marr Idi-Shael, to fly him to the moon from his vision. Arriving there, Korr and his companions received a distress signal coming from the surface of the moon and also encountered the ancient Sith dreadnaught Harbinger, as well as Jedi Master Relin Druur. Both Druur and the crew of the Sith vessel had unknowingly traveled five thousand years through time from the Great Hyperspace War.
            While Druur went on his separate path and destroyed the Harbinger carrying the cargo of powerful Lignan crystals, Korr followed his vision and landed on the frozen moon, where he found an abandoned Imperial research facility, in which the Empire's scientists had been conducting experiments on creating clones from combined Jedi and Sith DNA. However, the clones had gone mad and had killed their creators. As the surviving clones escaped from the moon, Korr and the crew of Junker pursued them, with Korr taking on the Force-sensitive Idi-Shael as his apprentice. His experiences on the frozen moon also taught Korr to accept the feeling of doubt as an integral part of himself. Following the clones' trail, Korr also discovered that one of the clones, Soldier, had been produced from his DNA.
            Eventually, Korr and the two scavengers tracked the clones to an ancient Rakatan space station, which had developed its own consciousness and which the clones venerated as "Mother." Aboard the station, Korr and Idi-Shael were ambushed by the Umbaran Nyss Nenn, an agent of the One Sith organization. Korr killed the Umbaran but was in turn killed by the Iteration, another clone of his created by the One Sith and intended to replace Korr in the Jedi Order as their agent. Thanks to Idi-Shael's quick thinking, however, Korr's consciousness was preserved in the Iteration's body; Korr's apprentice used the mindspear device to transfer Korr's memories into the clone, after which Korr and his Padawan escaped from Mother. Korr remained unaware of the transfer that had occurred, and he returned to the Jedi Order, continuing his respectable career.
            Jaden Korr was a Human male[3] raised on[1] the galactic capital[8] planet of Coruscant by adoptive parents during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. When Korr was just a young boy, his adoptive parents died in a shuttle accident, and his uncle Orn took the boy in and took care of him.[1]
            Korr remembered very little of his adoptive parents, mostly vague details like the smell of his mother's hair, and he knew them mostly through family holographic pictures and video recordings. While living with his uncle, Korr jokingly referred to his caretaker as "Uncle Orn the Hutt," due to the man's obesity and wheezing laugh.[1]
            As an adolescent, Korr, while using one of his uncle's tools, accidentally acquired a scar on his right cheek, which never properly healed and remained there from that point on. The death of Korr's parents caused him to retreat deep within himself and to become overly philosophical for his age. Over the years, that self-seclusion led to Korr's discovery of his latent Force-sensitivity.[1]
            In the year 9 ABY,[9] Korr was inadvertently involved in Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn's experiments with cloning. Thrawn hoped to produce Force-sensitive individuals inside a research facility on a frozen moon[3] in the UR-2212-GR system[4] in the Unknown Regions.[3]
            Supplying the project with[3] the recently discovered[10] Spaarti cloning cylinders as well as DNA samples of various Jedi and Sith, Thrawn tasked the scientists working at the facility with producing clones from the combined DNA to create powerful Force-users to serve the Empire[3] who could wield both sides of the Force effectively.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jaden_Korr</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJadenKorr</string></dict>
        <key>Vrook Lamar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.43.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vrook Lamar was a Human male who served as a Jedi Master as early as the time of the Great Hunt, holding a seat on the Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council. He was also a member of the Jedi High Council throughout the Mandalorian Wars, the Jedi Civil War, and the Dark Wars. He was friends with fellow Council member Vandar Tokare, despite rarely concurring with him on anything, most notably the decision of accepting Revan back into the Jedi Order after his fall to the dark side of the Force. He retreated to Dantooine after the Conclave at Katarr as what remained of the Jedi waited for the Sith to reveal themselves, but he was killed by Kreia in the ruins of the Jedi Enclave when Meetra Surik had a council assembled to take action against the Sith Triumvirate.
            In the years following the Great Sith War, Lamar was stationed at the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, though he occasionally attended Council meetings at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Exar Kun had dealt the Jedi a great blow to their numbers, so when the terentatek were discovered to be behind the deaths of more Jedi throughout the galaxy, the High Council started a Great Hunt to wipe them out. The hunt officially ended in 3993 BBY, when the last of the species were driven deep under Korriban, and it was deemed too dangerous to seek them out due to the planet's strong ties to the Sith. Three Jedi Knights, Shaela Nuur, Duron Qel-Droma, and Guun Han Saresh were chosen to continue the hunt, and reported to the Council on Dantooine. Lamar, as well as other members of the Council, had strong reservations about sending such a meager party of Jedi, as well as sending a Qel-Droma to Korriban, given what Duron's cousin, Ulic, had done in the recent war. The other Masters, though they agreed on the first point, argued that it was unfair to judge a Jedi by their blood.[3]
            Sometime before the Mandalorian Wars, when Meetra Surik was still a student at the Jedi academy on Dantooine, Lamar caught her in a heated argument with his Padawan and asked Master Vandar for proper disciplinary action, since her master would take no steps against her. Lamar called her a "mediocre Jedi" with a lust for power that would lead her to the dark side, and also voiced his concern on her strong influence on the other Padawans, as whatever they saw her do some were quick to do the same while others intensely opposed her. Vandar, however, believed Surik's was a unique strength and that she was just a natural leader, so he told Lamar that her discipline was none of his concern.[1]
            Something else on which Lamar and Tokare had the chance to disagree on, was the choice of apprentice five Padawan learners to Jedi Masters Feln, Q'Anilia, Raana Tey, Xamar, and Lucien Draay, a cloistered group that was secretly part of the Jedi Covenant, a cabal which Sage Master Krynda Draay had founded years before with the purpose of guarding against a new Sith outbreak. The students were trained at the Jedi academy on Taris, a rimworld with little law and order whence the Jedi were making an effort to conjure up new Jedi Knights to help maintain peace and justice.
            However, just before the Mandalorians would invade the Galactic Republic, the students were killed by their own teachers. Framed for the murders, Zayne Carrick, the only Padawan to escape the massacre, turned himself in after learning that a prophecy was catalyst for his Masters' actions that could mean he was going to collapse the Republic and the Jedi Order. As he was brought in chains to the Jedi Tower, Lamar saw him on the holonews in the council chamber of the Enclave, before Carrick resolved to escape once more to protect people who helped him that his Master would not spare.[4]
            With ever more Jedi following Revan to war, Lamar was frustrated with the diminished authority of the Council, and would chide further defiance. Although the five Masters of Taris had not actually confessed to the murders, they were all reassigned to different postings per Lamar's demand, as he felt that they had failed in the most basic mission a Master can have, which was protecting their student. As they stood judgment before the High Council on Coruscant, Tokare regretted he did not listen to Lamar when he showed reluctance in assigning learners to uneager teachers.[5]
            Raana Tey's outburst at Lamar's decision of dividing her group was met with equal passion by Lamar. When the Jedi withdrew from Taris, the planet had only recently joined the Republic; its citizens were left by both of them to fend for themselves against the impending Mandalorian invasion. After the Battle of Jebble, the High Council offered Lucien Draay to join them, but Lamar didn't like the way he had fed off opposition to Revanchism and how the Draay Trust had gained him consensus among the councilors, not to mention the fact that little before they were reprimanding his group for failing to protect their students. Draay accepted the seat, and while Lamar and Tokare agreed to this, it was but a means of keeping a closer look on him and learning more about the Padawan Massacre and the one Tokare sensed behind his rise to power. This person was Haazen, Krynda Draay's aide, and his reason was for the Covenant Shadows to be employed with more freedom.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vrook_Lamar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVrookLamar</string></dict>

He worked as a sentry for the gang's den in Coronet City, and in 13 BBY, he was present when the scrumrat Han escaped from the gang's leader, Lady Proxima.
            LeKelf was human male from the planet Corellia who served as a scrumrat in the White Worms gang of Coronet City. By the time that he was one of the older scrumrats in the gang, LeKelf's loyalty had earned him a number of perks, including sentry duty near the surface of Den of the White Worms, which allowed him access to slightly fresher air than most other gang members.[1]
            In the year 13 BBY,[3] LeKelf was present in the den when fellow scrumrat Han was brought before Lady Proxima, leader of the gang. Han, who had returned from a trade with no goods for Proxima, used a rock to break a shutter behind the gang leader and bathe her in light, which burned her skin. Using the distraction, Han then pushed through the other scrumrats and escaped.[2]
            LeKelf was a loyal member of the White Worms[1] with tan skin and brown eyes.[2]

        <key>Mical</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.45.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mical, or "the Disciple", was a Human male Jedi Master who had served as a diplomat for the Galactic Republic in the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War. A knowledgeable historian, he was one of several tasked with attempting to contact any remaining Jedi and convince them to return to the Republic. The Jedi Exile, Meetra Surik encountered him during her journey to gather the Lost Jedi, and he joined the crew of the Ebon Hawk, possibly due to the admiration he had for her since his youth. He became her informal Padawan, resuming the training he had begun in childhood, and becoming a Jedi Consular. After his travels with Surik, he devoted himself to rebuilding the Jedi Order and would eventually sit on the re-established Jedi High Council as a Master. He also became one of the Order's greatest historians.
            Mical was a Force-sensitive child, possibly from a Mid Rim colony. He was brought to the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine to be trained in the ways of the Jedi. He became somewhat enamored of Meetra Surik after she taught his class of younglings to hear the Force sing within others. Comparing her with Master Vrook Lamar, Mical felt that while he was knowledgeable, he was not a natural leader or a mentor as was Surik.[2]
            By the time Mical came of age, the Mandalorian Wars were raging. Many Jedi had gone to war against the wishes of the Jedi Council, including Revan, Malak, and the Jedi that Mical had hoped would take him as a Padawan, Surik. Soon few masters remained and by the time that Mical was ready to begin apprenticeship there was no one left who was fit to train him. He was one of many who were denied the path of the Jedi at this time, in part due to the doubts he was having following the exile of his mentor, so he decided to serve the Republic instead.[2]
            In the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War, Mical was one of the few who maintained the distinction between the Jedi and the Sith. With the Jedi gone, he sought to preserve their history by studying their teachings and gathering artifacts. He had heard mention that one of the Jedi had gone to Dantooine, so he went to the ruins of the Jedi Enclave, but found no trace of them. He found Meetra Surik instead, who told him of her search for the remaining Jedi Masters, and welcomed his company when Mical offered to apply his knowledge and skills to her quest, which seemed compatible with his.[2]
            Although history was Mical's specialty, he had some medical training as well, and served as a surrogate medic aboard the Ebon Hawk. He also taught Surik a meditation technique to replenish her personal Force reservoir.[2]
            At first Mical was not open about his past involvement with the Jedi, nor did he give out his true name, instead going by "Disciple." After Surik had gained his trust, he confessed to having met her as a young student at the Jedi Enclave, and told of how his connection to the Force had faded since then. Surik offered to train him in the ways of the Force, and he gladly accepted the offer, becoming her Padawan at last and taking on the class of Jedi Consular.[2]
            As they traveled together, Mical was unable to hide his feelings for Surik. Though such things were forbidden to Jedi, Mical believed that the Jedi teachings were fundamentally flawed. He believed that the Jedi were too removed from everyday life, and from the very things that made them living, feeling beings. Still, though he never denied his forbidden love for Surik, it amounted to little more than flattery and innocent flirtation in the end. This placed him at odds with Atton Rand, who also desired Surik's feelings.[2]
            While aboard the Ebon Hawk, Mical maintained clandestine communication with his Republic commanders, telling his true mission to no one—even Surik herself. When the party learned that Darth Nihilus was on his way to Telos IV, Mical sent a message to his Republic superiors warning them of the imminent threat.[2]
            Throughout the journey, Mical pored over information about Revan and the Sith, discerning a pattern and strategy to Revan's attacks during the Jedi Civil War, and coming to the frightening conclusion that Revan's surgical strikes against the Republic were not meant to crush it into submission. Revan's tactics instead seemed more in line with conquering the galaxy to unite it under a single banner, possibly against an unseen threat. Kreia walked in on him just as he had made this analysis and ambushed him, forcing him to forget his discoveries until she felt the time was right for him to remember.[2]
            After Surik met with the Council members, she separated herself from her companions. When she told Mical that the Council had informed her she was unknowingly forcing her companions to follow her, Mical comforted her. He told her that the council made that judgment in arrogance because they denied what made them actual feeling beings. He also reassured her that he and all her other companions were following her because they chose to. He followed Surik to the end of their battle against the Sith. He was later left behind when Surik started her journey to find Revan.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mical</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMical</string></dict>

        <key>Mij Gilamar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.47.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mij Gilamar was a Human male doctor and Mandalorian warrior who served the Cuy'val Dar during the Clone Wars.
            Mij Gilamar was a male Human doctor who, at some time before 32 BBY, met and fell in love with a Mandalorian girl named Tani. The two were wed, and Gilamar joined the Mandalorian culture. At some point afterward, his wife was tragically murdered and Gilamar vowed to kill the man who did it, painting his armor the traditional sand-gold that marked a mission of vengeance in the Mandalorian community.
            Gilamar was one of seventy-five Mandalorian warriors selected by bounty hunter Jango Fett to help train elite clone commandos on the planet Kamino, as part of the hundred-member force known as the Cuy'val Dar—"Those Who No Longer Exist". Gilamar greatly despised his fellow training sergeants Dred Priest and Isabet Reau, believing them to be as bad as the Death Watch in their radical views on Mandalorian superiority, and hated Priest for operating a secret fight club in which many clones were injured. During his time on Kamino, he befriended ARC trooper Alpha-Ø2, also known as Spar, when the clone would fake severe headaches, backaches, and to be hearing voices in order to spend time in the medical bay where Gilamar worked. Gilamar later facilitated Spar's defection from the Grand Army of the Republic and aided in his escape from Kamino, calling in a favor with Fett to smuggle him out in the cargo hold of the Slave I.
            During the Clone Wars, he worked alongside fellow former Cuy'val Dar Kal Skirata for the Grand Army of the Republic on an advisory level and, while so engaged, "liberated" medical and scientific equipment for use at Skirata's hidden home on Mandalore: Kyrimorut, a budding haven for clones who wished to desert from the Grand Army. He also assisted Skirata in locating scientists who could help find a cure to the clone troopers' accelerated aging; during the search, Gilamar met Dr. Reye Nenilin whom he subtly insulted by comparing him to the ancient Mandalorian scientist Demagol. He aided in the recovery of the wounded clone commando Fi on Mandalore, alongside ex-Jedi Bardan Jusik. When Order 66 was issued to all members of the Grand Army, Gilamar deserted to Mandalore with the rest of Clan Skirata, then rescued Arla Fett, and then recently kidnapped Separatist scientist, Dr. Ovolot Qail Uthan.
            While spending time with Doctor Uthan and working alongside her as she attempted to develop a solution to stop the clones' accelerating aging, Gilamar began to develop feelings for her. He also bonded with escaped Jedi Padawan Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy—known by the nickname Scout—who was taking refuge from the Galactic Empire at Kyrimorut's remote location, teaching her first aid, and developed a fatherly affection toward the girl. Following the Emperor's attack on Uthan's homeworld, Gibad, utilizing the FG36 nanovirus she'd developed personally for the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Gilamar comforted her at the loss of her world. Together, he helped her to create a countermeasure to the nanovirus and when the anti-virus was completed, Gilamar professed his feelings for Uthan and the two kissed. When Scout decided she wanted to stay on Mandalore with Gilamar and Uthan—who had become somewhat motherly toward the young girl—instead of being sent to live with the Altisian Jedi, Gilamar agreed to talk to Skirata on Scout's behalf, assuring her that she could stay despite the fact that she wished to continue being a Jedi.
            When it came time to disperse the anti-virus into the Mandalorian population at large, Gilamar joined several members of the Skirata clan in the capital, Keldabe. While there, he spotted his former Cuy'val Dar associates Reau and Priest—whom he'd seen earlier working with the Imperial occupation force—in a crowd and, upon noticing the Death Watch symbol on their armor, he lured Priest into a conversation that soon moved to an isolated alley. There, he learned that the Death Watch was still active under the leadership of Lorka Gedyc, and were planning to revitalize the splinter group. With this information, and unwilling to allow the brutality of the Death Watch to return, Gilamar attacked Priest, slashing Priest's femoral artery through the gap between Priest's armor plates and letting him bleed out. He then dumped the body into the Kelita River with the aid of Ordo Skirata to delay Reau from discovering it.
            Mij Gilamar was created for an exclusive Entertainment Earth 14 action figure pack. This figure mixes new parts with pieces from existing Jango Fett figures. The figure has new legs, which it shares with B'arin Apma, as well as an all-new head and bits and pieces previously used to make various Jango Fett action figures.
            This figure was first designed to be the Mandalorian training sergeant Kal Skirata, but Karen Traviss thought the head mold looked too young, so she asked Hasbro if they wouldn't mind changing the names. She named this figure after her good friend James Gilmer (Mij is Jim spelled backwards).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mij_Gilamar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMijGilamar</string></dict>

        <key>Antoc Merrick</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.50.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Antoc Merrick was a human male pilot who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Around 0 BBY, General Merrick participated in the Alliance's acquisition of the Galactic Empire's plans to their ultimate weapon, the Death Star, in the Battle of Scarif, flying a T-65B X-wing starfighter as leader of Blue Squadron. However, he was shot down and killed during the battle.
            Antoc Merrick was born in 46 BBY on Virujansi. Merrick served as the flight leader of the planetary defense force known as the Rarified Air Cavalry on his homeworld. After the formation of the Galactic Empire, Virujansi experienced a political transformation when an Imperial governor displaced the ruling Virujansi council. This resulted in the forced disbanding of local military forces loyal to the ruling council. Merrick rejected an offer extended to pilots of the Rarified Air Cavalry to join the Imperial Navy seeing it as hollow. Seeing that the Rebel Alliance's starfighter squadrons demonstrated greater unit coherence and piloting ability than those of the Empire, Merrick and fellow pilot Garven Dreis opted for early retirement, left Virujansi, and sought membership with the Rebel Alliance.[1]
            Sometime after joining the Rebel Alliance, Merrick was given the rank of General and direct authority over all assembled starfighters at the Base One on Yavin 4. He also would fly in command of Blue Squadron as Blue Leader. When the entirety of the Massassi starfighter squadrons were scrambled, Merrick had authority over the other squadron leaders. In Merrick's absence, General Dodonna commanded the starfighter fleet. Additionally, he served on the rebel council allowing him to have sway over the course of the Rebellion.[1]
            Around 0 BBY, Merrick listened to Jyn Erso testimony to the rebel council about Death Star's full power. When the alliance received word of Rogue One's infiltration of Scarif, Merrick and Blue Squadron along with the entire starfighter wing at Base One scrambled to provide assistance. Blue Squadron entered combat above Scarif in conjunction with the Rebel Fleet led by Admiral Raddus. Merrick then led Blue Squadron's X-wings and U-wings through the Shield Gate to provide air support to the pathfinders on Scarif's surface. He and his squadron then destroyed several of the AT-ACTs harassing rebel forces. During the ensuing air combat with TIE strikers, Merrick was shot down resulting in his death.[2]
            A male, light-skinned human, Antoc Merrick had blue eyes and blondish-brown hair.[2] He deeply cared for those under his command, and refused to needlessly risk their lives. Knowing the extra responsibility of others lives that U-wing pilots bear from personal experience, Merrick felt particularly protective towards them.[1]
            As a pilot of the rebellion, Antoc Merrick wore a blue flight suit and helmet while operating a T-65B X-wing starfighter known as Blue One,[2] manufactured by the Incom Corporation.[3]
            Antoc Merrick, portrayed by Ben Daniels, is a character created for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the first installment in the Star Wars Anthology Series, which was released on December 16, 2016.[4] The first footage of Merrick was revealed in the Celebration Europe reel on July 15, 2016.[5] His name was revealed on October 15, 2016 by Entertainment Weekly in an exclusive trading card from Star Wars: Card Trader.[6]
            On page 170 of the 2016 reference book Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, Merrick was erroneously referred to as Davits Draven.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Antoc_Merrick</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAntocMerrick</string></dict>

        <key>Domus Renking</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.53.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Domus Renking was a human male who served as the Senator of Lothal during the reign of the Galactic Empire. As a corrupt and unscrupulous man, Renking was only concerned with enriching himself and acquiring power, even at the expense of others. Taking advantage of the Pryce family's plight, Renking coerced Arihnda Pryce into selling her family company Pryce Mining to the Empire; which enabled him to keep a share of the company's profits.
            Later, Renking knowingly sent Arihnda to deliver a data card containing falsified information to Moff Ghadi. When that venture failed, Renking scapegoated Pryce and sacked her. Renking's actions earned him Pryce's enmity which led to his undoing after she ascended to the Governorship of Lothal. After shutting down Pryce Mining, Pryce tricked Renking into bribing Governor Sanz during a bidding war with Kintoni to host Imperial Navy facilities. This proved to be his downfall and Renking was arrested for bribery.
            Domus Renking was the planet Lothal's Senator during the Imperial Era. As senator, his job was to represent Lothal's interests on the galactic capital Coruscant and looking after Lothalian expatriates working in the mines of Coruscant. He spent most of his time on Coruscant but regularly visited his homeworld for short vacations and meetings with Governor Ryder Azadi and other political and industrial leaders. He was a rival of Governor Azadi and the two jostled for power and control of Lothal's mines.[1]
            After Governor Azadi framed Elainye Pryce for embezzlement in retaliation for Elainye's daughter Arihnda Pryce not giving him a controlling stake in Pryce Mining, Senator Renking convinced Pryce to pin the blame on the Lutrillian heavy equipment inventory operations manager Pomi Harchmak. Since Governor Azadi was determined to acquire Pryce Mining due to a doonium vein beneath the Pryce family mine, Senator Renking convinced a reluctant Pryce to sell her family company to the Galactic Empire in order to prevent Azadi from acquiring the mine.[1]
            As compensation for the loss of Pryce Mining, Senator Renking offered Arihnda a job as an aide at one of his citizen assistance offices on Coruscant. He also offered to resettle Pryce's parents Talmoor and Elainye on Batonn, where their mining expertise was needed. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Pryce accepted Renking's terms.[1]
            For a year, Arihnda Pryce worked for Senator Renking as a staffer at the Bartanish Four Sector supplementary citizen assistance office. During that time, Renking banned his employees from sleeping or living in any of his vehicles after Wapsbur was arrested for doing spice in a public parking area. Senator Renking also did little to help his employees including Pryce find accommodation. Despite Renking's indifference, Pryce did managed to find an apartment in the Bartanish Four Sector.[1]
            During the Ascension Week celebrations, Senator Renking fraternized with several Imperial officers including Imperial Security Bureau Colonel Wullf Yularen, and the Imperial Navy officers Senior Lieutenant Thrawn, and Ensign Vanto in the ballroom of the Alisandre Hotel in Coruscant's Federal District. There, they were joined by Pryce and her friends Driller MarDapp and Juahir Madras.[1]
            After recounting Thrawn's exploits during the Dromedar incident, Senator Renking tasked Ms Pryce with delivering a data card to Moff Ghadi. He told Pryce that Ghadi needed to load the files into a secure datapad, download the files, and then return the card to him. Renking also told her to drop the card in the drop slot once she had returned it. However, Renking did not tell Pryce that the data card had false data on it.[1]
            Pryce did as her employer instructed. Unfortunately, Ghadi saw through Senator Renking's game and sprayed her with an illegal spice called polstine spice. Ghadi then threatened to have her arrested unless she placed the fraudulent data-card in the slot in Renking's desk safe. As a result of Pryce returning the card, Senator Renking's office was implicated in several financial and corporate discrepancies, forcing him to shut down seven offices including Pryce's Bash Four office.[1]
            In private, Senator Renking chastised Arihnda Pryce for letting Moff Ghadi bully her. When Pryce called him out for exploiting her, he demanded that she return her airspeeder key and told her that he had been evicted from her apartment. When Pryce condemned him for breaching her trust, he countered that she was mistaken to think there was trust in politics and quipped that she would be happy back on Lothal.[1]
            A few years later, Governor Azadi was dismissed by the Galactic Empire[1] for supporting the Bridger family's illegal broadcasts.[3] Though Renking was seeking to gain the Governorship of Lothal, his former employee Pryce convinced Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin to give it to her in return for exposing the insurgent leader Nightswan's spy ring on Coruscant and Moff Ghadi's plan to use the Higher Skies Advocacy Group's stolen information on Tarkin against him. Pryce's ascension to the Governorship of Lothal was part of her plan to seek retribution against Senator Renking and Governor Azadi, whose rivalry had cost her family their mine.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Domus_Renking</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDomusRenking</string></dict>

        <key>Jacen Syndulla</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.55.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jacen Syndulla was a male human and Twi'lek hybrid who was born during the time of the Galactic Civil War. He was the son of General Hera Syndulla and the late Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus, and the grandson of Twi'lek revolutionary leader Cham Syndulla.
            Jacen Syndulla was born to General Hera Syndulla of the Rebel Alliance sometime after the liberation of Lothal,[1] which occurred shortly before the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War.[2] His father was Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus,[1] who was killed in combat against the Galactic Empire while saving Hera and their crew shortly before Lothal's liberation.[3] His maternal grandfather was the Twi'lek revolutionary leader Cham Syndulla,[4] a legendary veteran of the Clone Wars and the fight against the Empire.[5]
            Syndulla grew up during the Galactic Civil War, which his mother fought in for the Rebel Alliance.[1] By the time the Empire was shattered in 4 ABY,[6] during the Battle of Endor, the young Syndulla was already considered a member of his mother's crew on the starship Ghost. He was given the callsign Spectre 7.[1]
            Jacen Syndulla was a male hybrid, born to a human father and a Twi'lek mother. He had mostly human features, though his green hair was similar to his mother's green skin, as well as the tips of his ears being green, and his eyelashes also being green. Even at a young age, Hera's old friend and crew member, Sabine Wren, recognized that Syndulla was born to fly just like his mother. He also had blue eyes and light skin.[1]
            Jacen Syndulla was introduced in the epilogue of "Family Reunion – and Farewell," the series finale of Star Wars Rebels.[1] His first name, Jacen, was inspired by Jacen Solo, the son of Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo in the Star Wars Legends continuity.[7]
            The decision to introduce Jacen Syndulla in the series finale was one that executive producer Dave Filoni had been thinking of throughout production on the fourth season. He initially only shared his idea with Kiri Hart, the head of the Lucasfilm Story Group, who was supportive of the character's introduction. Filoni deliberately chose the name Jacen as a way of honoring the character of Jacen Solo and his importance in the stories of Star Wars Legends.[8] Voice actress Vanessa Marshall, however, was unaware about Hera's pregnancy with Jacen when she recorded the final episode, just discovering it during a fan screening.[9]
            Though Filoni says he has not given much thought to where the character might go in future stories, many creatives within Lucasfilm have expressed interest in the future of the character since the Star Wars Rebels finale aired on March 5, 2018.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jacen_Syndulla</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJacenSyndulla</string></dict>

            Prior to the invasion of Naboo,[1] Silman was the personal aide to Republic's Senate leader, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum. Silman was then assigned to assist former Jedi High Council member, Master Sifo-Dyas, with secret negotiations with the Pyke Syndicate on Oba Diah. However, after the negotiations, Silman's and Sifo-Dyas' T-6 shuttle was shot down over Oba Diah's moon by the Pykes, on orders from a man named Tyranus.

            For ten years, Silman was kept in the Pykes' prison as insurance, in case Tyranus, the Republic, or the Jedi discovered Sifo-Dyas's true fate and the Pyke's involvement. Silman became mad, feeding the vermin and lice that shared his cell. He was then found by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Knight Anakin Skywalker, who questioned him as to the identity of the second Jedi who supposedly accompanied and betrayed them.

        <key>Jariah Syn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.58.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jariah Syn was a male Human bounty hunter who was the son of Zareb Syn and a co-pilot of the starship Mynock, the crew of which also included his friends Deliah Blue and Cade Skywalker during the time of the Second Imperial Civil War against Darth Krayt and the One Sith.
            When Syn was seven years old, his father Zareb Syn was slain by the Cathar Jedi Rasi Tuum during the former's raid on the mining world Roon. To honor his late friend, the Feeorin pirate Rav raised Syn in Zareb's stead, and played to Syn's hatred of the Jedi by telling him falsehoods about the Jedi Order. As he grew, Syn learned how to use Yuuzhan Vong weaponry from Chonyo, a Yuuzhan Vong member of the crew of Rav's ship, the Crimson Axe.
            In the aftermath of the Massacre at Ossus, Rav's crew, including Syn, came across Jedi Padawan Cade Skywalker floating in the debris above the planet. Despite misgivings from Rav, Syn, unaware that Skywalker was a Jedi, insisted that Skywalker join their crew. The two became close friends, although Skywalker hid his Jedi background from Syn and the rest of the Crimson Axe crew. At some point, the pair left Rav's crew and struck out on their own, having recruited the Zeltron mechanic Deliah Blue as the third crew member of the ship Mynock.
            In 137 ABY, Syn found himself unwittingly caught up in the Second Imperial Civil War after a job on Vendaxa revealed that his captain was not only a Jedi, but the heir to the Skywalker bloodline. As a result of his association with Skywalker, Syn, as well as Blue, were captured by Imperials and used as pawns in the Sith's effort to turn Skywalker to the dark side. After they were freed, Syn would later come to terms with Skywalker's connection to the Force and would provide backup for Skywalker on his various missions. Syn would subsequently also come to terms with his father's death after encountering Rasi Tuum during a mission at the Hidden Temple and hearing his side of the story.
            Syn's father Zareb Syn was an associate of the Feeorin pirate Rav. When Syn was seven years old, he sneaked aboard a ship his father and Rav were piloting. Their destination was a mining world named Roon, and Rav and the elder Syn were there to perform a raid. Having felt a disturbance in the Force, the Cathar Jedi Rasi Tuum showed up at the location that Rav and Zareb were plundering and tried to defend the miners from the two pirates. Rasi Tuum cut off Rav's leg and slew Zareb Syn in the ensuing confrontation, while a panicked Syn rushed out of the ship to his slain father. Rasi Tuum loomed over Syn, seemingly about to kill him too, but Syn was saved by a blaster bolt fired at the Jedi's chest. To repay his fallen comrade, Rav raised Syn in Zareb's stead. Having been told some falsehoods about the Jedi Order as a whole by Rav, as well as having witnessed his father's death at the hands of a Jedi, Syn developed a strong hatred for all Jedi.[1]
            In 130 ABY, having heard about the Massacre at Ossus, Rav, Syn and the rest of Rav's crew decided to go to Ossus to plunder the Jedi Temple and remove any goods of value from it. Upon arriving, Syn and Rav found Jedi trainee Cade Skywalker floating in the rubble over Ossus. Upon retrieving Skywalker, Rav assumed he was a Jedi and wanted to throw him to the vacuum of space. However, Syn insisted that Skywalker was not a Jedi because he had no lightsaber, and fought to keep him alive because he assumed Skywalker was part of a rival pirate group who might have already been dirtside. Syn reasoned that if they kill Skywalker, they might never know what traps, if any, were put in place. After Skywalker lied about being a trader that knew the layout of the Temple by heart, Rav relented and let him live, but stated he would throw both Syn and Skywalker out of the airlock if Skywalker led them into a trap. Skywalker then led the pirates in plundering the Jedi Temple.[2]
            After the event, Rav decided to take Skywalker on as an apprentice. Syn and Skywalker became close friends, although given Syn's hatred of Jedi, Skywalker never revealed to his friend his last name or the fact that he used to be a Jedi.[3] After many years as Rav's apprentices, Syn and Skywalker became bounty hunters, and Syn joined the crew of Skywalker's ship, the Mynock, as co-pilot. At some point after striking out on their own, the pair recruited the Zeltron mechanic Deliah Blue as their third crew member.
            In 137 ABY, Syn, Skywalker and Blue were contracted by Rav to locate gambler Naxy Screeger. After locating him on the planet Lok, the group also came across a Jedi named Hosk Trey'lis. Savoring the opportunity to capture the Jedi and make more money, Syn attempted to kill the Jedi to make capture easier, but was stopped by Skywalker. After Blue's attempt to capture Trey'lis failed, Syn threw a thud bug at the Jedi's back, and the group left Lok with both Screeger and Trey'lis in tow. [4]
            On their arrival on Socorro, their Jedi captive put up a struggle, but Skywalker was able to subdue him long enough for them to turn their two captives over to Rav. When Rav paid the crew with just enough to refuel the Mynock and buy a few drinks, and gave Skywalker death sticks as a bonus that was added to the crew's tab, Syn was furious. Skywalker then told him that it was his ship and his life, and that if Syn did not like being a part of the crew, he could find a new ship. Skywalker then took his leave, and Syn and Rav had a short argument about Rav's motivations for keeping the crew of the Mynock in debt. Syn accused Rav of using Skywalker's death stick addiction as a way of keeping the crew on a tight leash. Rav replied that he liked having the crew owe him, as it reminded him of the "good old days". When Syn pointed out that he and Skywalker earned their freedom from him and that Rav owed them, Rav replied that the only person he owed was Syn's dead father, and that debt was paid. Syn then received an admonishment from Rav, telling Syn that he'll "always be owned". After the argument with Rav, Syn admitted to Blue that he felt Skywalker had lost his edge as a bounty hunter.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jariah_Syn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJariahSyn</string></dict>
        <key>Peccati Syn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.59.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Peccati Syn was one of the twelve original Grand Admirals of the Imperial Navy. Raised as a devout Sacred Way follower, the young Syn was forced to abandon his religion under Imperial oppression. He joined the Empire to fill a spiritual void, rising through the ranks thanks to his tactical expertise and energetic devotion. After becoming a Grand Admiral in 2 BBY, he fought with distinction in the Galactic Civil War aboard his flagship, the Fi.
            When the Empire began to fragment after the Battle of Endor, Syn again searched for a new source of spiritual inspiration, and found one in the Church of the Dark Side on Coruscant. While officially remaining part of Sate Pestage's faltering Imperial regime, Syn's true loyalty was with the Church and its Prophets, and most of his time was spent on Kashyyyk, the residence of his spiritual guide, Merili. When the New Republic launched a major offensive against Imperial-controlled Kashyyyk eight months after Endor, Syn was embroiled in a tactical confrontation with Admiral Gial Ackbar. Ultimately, the Grand Admiral lost the duel; he died when his ship was vaporized in orbit.
            The male Human Peccati Syn was born on the planet Taris[1] into a deeply religious family, who devoutly followed[4] the pacifist, karmic[5] religion known as the Sacred Way,[4] and its Holy-Book.[5] His parents instilled in him the belief that, should he adhere to his religion's tenets, he would reach a glorious, idyllic afterlife, and Syn lived a happy, devoted childhood. However, soon the Galactic Empire began to enforce its prohibition of religion on his homeworld.[4] Some, such as the Verpine "Pera" on Aduba-3, ignored the mandate and continued to practice,[5] but Syn complied.[4]
            After such a faith-oriented youth, Syn was left spiritually barren, and, bereft of other options, turned to the doctrine of the New Order to fill this religious vacuum. He ardently internalized the Emperor's dogma and enlisted in the Imperial Navy, carving out a name for himself. In 2 BBY, Syn was one of twelve men elevated by Emperor Palpatine to the newly created and highly prestigious position of Grand Admiral.[4] His appointment surprised many in the Empire as there were numerous admirals with comparable service records.[3] Syn's ascension coincided with the beginning of the Galactic Civil War, and he fought the Rebel Alliance with devotion to duty and tactical acumen. He named his flagship Fi, after the High Galactic word for "son" used by Sacred Way clergymen.[4] Syn became close friends with fellow Tarisian Admiral Foga Brill, whom he helped attain governorship of the Deep Core planet Prakith.[1]
            Syn's exalted Empire began to deteriorate after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, in which Emperor Palpatine and his enforcer Darth Vader perished, along with the second Death Star and the Super Star Destroyer Executor. Many Imperials, including some of Syn's Grand Admiral colleagues, turned warlord, seizing personal dominions,[4] but Syn continued to defend his areas of operation and complied with the orders coming out of Coruscant.[3] Former Grand Vizier Sate Pestage was technically Interim-Emperor, though he vied for control with the Imperial Ruling Council and Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard, among others. One of Pestage's acts was to sanction the establishment of the Church of the Dark Side on Coruscant; overseen by the Prophets of the Dark Side, it preached the renewal and regeneration of the Empire.[4]
            Like the hordes of spiritually-starved citizens on the Imperial capital, Syn took to the church fervently,[4] even converting his friend Foga Brill to the religion;[1] no sooner than his Imperial religion had become untenable, a ready-made replacement had cropped up. In truth, the Church was a sham headed by Imperial Intelligence impersonators, founded by Pestage and Lord Cronal in a desperate attempt to strengthen the former Vizier's weakening clutch on the Empire. Nevertheless, Syn was rejuvenated, and while he publicly supported Pestage's regime, his true loyalty lay with the Prophets. The Grand Admiral even attempted in vain to hearten his dispirited colleague Ishin-Il-Raz, lending him a copy of the sacred book Secrets of the Dark Side.[4]
            Syn operated out of Imperial-controlled Kashyyyk, the base of Prophetess Merili. Merili was one of the few genuine Prophets working within the Church of the Dark Side, and she became Syn's spiritual advisor. Entrenched in the church's doctrine, Syn vowed not to turn his back on another religion, and served the church's ends along with Fi and its crew.[4] Eight months after the Battle of Endor, the New Republic embarked on an ambitious offensive into Imperial territory, led by the Mon Calamari Admiral Gial Ackbar. Kashyyyk was targeted; Ackbar brought his New Republic Defense Force fleet to bear against Syn's in orbit over the planet.[6]
            Assured by two Bothans who claimed to be working for the Imperial warlord Treuten Teradoc that reinforcements were being sent from the Greater Maldrood, Syn engaged Ackbar's fleet, unaware that the Bothans were actually New Republic agents and had sabotaged two of his Immobilizer 418 cruisers.[3] Locked in a one-on-one tactical confrontation with Ackbar,[7] the Grand Admiral, fighting with his newfound spiritual resoluteness, did his best, with no concern for his personal well-being or that of his crew.[4] Ultimately, the New Republic outfought their Imperial counterparts,[6] and Ackbar won the tactical duel.[7] The Mon Calamari Star Cruisers Home One and Maria, commanded by Ackbar and Captain Verrack respectively, caught Syn's Star Destroyer—now named the Silooth—in a crossfire and destroyed its bridge with a volley of proton torpedoes,[3] taking with it Syn, his crew,[4] and Merili.[8] The Church did not outlast the late Grand Admiral for long,[6] and soon after wresting control of the Imperial remnants from Pestage, Ysanne Isard reinstated freedom of religion, legalizing the Sacred Way.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Peccati_Syn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPeccatiSyn</string></dict>

            During his youth, Jova Tarkin was taken to endure his family's test in the Carrion Plateau on his homeworld of Eriadu. The lesson was meant to teach select Tarkin males the importance of what their family had built and the necessity to force others to abide by the imposed law, by force if need be. The Carrion was maintained as a way to show the Tarkins what Eriadu had been like before their ancestors had arrived from the Core to colonize their world, and to show them that 'life remained a constant battle for survival'.[1]
            Once his initiation was done, Jova took the unexpected decision to remain in the Carrion to make it his home and become a permanent guide and mentor for future Tarkin initiates. This decision made him the first of the long line of Tarkins to choose to remain in the Carrion. In this capacity, Jova came to train his own nephew and his great-nephew, Wilhuff, when the time for their initiations came.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jova_Tarkin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJovaTarkin</string></dict>
        <key>Garoche Tarkin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.62.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Garoche Tarkin was a Human male who served in the Imperial Navy since the earliest days of the Galactic Empire. A scion of the wealthy and influential Tarkin family of the planet Eriadu, Garoche was the son of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. Shortly before his disappearance around 19 BBY, Garoche had reached the rank of admiral and was in command of a Imperial I-class Star Destroyer.
            Following in the footsteps of his father, then-Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, Garoche Tarkin enlisted into a military academy, thus also keeping in tradition with his family's strong support for military service. While training at the Academy, he befriended his rival and fellow cadet Shale. By 19 BBY, he was serving the Galactic Empire as an admiral and commanding officer of a Imperial I-class Star Destroyer.[2]
            Barely after the fall of the Old Republic and the rise of the New Order, Admiral Tarkin was tasked with eliminating insurgents in the Ghost Nebula. However, the mission had apparently been a failure, resulting in the disappearance of both the admiral and his vessel. In order to find and retrieve his missing son, Grand Moff Tarkin requested the aid of Emperor Palpatine. Much to the dismay of Tarkin, however, the Emperor's Sith apprentice Darth Vader was tasked with the mission to find Garoche. In the event that Vader became distracted from his primary objective, as had happened in the past when faced with hunting down Jedi fugitives, Tarkin attached Captain Shale to the mission.[2]
            In actuality, Garoche defected to Atoa in part due to a deep resentment of the atrocities he had to commit in the name of Palpatine, and aided in its insurgency after the Lady Saro, High Priestess of Atoa, forgave him for his crimes. The pair became lovers, and Saro conceived his child. Captain Shale had followed him into defection, with the former seeking to kill Lord Vader, but failed and ended up dead. He later appeared with Saro after the latter removed the ghostly image of Padmé Amidala, Vader's wife. Garoche and Saro then persuaded for Vader to repent of his sins. Vader ultimately killed them both in an attempted suicide by collapsing the cathedral they were in to atone for his sins as Vader. However, he ultimately survived, blaming Garoche's death on the Atoan Insurgents, part of a plan with the Emperor to deepen Wilhuff Tarkin's hatred and make him a better tool of the Empire.[1]
            True to Palpatine's plans, Garoche's death led to his father committing genocide against the Atoans as revenge for their perceived part in his demise.
            Ultimately, however, Garoche and Shale would prove to not be the only Imperials disgusted with having to commit several atrocities in the Emperor's name. The Imperial Academy headmaster, Gentis, would orchestrate a military coup against Palpatine shortly afterwards in order to stop him and his warmongering ways.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Garoche_Tarkin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGarocheTarkin</string></dict>

        <key>Thall Joben</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.64.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Thall Joben was a popular speeder racer during the early years of the Galactic Empire. Along with his racing partner, Jord Dusat, he briefly came into ownership of the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO while they were separated from Raymus Antilles.
            From an early age Joben and Dusat shared a passion for constructing and racing speeders, and together they began to run a speeder shop on Ingo. During the Jedi Purge, a customer brought his speeder in for some repairs and never returned to collect it. A search of the vehicle revealed a lightsaber which Joben kept. It is unknown what happened to the lightsaber's original owner.
            Joben and Dusat began constructing White Witch, a speeder which they intended to enter in the Boonta Speeder Race. While racing through the desert on Ingo, Joben and Dusat came across R2-D2 and C-3PO who had been dumped by their previous master shortly before he was arrested for smuggling. White Witch required an astromech droid to assist the driver and R2-D2 was ideal for the role so Joben and Dusat became the droids’ new masters.
            While returning home with the droids, the racers passed close to a secret base where the Fromm Gang were developing a weapons satellite, Trigon One, which they planned to use to overthrow the other gangs. Fearing that the intruders would reveal the base's location, Tig Fromm dispatched sentry droids to attack them. The two racers escaped with the assistance of Kea Moll who was on a mission to locate and destroy Trigon One.
            Agreeing to assist Kea in her mission, they were able to break into the secret base and steal Trigon One. Joben hid the weapons satellite in a forest on Ingo but when Sise Fromm kidnapped Dusat and Kea's mother he agreed to reveal the location in exchange for their release. Tig Fromm went to retrieve Trigon One, but Joben and R2-D2 had sabotaged the guidance system causing the ship to collide with and destroy Sise Fromm’s base on Annoo.
            The group traveled to the Boonta Speeder Race but the Fromm's attack on their ship damaged White Witch and injured Dusat, forcing Joben to take over as driver for the race. Seeking revenge, Sise Fromm, who was owed a favor by Boba Fett, recruited the bounty hunter to kill the young racers. Proto One, a droid they met on Boonta, offered to assist in repairing White Witch but C-3PO suggested the superior facilities offered by BL-17, unaware that the droid was working for Fett.
            When BL-17 and Boba Fett sprung their trap, Joben escaped in White Witch and headed for the race, which was about to start. However, Tig Fromm had planted a thermal detonator on White Witch which was set to go off at the end of the race. Boba Fett followed Joben to the race course, pursuing him throughout the race. Fett's attack loosened the thermal detonator which fell off and attached to Fett’s pursuing speeder. Fett ejected in time, though his speeder was destroyed. Joben went on to win the race.
            After the race, Joben and Dusat were approached by Zebulon Dak, owner of Zebulon Dak Speeder Corporation, who offered them jobs designing and engineering speeders. Company policy would have necessitated a memory wipe for R2-D2 and C-3PO so they decided to decline. Unwilling to stand in the way of their masters’ dreams, R2-D2 and C-3PO left in an escape pod shortly before their ship went to hyperspace, freeing Joben and Dusat up to take the jobs.
            In Star Wars: Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO, Thall Joben was voiced by Andrew Sabiston.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thall_Joben/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascThallJoben</string></dict>

Shortly after Solo's arrival, many of the castle's occupants were drawn outside to view the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon. The First Order then attacked and destroyed Kanata's castle. While at the castle, Tuyll wore black boots and brown clothing, including a pair of gloves and a cap. His left eye was covered by an eye patch and he had fair skin and brown hair.[1]

        <key>Armitage Hux</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.69.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Armitage Hux was a human male general in the First Order military during the cold war and subsequent conflict with the Resistance. A member of High Command, Hux answered directly to the First Order's ruler, Supreme Leader Snoke, granting him far greater authority than his rank would indicate. He was a young, ruthless military officer who rose through the chain-of-command but his ambitions extended far beyond his present status. Believing he was destined to rule the galaxy, Hux longed to see the day when his technological innovations brought about the fall of the New Republic and the Resistance, allowing the armies of the First Order to establish an era of military rule not seen since the Age of the Galactic Empire.
            Born around the time of the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY/0 ABY, Hux was the illegitimate son of Commandant Brendol Hux, an Imperial Academy instructor who sired Armitage with a kitchen woman. In the years following the Empire's defeat in the Galactic Civil War, the younger Hux followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an officer as well as a proponent for the training of soldiers who were conscripted at birth. As a result, Hux oversaw the rise of a new generation of stormtroopers, the training of which drew inspiration from the Republic clone troopers and the original stormtroopers. In addition to an army programmed for absolute loyalty, Hux revived another idea behind Imperial doctrine—establishing military superiority through technological terror, this time in the form of the planet-killing superweapon known as Starkiller Base.
            The era of the New Republic ended in 34 ABY; with Starkiller Base operational, Hux persuaded Snoke to authorize its use against the Core World Hosnian Prime. Both the planet and its neighboring worlds in the Hosnian system were annihilated by the power of Starkiller, resulting in the destruction of the Republic capital, the Galactic Senate, and a large portion of the New Republic Defense Fleet. Although the base was lost in a subsequent battle with the Resistance, Hux was confident that, without the Republic, the galaxy would fall to the military might of the First Order. Although Hux secretly aspired to succeed Snoke as Supreme Leader, his plans were obstructed by the accession of his rival Kylo Ren, a dark warrior who seized power in the aftermath of Snoke's assassination. Hux initially opposed Ren's claim on the throne, but was forced to pledge his allegiance to him after the new Supreme Leader almost asphyxiated the general by way of the Force.
            Armitage Hux[8] was born on the planet Arkanis[1] around the time of the Battle of Yavin, approximately 0 BBY/0 ABY, during the reign of the Galactic Empire.[2] Commandant Brendol Hux was his father, although Brendol's wife, Maratelle Hux was not his mother, making Armitage the bastard son of Brendol—a consequence of an extramarital affair between his father and a kitchen woman.[8] Even as a child, Armitage harbored notions of grandeur, believing it was his destiny to rule the galaxy.[9] His father, on the other hand, had a low opinion of Armitage, whom he regarded as a frail and weak-willed boy.[8] Knowing that Brendol disliked his own son, Grand Admiral Rae Sloane suspected that Armitage was abused psychologically and even physically by his father.[6]
            Armitage was living on Arkanis when the armed forces of the New Republic besieged his homeworld[8] in 5 ABY,[10] attempting to secure control of the Arkanis system. At the behest of Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, Sloane ensured that neither Armitage or Brendol became prisoners of the Republic. She therefore employed the services of the bounty hunter Mercurial Swift to facilitate their evacuation before Arkanis fell to the Republic.[8] Unknown to the Grand Admiral, Rax was in the process of carrying out the Contingency—a secret plan devised by the Emperor Palpatine to destroy the Empire in the event of his death. Rax also intended to see the Empire reborn in the Unknown Regions, and therefore, regarded the Huxes, Armitage in particular, as valuable assets in his plans for the future.[6]
            Following the Attack on Chandrila, Armitage followed his father Brendol to the planet Jakku. Gallius Rax had proclaimed himself Counselor to the Empire and brought the Imperial remnants to the desolate world for a final showdown against the New Republic. In the months leading up to the Battle of Jakku, Armitage kept away from Brendol, who physically and psychologically mistreated him. Brendol trained 24 local orphans into Rax's personal guard of child soldiers.[6]
            After the Battle of Jakku had commenced, Armitage traveled with his father, Counselor Rax, the Adviser Yupe Tashu, and the child soldiers aboard a transport to the Jakku Observatory. The Observatory was a secret facility in the Plaintive Hand plateau which was instrumental to the later Emperor Palpatine's Contingency plan. Rax planned to detonate the planet Jakku along with the New Republic and Imperial forces. He planned to take Armitage and his father Brendol into the Unknown Regions to rebuild the Empire.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Armitage_Hux</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascArmitageHux</string></dict>
        <key>Hark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.70.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hark was a male Mandalorian human who served as a captain in the Imperial Super Commandos. Hark commanded the Imperial convoy that transported Alrich Wren but was ambushed by renegade Mandalorian and Rebel Alliance forces. Hark later received orders from the Mandalorian Governor Tiber Saxon to withdraw Clan Saxon and the Empire's forces from the battlefield so that Saxon could test the Duchess on the renegades. He later objected to Governor Saxon's plan to strengthen the weapon on the grounds that the Empire would eventually turn it against all Mandalorians. For his objections, Saxon shocked Hark with the weapon. After Saxon was incapacitated when the rebel Sabine Wren adjusted the weapon to affect Imperial armor, Hark fled.
            Hark was a captain in the Imperial Super Commandos during the Imperial Era. The Imperial Super Commandos served as the soldiers of Clan Saxon, an Imperial-aligned Mandalorian clan that ruled Mandalore on behalf of the Galactic Empire. Following the death of Viceroy Gar Saxon in 2 BBY, Mandalore was plunged into civil war. Saxon's brother Tiber Saxon succeeded him as Governor. In 1 BBY, Hark commanded an Imperial convoy that was tasked with transporting Alrich Wren to the capital Sundari for execution. Clan Wren had risen against Clan Saxon with Alrich's wife Countess Ursa Wren killing Governor Saxon after he tried to murder her daughter Sabine Wren, who had joined the the rebellion.[2]
            On the way to Sundari, the Imperial convoy was attacked by Clan Wren forces under Ursa and her son Tristan. Hark redirected the Imperial Troop Transport carrying Alrich plus two others and a detachment of scout troopers on speeder bikes, stormtroopers, and Imperial Super Commandos to a canyon. Captain Hark then informed Governor Tiber about avoiding the rebel attack. Tiber responded that he would be sending "reinforcements". Hark then taunted his captive Alrich about enjoying Sundari's architecture for the last time. While Captain Hark believed that he had escaped the renegade Mandalorian forces, he did not know that Countess Wren had deliberately redirected the convoy into a canyon where a joint rebel-Mandalorian forced led by Sabine, Fenn Rau, and Lady Bo-Katan Kryze was lying in wait.[2]
            The renegades and rebels ambushed the convoy, quickly overpowering the Imperial and allied Mandalorian escorts. During the fighting, Captain Hark was thrown out of his transport by the Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger, a friend of Sabine and member of the Rebel Alliance. After the renegades had rescued Alrich, Hark contacted Governor Saxon and informed him about the successful rebel attack. Tiber responded that the rebels had planned well and ordered him to withdraw all remaining Imperial forces since he was going to deploy the Duchess, an Arc Pulse Generator capable of reacting with the beskar alloy inside Mandalorian armor and incinerating their wearers.[2]
            After Grand Admiral Thrawn advised Governor Saxon that he needed the Duchess's creator in order to realize the weapon's full potential, Tiber assigned Hark to capture Sabine. When Sabine led a joint rebel and Mandalorian strike team on a mission to destroy the Duchess aboard Tiber Saxon's Star Destroyer, Hark and Governor Saxon trapped Sabine and the former Mandalorian Regent Bo-Katan Kryze inside the weapon's store room. Tiber demanded that Sabine fix the weapon in order to strengthen it and unleashed the weapon on her and Bo-Katan when she refused.[2]
            When Hark objected on the grounds that the Empire could use the Duchess against Mandalore, Saxon unleashed the weapon on him as well. Governor Saxon then gave the three Mandalorians some respite. Sabine pretended to comply but reset the weapon to target stormtrooper armor. Since Governor Saxon was wearing stormtrooper armor, he was affected. Sabine toyed with killing Governor Saxon but Bo-Katan convinced her not to descend to the Empire's level. After Sabine slashed the Duchess with the Darksaber, Hark took the opportunity to flee before Saxon's Star Destroyer exploded and crashed.[2]
            Captain Hark was a human male Mandalorian warrior.[1] As a member of the Imperial Super Commandos, he wore Mandalorian armor that covered him from head to foot. He had a dim opinion of Alrich Wren and taunted him about marveling at Sundari's architecture before his impending execution. Hark later objected to Governor Tiber Saxon forcing Sabine to strengthen the Duchess on the grounds that the Empire could use the weapon against Mandalore. For this, Saxon unleashed the weapon on him. After Sabine destroyed the Duchess, Hark took the chance to escape.[2]
            Hark first appeared in Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore, where he was voiced by Andrew Kishino, who also voiced Saw Gerrera in Star Wars: The Clone Wars.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHark</string></dict>
        <key>Harridax Kirill</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.71.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Harridax Kirill, also known as the Voidwolf, was a male Human who served as a Grand Admiral of the Imperial Navy during the Great Galactic War, the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic.
            Harridax Kirill was one of the Empire's most feared leaders. He started his career as a brutal criminal slaver on the Outer Rim before becoming an Imperial privateer.
            His underworld experience made him an especially effective "dirty fighter," but also antagonized the Imperial Armada's aristocratic officers who preferred to conduct war according to accepted strategies. He became ambitious enough to plan to take control of the galactic underworld for the Empire. The Voidwolf cemented his position with the Empire by capturing a Jedi vessel filled with Force-sensitive children. He personally led the boarding party that killed the Jedi defenders and took the young Padawans-to-be prisoner. When he delivered this "gift" to the Sith on Korriban for training, they promoted him from independent privateer all the way to the rank of Navy commander.
            During the Cold War, Imperial agent Darmas Pollaran had brokered a deal with Republic Senator Bevera Dodonna to betray the Republic. However, Rogun the Butcher caught wind of their dealings and had managed to imprison both individuals on Port Nowhere, only to be freed by a smuggler, who was an enemy of Rogun's. The two then spun a story that Rogun's a servant of the Voidwolf, convincing the smuggler to become a Republic privateer.
            The Voidwolf kept his distance as he relayed missions for his lackeys to pass to the smuggler. After the smuggler completed a job on Balmorra, they went to Quesh to assist a group of privateers being grounded by the Voidwolf. When the smuggler stormed the Imperial base that tagged any unauthorized ship that attempted to leave, the Voidwolf was monitoring by hologram and chastised Commander Flayn for failing to notice that the smuggler was right behind him. The Voidwolf mocked the smuggler, revealing that he knew everything about the smuggler. Flayn then attempted to kill the smuggler, only to be killed in turn.
            Ultimately, the smuggler joined with Vaz Traniff to raid the Imperial treasury ship, King's Ransom. When confronted by the smuggler, the three Moffs onboard called the Voidwolf for assistance. The Voidwolf did not hesitate to remind them that he outranked them. Though the Moffs reminded him that he was bound by the rules of warfare to send reinforcements, the Voidwolf revealed that the Republic and Empire had officially gone to war, and he exploited Article 17 of the Ziost Convention to justify destroying the King's Ransom just to kill the smuggler. However, his foe managed to escape.
            Deciding to continue exploiting the smuggler after they saved Dodonna from another of Rogun's bounty hunters, the Voidwolf planned on taking Rogun out of the picture. After the smuggler completed jobs on Belsavis and Voss, he finally confronted Rogun at his safehouse on Tatooine. At the same time, the Voidwolf sent two Pureblood Sith, Chane and Desora, to confront the two and reveal his deception. He assumed that two Sith would easily handle two criminals, but the smuggler and Rogun partnered up and survived the betrayal.
            The Voidwolf then went to Corellia, influencing corrupt Corellian Councilor Caicos into convincing the Corellian Council to succeed from the Republic. However, the smuggler had followed the Voidwolf to Corellia, and with Republic aid, exposed Pollaran, forcing Dodonna into hiding. But as the Senator was exposed, the Voidwolf felt he had no more use of her and had her indentured. The Voidwolf remained on his flagship, the Harrower-class dreadnought Regnant, in orbit, managing to amass a pirate fleet so he could attack the Republic shipyards and then invade the Core Worlds. However, the smuggler had managed to get onboard his flagship via Caicos' shuttle. Confronting their enemy on the bridge, the smuggler publicly challenged the Voidwolf for control of his pirate fleet and defeated him. The Voidwolf tried to flee, throwing a grenade at his opponent, but the smuggler threw the grenade back, killing the Voidwolf and assuming control of his fleet.

            After a long and successful tenure as an executive with the largest starship manufacturer in the galaxy, Harlon retired from active control of the company to a more prestigious and influential position as the manufacturer’s representative on the Corellian Corporate Council–a group comprised of major industry leaders devoted to influencing Corellian politics to corporate advantage.
            When the Sith Empire conquered Corellia he decided to oppose the Sith and entered in the resistance, becoming a leader and a very important financier. So Darth Tormen sent his hunter to capture him. Cornered by the Hunter in his own office, Fane attempted to bribe the mercenary to show leniency. The Hunter was willing to consider his offer if he cleared the huge bounty on the Hunter's head. Fane feigned compliance, before activating his personal shield and ordered his security guards to subdue the Hunter. However, his guards were no match for the Mandalorian. Fearing for his life, Fane pleaded to be spared, promising to leave Corellia but the Hunter wouldn't have it, as Tormen needed him. Seeing he had no options, Fane deactivated his shield and surrendered. The Hunter later presented to Tormen Harlon Fane frozen in carbonite. As he is unfrozen, Fane is forced by Tormen to sign a treaty dictating Corellia's secession from the Republic. After signing the treaty, he is executed for treason against the Empire.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Harlon_Fane</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHarlonFane</string></dict>

He sacrificed himself during the Battle of Umbara.
            Hardcase was a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett.[1] According to Hardcase and his commander on Kamino, his growth acceleration chamber had a leak in it, which resulted in Hardcase developing a hyper-active attitude.[6] Hardcase eventually became a soldier in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic's 501st Legion.[5]
            Hardcase fought during the Battle of Mimban lead by Jedi General Laan Tik. During the battle, Tik was killed by a blaster bolt. Jar Jar Binks was then made leader of the Republic's forces.[7]
            In 21 BBY, General Grievous captured Jedi Master Eeth Koth. Koth was freed and Grievous was stranded on the nearby planet Saleucami. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi led clone troopers of the 501st and 212th Attack Battalion to find and capture Grievous. During the mission, Hardcase rode a BARC speeder with fellow 501st troopers Captain Rex, Kix, and Jesse. Rex was injured by a droid and Hardcase and the others decided to drop him off at a farm while they continued their mission.[4]
            In 20 BBY,[2] Hardcase and the 501st were deployed to fight in the Battle of Umbara under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. While Skywalker led the initial assault, he was called back to Coruscant and replaced by Pong Krell. When the majority of the troopers believed that Krell was out of control, Hardcase accompanied two other troopers in an attempt to destroy a droid supply ship. When Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase disobeyed orders and participated in the rogue operation, he sacrificed his life to destroy the supply ship.[3]
            Like the rest of the 501st Legion, Hardcase wore Phase II clone trooper armor with blue markings. His weapon of choice was a powerful, rapid-fire z-6 rotary blaster cannon.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hardcase</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHardcase</string></dict>

        <key>Galen Walton Erso</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.77.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Galen Walton Erso was a human male scientist and leading galactic authority on crystallography and energy enrichment. Born on the planet Grange, an agricultural backwater world, Erso was drafted into the Republic Futures Program, where his skill and intelligence ultimately led him to becoming a critical, if reluctant, component in the development of the DS-1 platform. In doing so, Erso managed to subtly sabotage its design in a way that ultimately proved disastrous for the Galactic Empire.
            One of the most renowned polymaths in the galaxy, Galen was a gifted theoretician, mathematician, and experimental physicist. Galen was a recipient of the Kuat Systems Engineering Medal, the Ashgad Prize and the Roche Foundation Prize.
            Galen Walton Erso was born on the agricultural backwater planet Grange to a human mother and father as an only child in 56 BBY.[2] Growing up in a poor neighborhood, Galen demonstrated high intelligence from an early age. His mother, first to recognize her son's genius, supplied him with whatever he needed to keep his mind busy when credits weren't tight; first providing him a music synthesizer, chemistry set, and later whatever datacrons she could find. Upon entering primary school, Galen outlearned his fellow classmates and quickly grew bored. Galen's mother, eager for Galen to learn of the broader galaxy, subscribed him to a HoloNet service. By secondary school, Galen's teachers described him as a "prodigy." Galen excelled in the mathematics and the sciences, learned numerous languages and magic tricks out of pure curiosity, and built his own primitive HoloNet transceiver.[1]
            In school, Galen won the Grange subadult science and engineering fair scholarship.[2] Often coming up with academic formulas and theories that surpassed his understanding and mystified his instructors, one of his solutions was eventually submitted offworld by a mentor. This submission brought Galen into the attention of the Republic Futures Program, a program designed to collect the "best and brightest" students from across the stars to become the Republic's next generation of leaders, scientists, and citizens.[1]
            At the urging of his mother, Galen wound up in the Futures Program on Brentaal in 40 BBY.[2] While enrolled, he received word that his mother had died of a short illness, and, only a few years later, that his father had died in a vehicular accident. Following these losses, he soon became best friends with architecture student Orson Krennic in 36 BBY. By graduation, Galen graduated with top honors in the Brentaal Futures Program materials competition.[2] Following graduation, Galen wound up taking advanced studies, research internships, and teaching positions. During this time, Krennic helped Galen land a visiting professorship at the Institute of Applied Science on Coruscant, which came with a good stipend and free apartment. By twenty-five Galen had published prolifically and had earned a reputation for himself in the fields of crystallography and energy enhancement.[1]
            Galen traveled the galaxy on research missions searching for rare crystals to use to supply power. By the time Krennic has helped him get the professorship at the Institute of Applied Science his focus had become kyber crystal research. In 26 BBY during an expedition on Espinar in search of rare crystals, such as kyber crystals, Galen met his future wife, Lyra. By the end of the six month expedition, the two were lovers. A year later in 25 BBY,[2] Galen married Lyra on Coruscant. Sometime later, the two were trapped in a crystal cave on Chandrila, where Lyra's knowledge of the wilderness led to their survival.[1]
            While many of Galen's colleagues pursued government research, Galen refused to pursue military research because of his pacifistic principles, and instead took a contract with Zerpen Industries to continue his studies into crystal synthesis and energy enrichment. Born to hardworking parents and seeing the wealth disparity in the galaxy, Galen sought to examine the very structures of existence to see if he could unlock unlimited energy and even the divide between the have's and have not's.[2] Galen hoped to find a way to provide clean, safe, and nearly unlimited power to developing worlds by unlocking the secrets of the kyber crystal. Months before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Galen and Lyra relocated to the Outer Rim world of Vallt, where Zerpen Industries had arranged a deal with Vallt's King Chai, who allowed the construction of a research facility to grow synthetic crystals in the hopes of creating a new source of inexpensive power.[1]
            By the start of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY and before leaving for Vallt, Lyra was already pregnant with their future daughter, Jyn. Shortly afterward, Vallt's Republic-aligned King Chai was overthrown in a coup by forces loyal to Marshal Phara, who received military support from the Separatist Alliance. Galen and Lyra were hunted down by the Iron Gauntlet Legion, and Galen was imprisoned in a Vallt security complex after their failed escape attempt from the Valltii riders. Lyra was kept in nicer quarters in the northern wing of Vallt's Keep. While imprisoned, Galen was offered a chance to serve the Separatists for their freedom. Galen refused, but was willing to accept their offer if his wife willed it. The same year, Jyn was born on Vallt, and Galen was released from his cell to see his child with Lyra, who both chose the name Jyn in agreement. Galen did grow close to his captors, and they considered the scientist as one of their own. Members of Vallt's government like Chiefian Gruppe even wanted to keep Galen on Vallt instead of handing him over to the Separatists.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galen_Walton_Erso</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGalenWaltonErso</string></dict>
        <key>Serji-X Arrogantus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.78.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Serji-X Arrogantus was a male Human swoop jockey who toured the professional circuit on Caprioril during the Imperial Period. He was nicknamed "the Arrogant One," due to his continual flagrant disregard for the rules and the dangers of professional swoop racing. He was usurped by the corporate-backed Dug racer Hodrix, and as his fans were rapidly siphoned away from him, Arrogantus attempted an incredibly dangerous stunt, in the hopes of attracting some of the attention he had once enjoyed. The stunt resulted in a perilous crash that almost claimed Arrogantus' life. He was deemed unfit to race, so he left the professional circuit to race with swoop gangs in the Outer Rim Territories.
            Making his way to Aduba-3, Arrogantus formed the Cloud-Riders—a group of reprobates and degenerates who preyed upon the local farmers, exploiting the weak and innocent. Arrogantus in particular targeted the village of Onacra, with whom he had worked out a compromise in which they would pay him a considerable tithe each year, allaying his need to pillage their settlement. However, Arrogantus tired of the arrangement, and returned to his ransacking of the town. In 0 ABY, when attempting to claim one of the farm girls, Merri Shen, Arrogantus and the Cloud-Riders met resistance from a group of gunslingers led by Corellian smuggler Han Solo. Arrogantus was later killed when a large beast emerged from deep caverns near Onacra, wreaking havoc.
            Serji-X Arrogantus was a Human male who had a career as a professional swoop jockey on Caprioril[4] in the Swo-O'Rim racing circuit.[5] He continued that line of work for several years, and earned himself the moniker of "the Arrogant One," due to his flagrant disregard of both the rules and dangers that distinguished the sport of swoop racing.[4] In 22 BBY, he participated in a race in the city of Tasjon on Corulag, against Ignar Ominaz, the top-ranked swoop racer at the time. It was a rare meeting of the two most significant talents in the swoop-racing field, as the Swo-O'Rim circuit rarely overlapped with the TransGal circuit that Ominaz raced in. Although Ominaz won the race, Arrogantus finished nine seconds later. When speaking to HoloNet News after the race, Arrogantus confidently decried Ominaz's abilities, confident that his new Flare-P swoop from Mobquet Swoops and Speeders would give him the requisite edge to secure the top seed. HoloNet News believed that Arrogantus would secure the top seed at the Plooriod 940 on Corsin, a month after the Tasjon race.[5]
            Arrogantus earned a great many fans for his opulent displays and showboating, but he was eventually usurped by the newcomer Hodrix, a Dug hailing from Malastare who had the advantage of corporate backing. Arrogantus' manager took a job with the corporations, leaving Arrogantus alone to deal with his own affairs. In an attempt to regain his former standing, Arrogantus attempted a particularly dangerous and foolhardy stunt. As a result, he suffered a bad accident, and his prize speeder was wrecked. The only thing saving Arrogantus himself from death was his helmet. He sustained severe cranial trauma, and was ruled unfit to race. With his career at an end, Arrogantus made his way to the Outer Rim Territories. There, he participated in races with outlaw swoop gangs, and would relay stories of his former glory to the low-lifes that he was forced to gravitate to. He eventually made his way to Aduba-3, and formed a gang, the Cloud-Riders—a pack of miscreants who utilized stripped down skyspeeders and swoops. They were loyal to Arrogantus only through their own ignorance. As his vehicle of choice, Arrogantus flew a modified Peregrine-340 airspeeder.[4]
            The Cloud-Riders maintained a small camp in the hills near the farming villages of Aduba-3. Arrogantus devised an extortion racket, in which they would prey upon the local farmers to their own benefit. They raided the villages, stealing both crops and women, before selling them to traders and slavers respectively in the port town of Tun Aduban for credits.[4] They would also force the banthas that farmers used for both livestock and transportation to stampede.[2] The closest of their targets was the village of Onacra. Rather than allow Arrogantus to repeatedly ransack their community, the village leaders, among them Oncho Shen and Ramiz, formulated a compromise with him. They would pay him an annual tithe of 9,000 credits, and Arrogantus would bypass Onacra altogether. He and the Cloud-Riders accepted the deal, as it required less hauling of grain and slaves to Tun Aduban.[4] On the second year of their agreement, Arrogantus and his Cloud-Riders made a spectacular entrance into the town, crashing into several of the dwellings for effect.[6] After three years, however, Arrogantus tired of the deal, and prepared to resume his ransacking of Onacra.[4]
            In 0 ABY, a newcomer, Warto, joined Arrogantus' gang. Arrogantus was impressed with the Boltrunian's strength, and his hunger for vengeance against several individuals who had humiliated him in the past. Arrogantus gave Warto a skyspeeder that had belonged to a Cloud Rider that had succumbed to a high-hound attack.[4] Warto alerted Arrogantus to the fact that a Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, had been hired by the Onacrans to defend the village, and to that end had assembled a makeshift team of warriors,[2] later to be known as the Star-Hoppers of Aduba-3.[4] Arrogantus, Warto, and the rest of the Cloud-Riders rode to Tun Aduban to confront Solo, and while the Boltrunian goaded the Corellian, Arrogantus instructed him not to open fire until he had given word.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Serji-X_Arrogantus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSerjiXArrogantus</string></dict>
        <key>Janus Bonn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.79.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Janus Bonn was an Imperial captain and native of the planet Corulag. He was the son of a wealthy noble, attending the best schools and eventually volunteering for service to the Empire upon graduation. Rising through the ranks, he became an assistant to Darth Vader.
            Janus Bonn was born on the Core World Corulag, the son of a wealthy noble. Immersed in the Human High Culture philosophy espoused by the Galactic Empire, he attended the best university available to him, graduating with honors. Upon graduation, Bonn volunteered to serve in the Imperial Military.[1] As a young officer, Bonn was assigned as an assistant to Lord Darth Vader, and his ascension through the ranks of the Imperial Military bore similarities to Vader's own rise; Bonn utilized displays of power, deceit, and even murder[3] to distinguish himself in a relatively short career.[1] He was promoted to the rank of captain around the same time that Lord Vader was assigned to assist Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and the Death Star project.[3]
            Following the Battle of Yavin, Lord Vader was placed in command of a flee charged with tracking down the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Vader assigned Bonn to prepare a trap for the Heroes of Yavin in the Alderaan system, using rumors that the Aldera Royal Palace had been found intact in the debris field of the planet Yavin, and that Bail Prestor Organa was also alive within. In command of two platoons of stormtroopers, Bonn waited at Mining Outpost 11 in the Alderaan system for the Heroes of Yavin to arrive, knowing that Lord Vader would follow. Bonn's goal was simple; when the Rebels arrived, he was to ensure that they did not leave until Vader arrived.[3]
            Bonn was a Human male, who stood 1.8 meters tall. He maintained a thick goatee beard, and was possessed of cold, dead eyes that intimidated his underlings. His stare, combined with his efficient and emotionless attitude, earned him the nickname of "The Dead Man" from his soldiers. His cold, unemotional behavior was a façade, however;[3] inside, Bonn was a seething pit of evil, fear, hatred and violence. When pressed, his composure would slip. The revelation of his true nature was enough for doubt to be cast on his sanity.[1]
            Bonn was a fanatical supporter of Galactic Emperor Palpatine and his New Order, and was doggedly loyal to Lord Vader.[1] Despite his loyalty to Lord Vader, Bonn did not believe in, or respect, the notion of the Force. He respected results, something Vader excelled at, the defeat at Yavin 4 notwithstanding.[3] When given a mission objective, Bonn treated it as the most important thing. To fail in his assignment would invalidate any meaning in his life.[1] Bonn was one of the few officers, along with Commander Daine Jir and Admiral Firmus Piett, who Vader respected.[4]
            Bonn wore a standard Imperial officer's uniform, carried a comlink, and was armed with a blaster and grenades.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Janus_Bonn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJanusBonn</string></dict>
        <key>Yaru Korsin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.80.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Yaru Korsin was a Human male starship captain who served Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow's Sith Empire during the era of the Great Hyperspace War. The son of a respected admiral in the Sith Navy, over a twenty-year career Korsin gained a reputation for being dependable and focused on his job. At the height of the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY, Korsin, commanding the Sith dreadnaught Omen, was sent on a mission to mine valuable Lignan crystals from the planet Phaegon III's largest moon. Accompanied by the Omen's sister ship, the Harbinger, the Sith were surprised by a Jedi attack. As the Omen jumped to hyperspace to flee the skirmish, the ship was bumped into by the Harbinger, knocking Korsin's vessel completely off course. The Omen reverted back to realspace in uncharted territory, and was severely damaged by a gravity well en route. Fortunately for Korsin, the Omen was headed toward a seemingly habitable planet, and to save the ship's precious cargo, Korsin elected to bring the ship down in a mountain range. What resulted was a violent crash—however, Korsin survived, along with his half-brother Devore, sister-in-law Seelah, and his infant nephew Jariad, with more than three hundred other Sith emerging alive from the disaster.
            For the next few days, Korsin and his remaining crew forged a tenuous existence in the mountain wilderness of the planet, Kesh, although the situation grew more dire by the hour. On a trip back up to the shattered Omen to search for a means to facilitate an escape, Korsin came into conflict with his spice-addicted, hotheaded half-brother Devore. When Devore tried to usurp control of the group, the two dueled with both lightsabers and the Force, with Korsin besting his foe and dropping him to his death off a precipice. Salvation soon came for the stranded Sith—a native woman of the Keshiri species named Adari Vaal, on the run from religious trouble, happened across the Sith camp and was convinced to lead them to civilization. Posing as gods returned from the stars, Korsin and the Sith were able to gain the complete allegiance of the fervently religious natives, taking their place as rulers of Kesh. Over the next fifteen years, Yaru Korsin, now the Grand Lord of the Lost Tribe of Sith, married the now-widowed Seelah, who bore him a daughter named Nida—all the while, however, Seelah and Jariad, who had discovered Devore's true fate, secretly plotted to one day eliminate Korsin. In 4985 BBY, the deaths of thousands of Keshiri at the hands of Pureblood Sith leader Ravilan Wroth, along with cunning manipulation by Seelah, prompted Korsin to order the deaths of all the Pureblood Sith that remained in the Lost Tribe.
            Ten years later, Seelah and Jariad's long-awaited vengeance finally came to pass. Near a Sith temple that had been built years prior around the Omen's remains, Korsin and his loyal friend and bridge officer, Gloyd, were attacked by Seelah, Jariad and a group of Sith warriors. While the aged Grand Lord could not overcome his assailants on his own, he received backup from Nida, whom he had secretly trained to be the heiress to his legacy. Although Korsin was mortally wounded, Seelah and Jariad's uprising was crushed. In his final testament, recorded as he lay dying in his old captain's chair, Korsin passed on leadership of the Lost Tribe to his daughter, laying down the groundwork for the group's future. For centuries afterward on Kesh, Korsin would be remembered as a near-mythical hero.
            A male Human, Yaru Korsin was born the son of a respected veteran admiral in the navy of the Sith Empire and a woman named Takara in the years before the Great Hyperspace War. He was descended from a noble house of the Tapani sector that was skilled in commerce and industry. Eventually, they were discovered by the Sith and put to work in those fields, running ships and factories. The Korsin line eventually intermingled with the Dark Jedi, bringing the Force into the family. As a result, Yaru Korsin was Force-sensitive, and became skilled in the dark side. Korsin learned at his father's side, staking out his own future in the Sith navy. While still a cadet, Korsin met his younger half-brother, Devore, for the first time—born to a woman from a planet that Korsin's father had visited during his travels. Less enamored with the prospect of following in his father's footsteps, in 5025 BBY Korsin appealed to the Sith Lords for another assignment. The move proved quite fruitful, as Korsin made captain in five years. Another five years later in 5015 BBY, he won command of a newly-christened Sith dreadnaught named the Omen over none other than his own father. Korsin soon became close friends with his bridge officer, a Houk named Gloyd, whom Korsin valued highly for his preference for focusing on his work rather than moving up the chain of command.[2]
            In 5000 BBY, as the Great Hyperspace War raged across the galaxy, Korsin commanded the Omen on a mission to mine Lignan crystals from the planet Phaegon III's largest moon, which would create war materiel for the Sith efforts on Kirrek. By then, Korsin had been a captain in the Sith navy for twenty years and had earned a reputation as trustworthy. Korsin was given the task by the Dark Lord of the Sith himself, Naga Sadow. Much to Korsin's chagrin, Devore, who was valued due to his position in the Sith mineralogical corps, was placed on the mission alongside his half-brother.[2] Right before Korsin left, his mother sent him a message that told of a premonition that someday he and his descendants would rule over a great people—Korsin would hold on to the recording as he traveled to the Phaegon system.[4] Commanding the mission along with the Kaleesh Saes Rrogon in the Omen's sister ship, the Harbinger, Korsin ordered the bombing of the moon's surface to clear the way for a team of harvester droids to mine the Lignan. Afterward, Korsin saw a droid's-eye-view of the shattered moon, leaving him awestruck. With the massive amount of Lignan being mined and the immense power of the dark side that consequently surrounded him, Korsin felt that the Sith were omnipotent. However, Korsin's reverie was soon interrupted—the Omen and the Harbinger were suddenly ambushed by Rrogon's former Jedi Master Relin Druur and his Padawan Drev Hassin. As the two ships prepared to jump to hyperspace, Korsin noticed odd readings in the Harbinger's jump field, although Rrogon did not respond to Korsin's warnings.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yaru_Korsin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascYaruKorsin</string></dict>

        <key>Iaco Stark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.82.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Iaco Stark was a Human male smuggler and pirate who initiated the Stark Hyperspace War between himself and the Galactic Republic and Trade Federation representatives. After his defeat at the Fifth Battle of Qotile he joined the Commerce Guild.
            Years before the Clone Wars the Republic had known peace for centuries while a few conflicts did burn in scattered patches of the galaxy, none of these conflagrations ever spread into a full-scale war. For this reason, the government came to easily rely on the Jedi Knights, letting its own armies shrink so that the term "Republic military" really described forces cobbled together from sector and systems resources rather than a unified galactic body.
            Taking advantage of this complacency was a cunning young pirate named Iaco Stark. The charismatic and bold smuggler maintained a pirate fleet that raided goods and sold them on the underworld market for considerable profit. He was able to undercut the prices of the Trade Federation, and became a folk hero of sorts to other pirates. Under his leadership, a coalition of smugglers, pirates, mercenaries, bounty hunters and assassins emerged in the Outer Rim. Ever seeking out airs of respectability, Stark named this criminal organization the Stark Commercial Combine.
            At the request of the Trade Federation, the Jedi and Galactic Republic representatives sought to end Stark's campaigns at a conference on Troiken. Paranoid and power-hungry, Stark unleashed a navicomputer virus that crippled the few military ships the Republic had amassed. This led to the Stark Hyperspace War, the last sizable military conflict before the galaxy would become engulfed in a full-scale war.
            Before the battle, Stark had amassed a fleet of ships and used them to steal goods from the Outer Rim Territories and then sell them back at ridiculously inflated prices (although still less than what the Trade Federation set). When he saw that he would lose the war, he betrayed his allies.
            After the battle ended, Stark joined the Commerce Guild, where he served as a legitimate businessman as of 30 BBY, despite the fact that he was now widely reviled in the Outer Rim. Stark became a business partner to the Tionese business mogul Dominic Raynor and for a time he dated the holo-starlet Riva Denais, though following an incident in the Corporate Sector that involved some Zanibar cannibals and a Sith amulet, Denais was reported missing and Stark had a permanent falling out with Raynor. At some point afterward, Stark acquired the Jubilee Wheel, a space station gambling facility situated in the Bright Jewel Cluster, and he subsequently launched a lawsuit against the Wheel, a rival luxury space station that was operated by Raynor. Stark accused the Wheel's operators of 5,073 counts of copyright infringement relating to similarities between the Wheel and the Jubilee Wheel, but Raynor successfully defended the case and proceeded to launch a counter-claim against Stark, seeking damages for suffering and emotional duress. However, after Stark enlisted the help of the celebrity attorney Qimberly Gaitag-Delio, Raynor was forced to give up control of the Wheel.[4] During this time, Stark married Arris Rossum.[3]
            Stark had served with the Commerce Guild throughout the Clone Wars, but again changed allegiances when he saw that his side was losing. The day after the Battle of Coruscant, he jumped ship and fled to the Corporate Sector.
            Afterwords, Stark set up Rossum Droidworks and made a fortune selling droidekas and other droids throughout the sector.[3] He fell fatally ill and became obsessed with creating the Eclipse station at Reltooine.[5] It was there that he was decapitated in an industrial accident in 5 BBY and presumed dead.[3][5]
            When Cross and Elli Stark infiltrated the spacestation, they were confronted by Iaclyn Stark who attempted to warn Elli that she was in grave danger. Iaclyn warned her Iaco was still alive because Iaclyn had grafted his head onto a droid body. Before he could convince her, he was killed by Iaco Stark. Iaco stated that he killed Iaclyn because he was flesh and blood and therefore weak. This was the same reason he chose to be grafted to a droid body instead of a clone. He re-initiated protocol five and ordered the droids present to kill Elli. She and Cross managed to reach the door of the room and attempted to escape only to find themselves face-to-face with IN-GA 44. Iaco ordered her to kill Cross and Elli, starting with Cross first.[2]
            Iaco ordered the droids under his control to subdue Elli while watching IN-GA 44 fire on Cross. He explained his plan for using the Iron Eclipse virus to take over the Galaxy to Cross but became upset when Inga was unable to kill Cross due to the deeply ingrained programming that prevented her from harming Cross. When Cross suggested Inga could eliminate both Cross and Stark by disabling the repulsorlift generators that kept Eclipse station aloft, Stark ordered all the droids under his command to chase down and stop Inga. Cross threw the corpse of Iaclyn at Iaco to distract him while the agent climbed on the back of Iaco's droid body. When Cross tried to strike Iaco in the head with a tool, Stark closed the faceplate on his helmet. Cross then used the tool he was wielding to damage the optical sensors on the faceplate. Stark opened his mask to see and continued to fight Cross. Iaco threatened to go kill Elli in hopes that it would cause Cross to make himself vulnerable. The Imperial agent had other ideas, and lodged a fusioncutter in a cargo sled loaded with fuel cells and sent it on a collision course with Iaco. The resulting explosion knocked Iaco on his back and damaged several of the legs on his droid body. Cross left to try and escape from the sinking spacestation, assuming Stark to be dead. As the Imperial agent jumped aboard the Millennium Falcon to flee the dying station, he heard Stark call his name. Cross quickly entered the ship through the dorsal hatch and sealed it behind him, stranding Stark on top of the Falcon's hull. Han Solo inquired what the extra weight was on his ship and warned the crew it might prevent them from escaping the gravity well of the planet. Cross quickly climbed into the dorsal quad laser cannon and proceeded to blast Iaco Stark in the face, killing him and knocking his corpse off the ship.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Iaco_Stark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascIacoStark</string></dict>
        <key>Ergast</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.83.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ergast was a Sith Lord of the Old Sith Empire. He discovered the technique of Force walk and was the first Sith Lord that was buried on Dromund Kaas. He was the gatekeeper of his own Sith holocron, a simulacrum that was referred to as the "Servant of Ergast". In life, he wielded a purple-bladed lightsaber.
            Lord Ergast was one of the first Sith who was buried on Dromund Kaas, and the first Sith Lord, having been alive thousands of years before the Cold War. Following the defeat of the Empire's forces during the Great Hyperspace War at the hands of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order, the Sith Emperor's fleet fled from the advancing forces to a world where they could be safe from the forces of the Republic and the Jedi. In 4980 BBY, a scout ship from the fleet re-discovered the planet of Dromund Kaas. Subsequently, other Sith in the fleet settled down on the world and proceeded to build a new city, which would serve as the capital of a new and restored Sith Empire. During this time, Ergast's tomb was rediscovered, and the larger Dark Temple built over it. To honor the Sith Lord, a monument was built in honor of Ergast in the new Sith capital Kaas City, bearing an inscription linking modern Sith tenchniques of life and death manipulation and binding to Ergast.[1]
            During the Cold War, Ergast's ghost resided in his tomb within the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas, where he was visited by Lord Kallig, who desired to learn the Force walk to defeat Darth Thanaton. Ergast instructed the young Sith Inquisitor to drink a cup of poison before them, which would not kill them. In some nether realm, Ergast taught all he knew of the Force walk, including the fact that more power could be drawn from an unwilling ghost than a willing one. As soon as Kallig regained consciousness, Ergast added that he would not go with them willingly as he was absorbed by the Sith Lord. Kallig later went on to absorbing the ghosts of Darth Andru, Kalatosh Zavros, and Horak-mul. But drawing on their power in a confrontation with Thanaton proved too much to handle. Ergast then admitted that he forgotten to mention that the Force walk could be damaging if more than one ghost were to be bound.[1]
            Kallig soon sought to find a solution to this sickness before the power became too much or the Sith ghosts threatened to drive them insane. First, on Belsavis, Kallig found a Rakata machine that altered the Sith body to hold the four ghosts' power. But as the Inquisitor journeyed to Voss, Ergast mocked Kallig for thinking that they could be silenced by some magic ritual. As Kallig undertook a dreamwalking experience, Ergast took the form of Urtel Moren and attempted to kill Kallig, but was defeated. Later, with the aid of a Gormak Force shaman named Hadrik, using a dream rock exposed Ergast's true form so he could truly be subdued.[1]
            After Kallig defeated Thanaton and gained his seat on the Dark Council, the ghosts pleaded to be freed but Kallig refused. Cursing the Dark Lord, Ergast vowed they would regain their freedom, but was cut off in mid-sentence as Kallig bound them all.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ergast</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascErgast</string></dict>
        <key>Eneb Ray</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.84.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Eneb Ray was a human male who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. He was a spy for the Rebellion and infiltrated the Imperial bureaucracy on Coruscant, working as a tax collector under the codename Tharius Demo. Under the orders of Princess Leia Organa, Eneb undertook a mission to rescue dissident senators from the Arrth-Eno Prison Complex.
            Ray was subsequently caught up in a failed plot to assassinate the Emperor Palpatine, which resulted in the destruction of the Arrth-Eno prison complex and the deaths of all the senators. The Empire claimed that the rebels had killed the senators in a terror attack. Ray left Coruscant, his cover having been blown.
            Later, his psychological state severely damaged, Ray attacked Sunspot Prison, murdering the Imperials imprisoned there in an attempt to turn Princess Leia into a more ruthless leader. He was defeated and captured by the Alliance. However, he managed to escape during transportation.
            Eneb Ray was an Rebel Alliance operative who lived during the Imperial Era. Following the Battle of Yavin, he infiltrated the galactic capital of Coruscant where he posed as the Imperial tax collector Tharius Demo. On one occasion, "Tharius" visited a business exporter whose business was owing the Galactic Empire considerable taxes in arrears. When the man threatened to bring the rebellion on him, "Tharius" counselled him that his incarceration would hurt his family's ability to pay his taxes. Taking his warning seriously, the man agreed to pay his overdue taxes.[1]
            Later, Ray uploaded shipping and procurement data for the Core sectors to his boss Princess Leia Organa. Organa later dispatched Ray on a mission to extract several Imperial senators from the Arrth-Eno Prison Complex including Nadea Tural who were facing execution. She provided him with maps, relevant access codes, and a ship willing to smuggle them off from Coruscant. Despite believing that the mission was difficult if not impossible, Ray complied with Organa's orders.[1]
            Hitching a ride on an airspeeder, Ray used special electrical gloves to scale the prison tower. Using a grappling hook he managed get in through a ventilation shaft. After taking out a stormtrooper sentry, Ray rescued the senators from their cell only to learn from Tural that the Emperor was visiting the prison.[1]
            Ray then stormed the command center and took the guards prisoner. He subsequently learned that one of the guards Coleet was a fellow rebel agent. With Coleet's help, Ray managed to contact Organa over a secure line and revealed that the Emperor was going to visit the prison and that it was the perfect opportunity to assassinate him. Despite Organa's misgivings, she authorized the mission and dispatched six other agents on Coruscant to help with the assassination attempt.[1]
            Posing as the imprisoned senators, Ray and the other agents met with the Emperor, who arrived on a repulsorlift platform with several stormtroopers and Imperial Royal Guards. Ray and the other rebel operatives sprung their trap and opened fire on the Emperor and his bodyguards. After taking out a stormtrooper with his grappling hook, Ray managed to approach the Emperor only for his quarry to ascend on the repulsorlift platform.[1]
            Ray managed to pursue the Emperor to the landing platform with his grappling hook. Despite the presence of stormtroopers, Ray managed to gun down the man whom he believed to be the Emperor. However, the man turned out to be a double. The real Emperor arrived on a Lambda-class shuttle and attacked Ray with Force lightning.[1]
            During the confrontation, the Arrth-Eno complex exploded; killing all the senators, rebel agents, and Imperials inside. Ray fell from the Emperor's shuttle but managed to survive by using his grappling hook to cling on to a speeder. While escaping the scene, Ray overheard a broadcast by the Emperor claiming that the rebels had murdered the senators in order to prevent them from revealing how they had been coerced into betraying the Empire. Stung by the failure of the mission and having sustained a broken left arm, Ray escaped offworld with the help of his get-away contact, who turned out to be the export businessman whose life he had saved earlier.[1]
            After the events on Coruscant, Ray embarked on a quest for vengeance. Despite surviving his encounter with the Emperor, Ray's face was disfigured and he believed that the Sith Lord's touch would eventually kill him. Regarding the Rebel Alliance's moderate tactics as weak and ineffectual against the ruthless Galactic Empire, Ray came to believe that the Rebellion needed to be more ruthless in waging for against the Imperials. Organa and the Rebel Alliance tried to search for Ray but were unable to find him. Organa was upset at the loss of one of her top agents and believed that he had disappeared.[2]
            Seeking revenge against the Empire, Ray decided to kill Imperial prisoners at the top-secret Rebel Alliance Sunspot Prison, which orbited a star and was protected by a bank of turbolasers.[3] Donning a mask and armor to hide his face, Ray assumed leadership of several battle droids and IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droids.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eneb_Ray</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascEnebRay</string></dict>

        <key>Harn  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.86.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Harn was a human male Imperial officer who served as a commander at the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant in the years leading up to the Galactic Civil War. He oversaw the training of cadets, including Thane Kyrell and Ciena Ree, among others.
            Commander Harn was an instructor at the Royal Imperial Academy on the Imperial capital of Coruscant. Around 4 BBY, he instructed a course teaching Imperial cadets how to operate and maintain their TIE fighters. One class assignment involved students building laser cannons out of spare parts. During one class, the Jelucani cadet Thane Kyrell's laser cannon was found to have been sabotaged. After consulting with the door panel's computer, Harn found that the purported saboteur was fellow Jelucani Ciena Ree.[2]
            Ciena was summoned to Commandant Deenlark's office. Ciena's friend Jude Edivon found evidence that the door panel's data log had been tampered with and informed Harn. Harn and Jude submitted the information to Deenlark. Harn listened as Jude explained her theory that whoever had sabotaged Thane's ship cannon had also sabotaged the door panel. She speculated that Kyrell had perpetrated the sabotage in order to keep up his high class rankings. Deenlark accepted Jude's theory and penalized both Thane and Ciena. In fact, the laser cannon incident had been staged by the Academy's Office of Student Outcomes in order to discourage local loyalties and to redirect the cadets' loyalties towards the Galactic Empire.[2]
            Harn was an Imperial commander who served as an instructor at the Royal Imperial Academy, specializing in teaching cadets how to operate and maintain their TIE fighters. He was a stern instructor who did not smile and sometimes murmured in class. Harn expressed anger when he discovered that another cadet had purportedly sabotage Thane's TIE fighter cannon. He supported Jude's theory that someone had sabotaged both the TIE fighter cannon and the door panel's data log.[2]
            Harn first appeared in Claudia Gray's 2015 junior novel Lost Stars, which was released as part of the Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens multimedia promotional franchise.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Harn_(Imperial)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHarn</string></dict>
        <key>Elrik Vonreg</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.87.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Elrik Vonreg was a human male First Order TIE Fighter Pilot. During the era of the New Republic, Vonreg held the military rank of major baron in the armed forces of the First Order. A skilled starfighter pilot, he fought a New Republic squadron of T-85 X-wing starfighters led by Kazuda Xiono as well as a Resistance T-70 X-wing starfighter piloted by Commander Poe Dameron.[2][3]
            Despite his efforts, however, Major Vonreg was forced to break off his attack and return to Starkiller Base where he reported to Captain Phasma. As a result, the New Republic managed to transfer intelligence to the Resistance, and as such discovered that the First Order was operating in secret on the Outer Rim planet of Castilon. The Resistance dispatched a spy, the newly recruited Kazuda Xiono, to investigate.[3] Vonreg was killed by Xiono during the Battle of Castilon when he was shot down.[1]
            Major baron Elrik Vonreg was a ranking officer and TIE fighter pilot in the armed forces of the First Order. Utilizing his own personal TIE Interceptor, Vonreg engaged a squadron of New Republic T-85 X-wing starfighters at one point in the waning months of the cold war. The New Republic pilots had acquired critical information pertaining to the First Order's operations in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories, and had been instructed by New Republic Command to deliver the intelligence to the Resistance. Vonreg, attempting to thwart their mission, drove off two of the pilots, Mia Gabon and Hugh Sion, although Kazuda Xiono remained behind to await the Resistance's arrival at the rendezvous point.[2][3]
            With the arrival of Resistance Commander Poe Dameron, Vonreg was forced to break off his attack on Xiono and engage the Resistance pilot in a dogfight. However, he was ultimately outmaneuvered by the teamwork of Dameron and Xiono, resulting in damage to his starfighter. As a result, the major retreated into hyperspace, eventually returning to Starkiller Base in the Unknown Regions. In failing to prevent Xiono from completing his mission, the Resistance learned of the First Order's interest in the Colossus, an aircraft refueling station located on the ocean planet Castilon. The Resistance, therefore, recruited Xiono to serve as their spy on the Colossus, hoping to gather more intelligence on the First Order.[3]
            Vonreg and Commander Pyre presented the idea that pirates be hired to attack the Colossus, in order to force Captain Imanuel Doza, the platform's owner, to invite the First Order in as security. However, after an attack by Kragan Gorr and his gang failed, Vonreg, along with Captain Phasma, expressed his disappointment in the outcome when the pirates reported in afterwards.[5]
            Sometime after the attack, Vonreg visited the Colossus on a freighter delivering a much-needed shipment of fuel to the platform, in order to speak with Captain Doza. Vonreg insisted to Doza that the Colossus was vulnerable to pirate attack, and made several veiled threats to him. Doza did not take the First Order's offer, noting that they would have to do better than one shipment of fuel to buy him. Shortly after leaving Doza's office, Vonreg became aware that someone had been spying on the meeting using a pair of matched comlinks, as when the two comlinks were brought too close together and both active they produced feedback. Vonreg hear this and spotted the spy, Kazuda Xiono,[6] but unknown to Vonreg this was the same pilot who he had fought against in space.[3] Vonreg ordered his stormtroopers to capture Xiono, who fled. After Xiono managed to evade the troopers, Vonreg confronted Doza, who was incredulous about the thought of there being a spy on his platform. After Doza's daughter Torra claimed the intruder had merely been a friend of hers, who had gotten lost on his way out of Doza Tower, Doza ordered Vonreg to leave with his troopers.[6]
            Sometime later, Marnia Un'la'na, an informant of the First Order, was on the Colossus prior to the All Aces Battle Royale. She was contacted by an Ugnaught associate who stated that they had an urgent message, and met with them in a hangar. After conversing on Un'la'na transmitting the data, she told the Ugnaught that it would be a covered transmission and that they could tell Vonreg that he'd get his information.[7]
            Elrik Vonreg was a human male.[2] As a military pilot, he was willing to engage multiple adversaries on his own.[3]
            Serving with the First Order Navy, Major Vonreg was a skilled pilot whose abilities were acknowledged by Mia Gabon and Poe Dameron. The major could engage multiple opponents, such as a squadron of starfighters, without the support of wingmates. He was also capable of engaging Dameron in a dogfight for a time.[3] He proved himself to be a capable shot with a blaster in a melee with pirates whom the First Order had double crossed. Vonreg additionally possessed some political ability being able to negotiate with Captain Doza of the Colossus, allowing a First Order security force to be stationed on the Colossus at Commandre Pyre’s recommendation.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Elrik_Vonreg</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascElrikVonreg</string></dict>

        <key>Jost Ellon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.89.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jost Ellon was a young Human male who lived on Dodz as a scavenger during the Imperial Period. His family was killed by the planet's governor, Kugg, who imposed his will upon the populace through the use of a killer droid named the Destroyer. Ellon would constantly rail against Kugg's rule, arming himself with a blaster pistol as he attempted to eke out a living by repairing whatever he could scavenge. Among the items he gathered was an outmoded Ranger X-One defense robot, although Ellon initially did not know of the unit's true nature as a defensive unit.
            Circa 15 BBY, Ellon came across two droids, C-3PO and R2-D2, who had traveled to Dodz to serve the crystal merchant Lott Kemp. As Kemp had fled Kugg's rule, Ellon decided to employ the droids himself, and put them to work lifting any heavy items that he could scavenge. C-3PO managed to identify Ellon's X-One unit, and R2-D2 managed to activate it, although its state of disrepair meant it could only function in a limited capacity. Nevertheless, Ellon used the X-One to confront and defeat Kugg's Destroyer, with the assistance of R2-D2. The damage sustained by the R2-series astromech droid during the encounter, however, could not be repaired on Dodz, and so Ellon was forced to part with his two latest acquisitions.
            Jost Ellon was a young Human male growing up on the remote planet Dodz during the Imperial Period.[1][3] The planet was ruled over by Governor Kugg, whose taxes punished the merchants of Dodz. The governor ruled with an iron fist, and would deploy a killer droid named the Destroyer to inflict grievous harm upon those who refused to pay the taxes. Among the first casualties of Kugg's rule were Ellon's family, leaving the young Human alone and orphaned.[1]
            The loss of his family gave rise to an anti-establishment attitude in the young Ellon, who was prone to suspicion and violence towards those in gubernatorial service. He resided alone in a cave, distant from any settlement, and from there he scavenged what material he could from abandoned scrapyards and the like. Ellon would repair whatever he could and then sell it—he earned enough to maintain his standard of living. An issue that the young Human faced, however, was that he could not identify all of the items that he had recovered,[1] among them a large box marked "X-1" in High Galactic.[1][4] The box was so heavy that Ellon had to employ the use of a sled to bring it back to his cave.[1]
            Circa 15 BBY,[2] Jost Ellon took his landspeeder to the property of crystal merchant Lott Kemp, who had recently abandoned the planet to escape Kugg's reign. At Kemp's lot, Ellon hoped to scavenge anything of value. There, he chanced upon two droids who were hoping to serve Kemp—the astromech droid R2-D2 and the protocol droid C-3PO. Suspecting them to be agents of Kugg, Ellon placed the newcomers in the sights of his blaster pistol, and demanded to know their identities. C-3PO obliged, confirming that they were indeed there to serve Kemp—satisfied, Ellon put the droids to work loading some of the scavenged material onto his landspeeder, while decrying the administration of Kugg. Ellon divulged the reason behind Kemp's absence to C-3PO, before preparing to depart in his landspeeder. A thought occurred to the young man however, and he swiftly offered the two waylaid droids a job of heavy lifting. The newcomers, eager to assist, accepted, and joined Ellon in departing the area.[1]
            The trio arrived at Ellon's cave in due course, and the droids were set to work bringing the scavenged material in. The young Human went about explaining to the droids the loss of his family and his meager scavenge-and-repair business, lamenting his inability to identify some of the objects. C-3PO and R2-D2 in turn offered to assist in that regard—Ellon, pleased, asked them to clarify the nature of the "X-1" box. On the sight of it R2-D2 retreated into a nearby crate, while C-3PO explained that inside was a Ranger X-One defense robot, which the protocol droid speculated had been used by the crystal cave miners for defensive purposes, as the unit was designed to ward off any hostile activity.[1]
            Ellon was delighted, hoping that the X-One would prove a match for Kugg's Destroyer. C-3PO elaborated on the defense robot's history—they had been outmoded at the time of the Intergalactic Law Agency's inception, and the protocol droid speculated that the recall of Ellon's unit had been ignored. Ellon explained that the Intergalactic Law Agency had taken no action against Kugg, and asked R2-D2 to activate the robot. The astromech attempted to do so, but found that the X-One had corroded power cells. In frustration, Ellon kicked the large box, which in turn prompted the "box" to transform into the active X-One defense robot. The young Human was overjoyed at the development, but C-3PO speculated that the unit had expended most of what little energy it had left transforming.[1]
            Despite the state of disrepair into which the X-One had fallen, Ellon nonetheless sought to pit the robot against the Destroyer, and prepared to gatecrash a meeting of the Citizen's Council of Dodz. Upon reaching the Council Dwelling, Ellon, R2-D2, C-3PO and the X-One found that one of the building's walls had been torn open. The young Human quickly consulted with the Head Councilman, Althon—the Citizen's Council had just been terrorized by Kugg and the Destroyer. Ellon argued that now was the time to resist the governor's rule and fight back with the help of the X-One robot, but Althon would have none of it, telling the young Human to get rid of the defense unit lest Kugg learn of it and launch reprisals. Althon's argument was countered by an old man, who called on Ellon to carry out his intention of bringing an end to Kugg's reign, as their forefathers had done to men of similar ilk in years prior.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jost_Ellon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJostEllon</string></dict>
        <key>Zez-Kai Ell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.90.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zez-Kai Ell was a male Human Jedi Master serving on the Jedi High Council during the Mandalorian Wars. He was close friends with fellow Jedi Master and Council member Kavar. He was killed on Dantooine by Darth Traya along with Kavar and Vrook Lamar.
            Ell was one of the Masters on the High Council during the Mandalorian Wars. He was also one of the Masters that banished Meetra Surik from the Jedi Order. His own Padawan fell to the dark side during the Mandalorian Wars, but Master Ell did not blame his apprentice for choosing to go to war because he understood why his apprentice followed the Jedi that went to fight. When they banished Surik from the Order, he thought that the Council had thrown away an incredible opportunity: to understand why so many Jedi leave the Order and see if there is anything wrong with their teachings.[1]
            After the Jedi Civil War, with the onset of the First Jedi Purge, Ell went into a voluntary exile on Nar Shaddaa in an attempt to escape detection by the Sith. While he knew about the bounty G0-T0 put on the remaining Jedi, he did nothing to stop him. But Surik later arrived on Nar Shaddaa to find him and stop G0-T0. When Mira, a bounty hunter Ell hired to protect Surik, was captured, Ell finally came out of hiding and decided to help the Exile stop G0-T0.[1]
            After G0-T0's yacht was destroyed, Surik and Ell were finally able to talk. He told her many things, including his own doubt in the Order's teachings, and about his decision to leave the Order. When the subject of Revan came up, he told her that he believed redemption had not actually been Revan's choice, despite the fact that he had learned his identity, and the fact that he had kept to the way of the light side before the destruction of the Star Forge, though it is likely from the context of his statement he may have been referring to the mind-wipe itself.[1] Thus, he was indicating that redemption was not Revan's choice, but rather the choice made by his programmed counterpart.
            He believed that the Council had committed a crime in inserting a new identity over Revan's dead mind, despite how much they benefited from a Jedi-controlled Revan. He also told Surik that she had done the right thing to take action and fight in the Mandalorian Wars, when so few Jedi had followed her example.[1]
            Soon after Surik sought him out, he gathered with Masters Vrook Lamar and Kavar at the rebuilt Jedi Enclave to answer Surik's questions. Ell was eventually killed when Darth Traya used Force drain on him and the other Masters to strip them of their connection to the Force, after they tried to sever Surik from the Force in order to seal the breach she had created but he and the other Jedi Masters could not survive without it and died.[1]
            Zez-Kai Ell was more openly thoughtful and introspective than some of his fellow Jedi Masters, and was quick to state his belief that the Jedi Council's inaction led to Revan's fall - even going as far to say that blame was not solely on the Jedi who left to fight, but on the Council as well. After the Jedi Civil War, he no longer considered himself a Jedi, claiming to have left the Order in disgust with both the Jedi Order and himself.[1]
            Indeed, when the Exile met him, he appeared to have fallen into a  depression, displaying something close to a death wish at times during their conversation. Despite this feeling of disillusionment, he still remained loyal to the Order, and continued to trust in Master Kavar's plan to draw out the Sith by finding the Exile.[1]
            Zez-Kai Ell was a master of advanced Force forms and an expert at lightsaber combat, practicing Ataru, Shien, Niman and Juyo. He wielded a violet-colored double-bladed lightsaber.[1]
            He was voiced by Billy Brown.
            If the player chooses to follow the dark side in Knights of the Old Republic II, the Exile and Ell fight on Nar Shaddaa, a battle during which the Exile kills him and learns his lightsaber combat technique. The Exile can still choose to kill Ell should the player take the light-side path.
            It is possible that Master Ell was not privy to the knowledge that Revan did eventually learn of his true identity but still remained loyal to the Jedi and the Republic. This could partly be the reason he did not believe Revan's redemption was his own choice. Though it is also possible that he may be referring to the reprogramming that gave Revan his new identity rather than the events surrounding the Star Forge.
            In Star Wars: The Old Republic you can craft his double-bladed lightsaber, if you have sufficient skill in Artifice. In this game it is orange rather than purple.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zez-Kai_Ell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZezKaiEll</string></dict>

            Eislo was born into nobility and developed a fascination for the Sith, believing that the Force was the ultimate power in the galaxy, and that the Sith were the only people who were unafraid to wield the power that the Force granted. He therefore desired to become a Sith apprentice, so he studied Sith holocrons and used his family's wealth to sponsor archaeological digs at Sith sites.
            However, he wasn't sensitive to the Force and couldn't become a Sith apprentice, regardless of how many Sith artifacts he amassed. However, he heard legends that the mask of the ancient Sith Lord Darth Nihilus could grant the wearer the power to use the Force, so he desired to find it.
            Along with the Apex Society, an organization of Sith devotees that Eislo led, he tried to track the mask and eventually traced the mask to the planet Volik. Eislo and the Apex Society traveled to Volik, and Eislo promised the Society members that he would become their master when he possessed the power of the mask.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Collan_Eislo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCollanEislo</string></dict>
        <key>Eckard Lokin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.93.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Eckard Lokin, also known as Fixer Fifteen, was a Human male doctor of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War.
            Eckard Lokin was thought to have been born on Dromund Kaas during the pre-war years, at some point studying biochemistry and medicine, and worked as a science and medical adviser to Kaas City military police during this period. He subsequently received a doctorate, and following the breakout of the Great Galactic War, he was present on the Imperial dreadnaught Warhammer and was one of two individuals aboard who evaded capture when Republic soldiers boarded. Lokin was first identified as Fixer Fifteen during Operation: Red Cell, which saw the Republic Strategic Information Service keeping a dossier on his activities.
            Lokin was apparently well-acquainted with the former Imperial agent known as Keeper that went on to become the Minister of Intelligence, noting that the Minister had his eternal respect. During the pre-war years he was also a friend and technical adviser to Cipher Twelve whom he had met in the Old Guard before the agent's assassination, and expressed their shared interest in Mirialan cuisine, during a conversation with the agent known as Cipher Nine in the war that followed over a decade after the Treaty of Coruscant.
            He was known for conducting extensive research on the Rakghoul plague and created a custom variant, unique to his DNA, that allowed him to switch between Human and Rakghoul forms at will, while retaining the same personality and intelligence.
            Cipher Nine encountered Lokin on Taris in Nasan Godera's laboratory. While Cipher Nine's mission was to investigate a Jedi called Ki Sazen, Doctor Lokin falsely claimed he was sent by Watcher Four for a clean up operation, and to catalogue the contents of Godera's lab. The two decided to pool resources to complete their missions. Cipher Nine eventually discovered Sazen was searching for Nasan Godera's Ultrawave Transmitter, a device that she hoped to use to control the rakghouls and make them into her own personal army. Since Sazen was also hunting Doctor Ianna Cel, Lokin offered to be captured by Sazen in her stead by posing as Doctor Cel's assistant. Once taken to the Ultrawave Transmitter, he signalled his location to Cipher Nine. After Cipher Nine dealt with Sazen, the agent then discovered a Rakghoul savagely killing some armed Nikto, which soon transformed back into Doctor Lokin who explained that he freed himself to examine Sazen's laboratory. After handing the Ultrawave Transmitter to Cipher Nine, he promised to provide further explanation of his history once they had regrouped at the Imperial Command Center.
            Lokin explained that he was studying the Rakghouls for some time and his true goal on Taris was to review Sazen's stolen research. Lokin surmised that the agent was working without official sanction just as he was and considering both had secrets harmful to each other's careers in Imperial Intelligence, both agreed to an alliance that benefited both parties. Lokin moved aboard the agent's ship and worked extensively in its medical bay, though was officially semi-retired. While travelling with the agent, he scavenged data on the Rakghoul plague and conducted experiments on himself to further his research.
            Agents from Project Protean were scouting the safe houses of Doctor Lokin in order to eliminate him. This was because he was conducting his own research on the Rakghoul virus. One of their operatives and two genetically enhanced human agents were killed on such a mission by the safe house's booby traps and died in an explosion. This led to a period of investigation by Lokin who discovered the existence of the project and their involvement in Vector's Joining. Thus, he departed with Hyllus to deal with the matter. Both Lokin and Vector assaulted Project Protean's HQ and "interviewed" the woman in charge to gain answers. Lokin discovered why they desired his demise and how his research was used to further Project Protean and Vector had his files deleted and stopped further Killik experiments. In return for sparing their laboratory, Lokin became the new head of Project Protean.
            During the Eternal Empire's Conquest, the Agent went missing. Soon afterward, Lokin retired to a small plantation on Alderaan with his tamed rakghouls. Soon he became terminally ill from his rakghoul disease, until he received aid from the Outlander and was recruited into their Alliance, dedicated to bringing an end to the Eternal Throne.
            Eckard Lokin serves as a companion for the Imperial Agent class in Star Wars: The Old Republic MMORPG, and later for all classes as a whole as part of the Knights of the Fallen Empire expansion. He is voiced by Anthony Cochrane.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eckard_Lokin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascEckardLokin</string></dict>

While Jari was checking the sentries on Corellia, Aelan began to attack his own friend with the Force. It was revealed that Aelan was a Child of the Emperor, however, when Jari dueled him, he sensed no darkness in him.

Jari sensed that there was still good in Aelan and part of himself was still inside, trying to fight his way back from the dark side. The Jedi eventually found Aelan in the factory and tried to save him. Aelan was willing to avenge his brothers and sisters of the Emperor and engaged the Jedi in a duel. Aelan proved no match for the Jedi and was defeated. After his death, Jari rushed in and mourned the lost of his friend. He sensed that his friend was free and became one with the Force.

        <key>Edrison Peavey</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.96.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Edrison Peavey was a human male captain in the First Order Navy during the war against the Resistance. A veteran of the Galactic Empire, Peavey went on to serve as a military officer in the armed forces of the First Order approximately three decades after the Empire's ultimate defeat in the Galactic Civil War. As a member of the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer's senior staff, Peavey served under the command of General Armitage Hux—the illegitimate son of his contemporary, General Brendol Hux. Although he regarded his commanding officer as an example of nepotism and incompetence, the Imperial veteran was a professional officer who kept his opinions to himself.
            Belonging to the generation of Imperial veterans who founded the First Order, Edrison Peavey survived the fall of the Galactic Empire[3] which, in turn, led to the rise of the New Republic at the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War[5] in 5 ABY.[6] A contemporary of General Brendol Hux,[3] the founder of the First Order stormtrooper training program,[7] Peavey served with Hux's[3] illegitimate[8] son, General Armitage Hux aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer.[3] He was at the general's side when the First Order Navy deployed a fleet of Star Destroyers to the planet D'Qar, where Peavey noted that their forces had caught the Resistance in the middle of an evacuation.[2] Peavey's comment irritated Hux, who regarded the older officer as a relic of the Imperial Era.[4]
            Under normal circumstances, Peavey commanded the Finalizer in Hux's absence due to his status as the command ship's captain. This time, however, he was transferred along with his general to the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy—Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship—following the Resistance's escape from D'Qar.[4] Utilizing cutting edge technology to track the Resistance fleet through hyperspace, the First Order pursued their prey to the Crait system but was unable to eliminate them outright,[2] much to Hux's aggravation.[4] Peavey informed[2] his younger commanding officer[3] that the Supremacy was too slow due to her size; while the Resistance could not escape the Star Dreadnought, they could at least keep their smaller starships out of the turbolasers' range. The First Order maintained their pursuit of the Resistance, forcing their vessels to burn through their fuel reserves. Meanwhile, Hux ordered Peavey to have the Supremacy's gunners continue the barrage, wanting the Resistance to know they were still being followed.[2]
            The Resistance's support ships were destroyed one by one, leaving the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus vulnerable and dangerously low on fuel. Upon learning that the Raddus was merely a distraction, Hux ordered Peavey to ignore the Resistance flagship and concentrate the Supremacy's turbolasers on the group of transports ferrying the Raddus's crew to the planet Crait. Peavey noted the Raddus began changing course but Hux ordered him to ignore the cruiser, believing it was only attempting to draw the First Order's attention away from the transports. By the time they realized that the Raddus was preparing to enter hyperspace while facing in the Supremacy's direction, it was too late. Despite their efforts to save the Supreme Leader's flagship, the Raddus crashed through the Supremacy at lightspeed, tearing the Dreadnought in half and damaging several Destroyers in the process. However, both Peavey and Hux survived the attack and deployed the First Order army to Crait where the Resistance took refuge in an outpost that once belonged to the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[2]
            Peavey and Hux oversaw the Battle of Crait from the command shuttle of Kylo Ren, the dark warrior who succeeded Snoke as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order. Although their forces decimated the Resistance and captured the base, the war for the galaxy would continue as a small group of survivors escaped from the battle aboard the Millennium Falcon.[2]
            As a veteran of the Galactic Empire, Edrison Peavey upheld the principles he gained through his service in the Imperial Navy and therefore regarded the chain of command with the utmost respect.[1] Retaining his sense of professionalism as an officer of the First Order,[3] Peavey typically maintained a rigid, unimpeachable posture while on duty.[4] He also kept his personal opinions of General Armitage Hux a secret due to the latter's status as his commanding officer. Having watched Hux's rise to power through unscrupulous methods and nepotism,[3] the Imperial veteran harbored contempt for the young general whom he saw as an arrogant schemer with a poor grasp of tactics.[1] Despite his dislike of Hux, Peavey was careful to keep his face expressionless while Commander Poe Dameron made a fool of the general.[4]
            Although Peavey believed Hux was capable of defeating the Resistance, he felt that it was only a matter of time until the general proved himself unfit to wield the authority that came with his rank. In Peavey's view, Hux was an incompetent officer and an intemperate leader—a revolutionary, filled with fire and fervor, yet one whose glory was fleeting. While he also had a low opinion on Hux's late father Brendol, whom he regarded as a madman, Peavey believed that the elder Hux had a better grasp of military etiquette than his son.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Edrison_Peavey</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascEdrisonPeavey</string></dict>
        <key>Aggadeen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.97.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Aggadeen was a male human who served as an officer in the Galactic Empire. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, he acted as the Imperial Overseer to Weapons Factory Alpha on Cymoon 1.
            A few weeks after the Battle of Yavin, Aggadeen was stationed at Weapons Factory Alpha on the moon Cymoon 1, in the Corellian Industrial Cluster. An envoy was sent from the Outer Rim planet Tatooine. The envoy was employed by the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and was to negotiate terms of shipping raw materials from Hutt controlled space to Imperial factories, to produce more Imperial war machines—such as TIE/ln space superiority starfighters and All Terrain Armored Transport walkers.[1]
            Aggadeen and a squad of stormtroopers awaited the shuttle that carried the Outer Rim envoy on one of the factory's landing platforms. The Overseer ordered the stormtroopers to kill the members of the envoy if they felt in any way suspicious. Three humans and an astromech droid emerged, and Aggadeen greeted them in the name of Emperor Palpatine and asked who he had the honor of addressing. The clear leader of the group called himself the official emissary of Jabba the Great, Mightiest of all Hutts, but his name was Han—Han Solo. The pair shook hands as Solo dubbed the Overseer "Aggie." The Imperials' LOM-series protocol droid confirmed Solo's identity, and Aggadeen invited them into the factory—after they had left their weapons outside. The two parties walked through the factory where Solo and "Aggie" conversed about the imminent negotiations. Solo told him that they should be prepared for the negotiations to be vigorous, but Aggadeen revealed to the small time smuggler that there would be no negotiations. The negotiator would state the Empire's demands and they would be accepted by the Hutt's envoy—the Empire was huge, they had no time to negotiate with criminals or anyone who could possibly slow down the Empire. Solo was unimpressed and reminded "Aggie" that negotiating with criminals from the Outer Rim was not the Empire's style. The Death Star battle station undoubtedly cost billions of credits to build—many years to construct, had been destroyed, running the Empire's resources dry.[1]
            They soon arrived at the room where the negotiations were to be held, Aggadeen invited them inside to await the negotiator. But Solo professed to hold the negotiations on the noisy factory floor. Aggadeen questioned Solo's sanity and asked why. Solo smoothly replied that "Aggie" had said it earlier, "We aren't here to negotiate." Solo's astromech droid began leaking fluids onto the floor—the droid then electrocuted the liquid; and the stormtroopers who now found themselves standing in it. Solo and his "bodyguards" defeated the remaining stormtroopers in hand-to-hand combat. Aggadeen had decided that Solo truly was insane and asked "What kind of envoy are you?" Solo replied "The Rebellious kind." and asked "Aggie" the direction to the main power core. Aggadeen refused to tell them, Weapons Factory Alpha was the most heavily guarded base in the galaxy. Solo ignored him and repeated his question; the proud Imperial officer refused to cooperate—until the astromech droid threatened to electrocute him as well. "Aggie" pointed them in the right direction and was thanked by the female bodyguard with right hook across his jaw.[1]
            The Rebels moved on and rigged the power core to explode as the negotiator, Darth Vader, arrived and was alerted to the Rebel's presence when he was attacked by a sniper. Vader put the entire moon on alert. The rebels freed several slaves and commandeered an AT-AT walker. They used the walker to wreak havoc in their escape of the factory that was now a bomb. Aggadeen and other Imperials attempted to halt the power core's meltdown—but the Rebels had done their work well—the meltdown could not be stopped. Aggadeen contacted Lord Vader and requested permission to evacuate the facility. Vader vetoed his request and told him "If this factory explodes, you had best explode with it." Aggadeen obeyed and was again cautioned by Vader that further failure would not be tolerated and that the Rebel invaders had to die. Vader did not want Luke Skywalker dead, however, as the Sith Lord had other plans for him.[2]
            After the assault ended, Vader returned to the Imperial Palace on Coruscant, the capital of the Empire. He brought Aggadeen to the Palace with him, where the Dark Lord had the Overseer tortured as a consequence for the assault on Cymoon 1. Vader wanted to make sure Aggadeen was not withholding any more information on the Rebel attack that he could possibly use to find Skywalker. Vader brought Emperor Palpatine before the Overseer, and Vader told his master that Aggadeen would never fail the Empire again.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aggadeen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAggadeen</string></dict>

        <key>Havet Storm</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.100.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Havet Storm was the young Rebel agent who stole the Death Star superlaser plans for the Rebel Alliance. He later joined the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker, where he was killed by the Dark Jedi Desann.
            Born on an unknown, but well populated planet on the outer edge of Imperial space, Havet Storm never had a place he could truly call home. His mother, driven by an unknown fear, never dared reside on one planet or system long enough to be found by their shadowy pursuers, successfully sheltering her son from their hidden past and from his hidden heritage until he was approximately fifteen years of age.[1]
            At this time Storm's mother fell ill, her exhaustion and grief finally overtaking her. Searching through his mother's meager possessions, seeking anything that would comfort her, the boy came across a small K-9 series droid, named Arf. Although it was little more than a child's toy, Havet was strangely drawn to it. Picking up the droid he activated an audio recording; the voice of a man who identified himself as his grandfather Morvet Storm.[1]
            The message was a recording of Morvet's last moments of life before he was found and killed by Darth Vader and his agents as part of Emperor Palpatine's Purge of the Jedi following the formation of his Galactic Empire. Knowing he would soon become one with the Force, Morvet explained that he was a Jedi and that this heritage lived on in his grandchild too. The long dead Jedi had hidden within the droid another gift for the boy—the weapon of a Jedi Knight, an orange-white bladed lightsaber.[1]
            Havet's mother, on her death bed, confirmed Morvet's story shortly before dying, telling her son that his father, although untrained and a cripple, had also been killed by the Empire for the potential he carried within him. Afraid and completely alone, Havet packed his lightsaber, Arf, and what few possessions he could carry and left the planet. Eventually, Havet found himself on the planet Korphir, finding work as a mind-reader until his friends grew suspicious and fearful of his strange abilities and forced him to leave the planet. Haunted by this narrow escape and the memory of his grandfather's frantic, spluttered final words "Havet... the dark side... the death of all Jedi. Never reveal... never...". Havet swore to abandon his heritage, never to use the Force again.[1]
            Shortly after this Havet bought transport on a junk-flyer to Toprawa, knowing it to be the site of an important Imperial base and reasoning that there could be no better place to hide than right under the Empire's nose.[1]
            Once he arrived on the planet Havet fell into his usual routines: eating, getting a job and finding a place to lay low. But Storm's hopes of a safe, quiet life on Toprawa were cut short when he mistakenly insulted the bounty hunter Boba Fett at Al the Alchemist's cantina. Refusing to back down from what he saw as nothing more than a common bully, Havet seemed to have bitten off more than he could chew. Luckily their confrontation was cut short when a battle broke out in the sky above the city, Rebel ships attacking an Imperial convoy in orbit around the planet.[1]
            Not long after arriving on Toprawa, Havet became acquainted with the beautiful Facet Anamor, Executive Personnel Officer at the Imperial Research Station. It was then that Havet was approached by the Toprawan branch of the Rebel Alliance. Their leader Vermilion explained that the plans to the superlaser for the Empire's horrifying new superweapon the Death Star were being held within the Imperial base.[1]
            Havet agreed to help the Rebels, using his relationship with Facet to gain access to the base and steal the plans. Once they were in Rebel hands, Vermilion attempted to broadcast the superlaser plans to Princess Leia onboard Tantive IV a Rebel ship that was orbiting the planet, but was fatally wounded in an ambush by Facet and a unit of stormtroopers. In the ensuing confusion Havet struck down Facet and, while fellow rebel Surna comforted Vermilion in his final moments, Havet broadcasted the superlaser plans to the Rebel Alliance.[1]
            Their mission a success, the Rebels evacuated their troops from the Imperial base and detonated a series of strategically placed explosive charges, destroying the base and all record of the transmission, effectively covering their tracks. However, Havet was sure that through the dust and debris he had seen the wounded Facet Anamor fleeing the devastation.[1]
            After the attack on the Imperial base Havet Storm became a staunch supporter of the Rebel Alliance, spending the next two years carrying out various missions on the planet Toprawa and eventually taking command of his own unit. But despite the Toprawan rebels best efforts, the Empire continued to whittle away at their numbers. Then one fateful day Imperial troops discovered the location of the Rebel's base and launched their final attack. Havet and Surna, now close friends, managed to survive the attack and escape to safety.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Havet_Storm</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHavetStorm</string></dict>
        <key>Roan Shryne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.101.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Roan Shryne was a Human male Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars and briefly avoided Order 66. He wielded a blue lightsaber.
            Roan was born on Weytta to Jen and Jula Shryne. Against Jula's will, Jen surrendered the child to the Jedi when Roan was just over three years of age. This action resulted in Jula leaving Jen.
            Roan first faced serious combat as the Padawan of Jedi Master Nat-Sem around 48 BBY. During his early training at the Jedi Temple, Roan demonstrated a talent for being able to sense the Force in others and was encouraged to pursue a course that would have landed him in the Jedi Acquisition Division. When he attained the rank of Jedi Knight, Roan was offered a position within the Division, which took Force-sensitive children to the Jedi Temple, but he refused to do so because part of him was uncomfortable with taking children from their parents. Shryne came to be one of what many Jedi referred to as the "Old Guard", Jedi considered likely to be put on the Jedi High Council. Shryne, however, never attained that status.
            Shortly before the Clone Wars, Roan went on the first of many missions to Murkhana, a world not far from his homeworld Weytta. He sought to bring down the crime lord Cash Garrulan. Instead, Garrulan became a Jedi informant and developed something of a friendship with Roan.[1]
            He would infiltrate this Outer Rim world many more times over the course of the Clone Wars, fatefully returning there in 19 BBY to fight alongside Commander Salvo hours before the end of the Clone Wars and prior to the execution of Order 66.
            Roan was part of the Jedi strike team at the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY. Roan witnessed the death of his former mentor Nat-Sem as well as his first Padawan. His second Padawan was killed in the Battle of Manari in 19.5 BBY. By the end of the Clone Wars, Roan had lost his faith in the Force and the Jedi High Council. A sarcastic and bitter man, his connection to the Force became weak, and he struggled to use even elementary powers, getting by on experience and skill alone.
            Roan fought in the Battle of Deko Neimoidia alongside the 22nd Air Combat Wing, including the Republic commandos of Ion Team. He earned the respect of Captain Climber through the course of battling CIS enemies in various campaigns together. Roan Shryne was one of six Jedi who participated in the Battle of Murkhana, part of the Outer Rim Sieges in 19 BBY, while the Galactic Republic was searching for Grievous following his "failed" abduction of Palpatine. In the midst of the battle, Shryne saved Captain Climber's life while they were performing reconnaissance of a key medcenter that was housing a targeted shield generator. Climber later returned the favor by deliberately misdirecting an ambush per Commander Salvo's orders that would have otherwise killed Masters Roan Shryne, Bol Chatak, and Padawan Olee Starstone, thus sparing them from the initial onslaught of Order 66.
            The trio deliberately allowed themselves to be captured by the Galactic Empire when they were disguised as CIS mercenaries. However, they encountered Darth Vader before they could leave Murkhana. In a duel instigated by Bol Chatak, Vader revealed his overwhelming strength, as he brought Chatak to her knees before decapitating her.
            Fortunately for Shryne and Starstone, Vader was distracted, and they managed to escape Imperial custody due to Shryne's use of a mind trick on an unsuspecting clone trooper. With assistance and a fair amount of deception by Cash Garrulan, the Jedi managed to escape Murkhana aboard a CloakShape fighter.
            They eventually rendezvoused with the Drunk Dancer, captained by Shryne's biological mother, Jula Shryne. Starstone, rather than Shryne, took the lead in gathering together survivors of the Great Jedi Purge. Shryne decided to give up the Jedi way and join up with the smuggler crew under his mother, discarding a lightsaber and his use of the Force in exchange for a blaster and his wits.
            Shryne tried to help the crew deliver Senator Fang Zar from Alderaan to Sern Prime as their first smuggling job together. However, Zar was slain by Vader, who also injured Jula with his saber throw.
            Despite trying to embrace a new life and hide out as suggested by the Jedi Temple on his Jedi beacon transceiver, Shryne's true Jedi nature could not be forever denied, especially in the process of watching Olee Starstone naively falling into the Emperor's traps before his eyes. During a point at the Imperial subjugation of Kashyyyk, Shryne suddenly re-engaged himself as a Jedi Knight, shortly after Darth Vader had landed on the scene via his Theta-class T-2c shuttle, destroying Wookiee warriors and anything else in his path. Specifically, just prior to Shryne's arrival, Vader had dispatched defending Jedi Knights Siadem Forte and Iwo Kulka by beheading them simultaneously in one sweep, critically injured Padawan Klossi Anno and Agricultural Corps members Jambe Lu and Nam Poorf, and shortly engaged Olee Starstone afterwards.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Roan_Shryne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRoanShryne</string></dict>
        <key>Fenn Shysa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.102.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Fenn Shysa was a male Human Mandalorian, born on the planet Mandalore in the years prior to the Clone Wars. Alongside his childhood friend, Tobbi Dala, Shysa joined the two-hundred twelve-man force known as the Mandalorian Protectors, under Spar—"Mandalore the Resurrector." He would fight for the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars and, along with Dala and Spar, survive as one of only three Protectors to remain following a disastrous battle on the planet Norval II.
            Shysa, Dala and Spar returned to Mandalore, where they would remain until the war's end, living to see the Galactic Empire rise to take the place of the Republic. In the face of an Imperial occupation of his homeworld, Shysa adopted the mantle of the new Mand'alor—leader of the Mandalorian clans— and forged a guerrilla resistance to drive the Empire, with its slaving and mining operations, off of Mandalore. After many years of fighting, the Mandalorians finally triumphed against the Imperials when Dala sacrificed himself to eliminate the Suprema, the Imperial commander.
            Although his world was finally free from Imperials, Shysa continued to take the fight to the Empire. He reformed the Mandalorian Protectors and lead them into battle alongside the Alliance of Free Planets during the Nagai–Tof War. Shysa's men played a pivotal role in the Second Battle of Endor, repelling Nagai forces personally led by the Dark Lady Lumiya. Following the end of the conflict and the joining of the Nagai with the Alliance of Free Planets, Shysa traveled to Nagi to liberate the world from the Tof. After a long and distinguished career, including a presence at the Battle of Mindor, Shysa perished on the planet Shogun, saving Boba Fett from death. In his final moments, Shysa would implore Fett to take up the position of Mandalore after his death, a request that Fett would honor.
            Fenn Shysa was born on the planet Mandalore in a small province on the planet's largest continent. Growing up, Shysa became best friends with Tobbi Dala, and the two eventually became local constables. Although the two enjoyed relaxing with a cup of Mandallian Narcolethe, they were not blind to the Galactic Republic's constant disregard for their home planet's well-being. In the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Mandalore maintained their neutrality under the pacifistic New Mandalorians. As Mandalorian traditions lost precedence on Mandalore, Shysa and Dala were eager to begin their fight to restore Mandalore's image.
            Into this environment entered the rogue ARC trooper Alpha-Ø2, now going by the name "Spar". Having defected from the Grand Army of the Republic before it had even left Kamino, Spar arrived on Mandalore with none of the pro-Republic sentiment that had been drilled into his brother clones and became determined to resurrect the Mandalorian Supercommandos. When he began recruiting Mandalorian soldiers from the local police force, and Shysa and Dala were all too eager to sign up. Shysa began to spread rumors across Mandalore that Spar was the son of the late Jango Fett, hoping to utilize Jango's ferocious reputation as a warrior and Jedi killer as a rallying point for their troops and a symbol of fear to all outsiders.[6] He would also encourage Spar to take the title of Mand'alor, becoming "Mandalore the Resurrector" and leader of the Mandalorians. Due to Spar's inherent physical similarities that came with being a clone of Fett, the recruits began to believe him to be Fett's son, and heir to the legacy of the True Mandalorians. Following their new Mand'alor, Shysa and Dala joined other local police and a dozen former Death Watch commandos to form the Mandalorian Protectors, one of the most formidable forces to fight for the CIS during the Clone Wars.[1] Shysa's place as the true power behind Spar was whispered in some circles, though most knew him simply as Spar's trusted follower.
            The Mandalorians first saw action on their homeworld, where the Protectors helped capture the facilities of MandalMotors in the planet's capital of Keldabe, forcing the company to commit its resources to aid the CIS. Following this engagement, the Protectors would carry out covert missions for the Confederacy.[1] Around this time, and perhaps during one of these covert missions, Shysa had a run in with C-3PX, a formidable assassin droid. Following the encounter, the droid gave Shysa and the Mandalorians the inspiration to requisition a droid army for themselves.[7] Using the Separatists' factories, the Protectors created a group of 1000 BL-series Battle Legionnaire droids armed with AAP-11 blaster boxes and capable of piloting deadly Mandalorian battle harnesses.[1][7] With their new droid army, the Protectors charged into battle against the Republic, executing attacks on Null,[8] New Holstice,[9] and Zaadja.[2][10] Shysa and the Protectors would also lead retaliatory strikes on New Bornalex and Kamino[1][7] in the wake of the death of a major Separatist leader.[2]
            As the war waged to its climax, the Mandalorian Protectors were selected for a special mission. Darth Sidious, the secret leader of the CIS, ordered the Mandalorian government to send Shysa and the Protectors on a mission to the planet Norval II. The group's objective was to capture Senator Padmé Amidala, but after arriving they were ambushed by Republic forces as part of a great deception engineered by Republic Supreme Chancellor Palpatine—the public alter-ego of Darth Sidious.[1] The Mandalorians were almost entirely wiped out, including nearly all their Battle Legionnaire droids.[7] Of their entire force, only three Mandalorians escaped the slaughter: Shysa, Dala, and Spar.[1][3] Shysa and the others returned home to Mandalore where a shell-shocked and psychologically scarred Spar stepped down from his position of Mand'alor, though Shysa would make repeated attempts to persuade Spar to reclaim the title.[6] He believed that without a proper Mand'alor, the Mandalorians would look weak in the eyes of the galaxy at large. However, his attempts to sway Spar would be unsuccessful.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fenn_Shysa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFennShysa</string></dict>
        <key>Jell Spiel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.103.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jell Spiel was a Human male from Bespin who served the Bespin Wing Guard as a cloud car pilot during the Galactic Civil War. He co-piloted one of two Storm IV Twin-Pod cloud cars near Cloud City in 3 ABY when the Millennium Falcon arrived there. One Cloud Car fired warning shots at the freighter before escorting it to a landing platform. Spiel's experience as a pilot of cloud car prototypes proved very useful during the evacuation of Bespin.
            This character was most prominently seen as an action figure in Kenner's The Empire Strikes Back toy line, though the pilots can be briefly glimpsed inside the Cloud Cars in the film. Close up photos of the Cloud Car prop used in the film shows two different pilots inside the pods.[2][3] The action figure package photo appears to be one of those pilots.[4] His name and personal history was finally revealed in the Rogues Gallery feature of Star Wars Insider 148. The second pilot, distinguished by a mustache,[5] was the basis for a later action figure by Hasbro. He was later named Duncan Hikmat.
            The figures' full uniforms were based on concept art by Nilo Rodis-Jamero, which was later used to represent Rebel Alliance officer Kem Monnon in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jell_Spiel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJellSpiel</string></dict>
        <key>Hudu Shiv</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.104.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hudu Shiv was a Human male member of Death Watch during the Clone Wars. He was regarded as one of their best snipers. He was sent to work for Count Dooku in 21 BBY to ensure the assassination of Commissioner Langu Sommilor from the planet Kynachi before they reached Coruscant, and to further the plans of Dooku and his master using Jedi Padawan Nuru Kungurama. Shiv performed his assassination, but was unable to flee without being seen by the Jedi, and was forced to fake his own death to ensure Death Watch's anonymity.
            Hudu Shiv was a Human male Death Watch assassin. In 22 BBY,[2] Count Dooku contacted the Death Watch and requested a sniper, and Hudu Shiv was sent. Shiv arrived at Dooku's retreat on Kohlma, and after being tested with remotes to prove his prowess, he was sent on to Vaced with specific instructions to assassinate the Commissioner of Kynachi, Langu Sommilor.[1]
            Arriving on the planet Vaced, where Sommilor was going to meet with an escort, Shiv prepared an ambush outside of Vaced Spaceport, and was hidden under a camouflage net in a tree when Breaker, a member of the Galactic Republic unit Breakout Squad, was on patrol and stumbled upon Shiv's speeder bike Shiv knocked Breaker unconscious and tied him up, as he had been instructed to not allow anyone to know that a Mandalorian had been involved in the assassination.[1]
            When Sommilor arrived on Vaced, Shiv used poison darts to kill him and the two KynachTech Industries pilots who accompanied him. Shiv prepared to go, leaving behind the utility belt of Jedi Master Ring-Sol Ambase as Count Dooku had instructed, when Ambase's Padawan Nuru Kungurama approached him on a stolen swoop with a swoop gang in hot pursuit. Shiv had been instructed to leave Kungurama alive, and attempted to elude them, but knowing the swoops were faster than his speeder bike, tossed a thermal detonator, knowing Kungurama would be able to avoid it. Kungurama dodged the detonator, but the explosion took out the swoop gang. When Kungurama followed Shiv into the canyon called Shattered Rock, now accompanied by the sole survivor of the gang, Gizman, Shiv circled around to ambush them. Shiv shot Gizz and caused the swoop to crash.[1]
            Shiv checked to see if the young Jedi was alive, and found him not only alive but conscious. The two fought a brief duel before the Hasty Harpy, the starship Kungurama had been traveling on, arrived. Shiv used his jetpack to flee, and when the Hasty Harpy followed him, he used his rocket to attack the ship. He returned to his Pursuer-class enforcement ship and, after detaching the lifeboat, sent the ship by remote control to follow the Harpy, and let it be destroyed, fooling Breakout Squad into thinking he was dead. The confrontation, though, also resulted in the damaging of the Hasty Harpy. Then he took the lifeboat to a nearby space station to wait for a Death Watch ship to pick him up, hoping to someday confront Kungurama again.[1]
            Dooku commented on Shiv's skill as a Death Watch sniper. Shiv took many precautions but was proud of his abilities and wore a heavily armed set of Mandalorian armor. Shiv was capable of piloting a variety of vehicles and could use a jetpack.[1]
            Hudu Shiv appeared in Ryder Windham's 2011 book The Clone Wars: Secret Missions 3: Duel at Shattered Rock.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hudu_Shiv</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHuduShiv</string></dict>

            Following the end of the war, he led a group of Mandalorian and Duros bandits (including Reeza and Jarg) to Dantooine, where they terrorized and extorted the local settlers. However, his group of bandits was too small to pose a threat to the Jedi Enclave or any other well-organized defense. Future Mandalore Canderous Ordo was disgusted by him, his followers, and other Mandalorians like him, saying that they were taking scraps when they should be taking worlds.
            It was rumored he received support from the Sith; this would make sense as he killed Jedi and made the locals distrustful of their supposed protectors. As a Jedi hunter, Sherruk enjoyed eliminating Jedi and taking their lightsabers as trophies. He is known to have killed two Jedi; one with a red lightsaber and one with a blue lightsaber.
            In 3956 BBY, Sherruk and his companions were killed by a reformed Revan, though the former Sith Lord did not find it easy, as Sherruk proved a very skilled fighter.
            His name is spelled both Sherruk and Sheruk in the game. Sherruk is found in the southern end of the Grove.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sherruk</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSherruk</string></dict>

In 19 BBY, Shens came to Coruscant to graduate, attaining the rank of Ensign. He was a friend of Caul Gentis and Laurita Tohm, the latter being the valedictorian of their Academy.
            Shens, however, was also secretly a member of Headmaster Gentis's coup, a hero of the Clone Wars who sought to take over the Galactic Empire in order to stop the unending deaths of Imperial officers at the orders of the Emperor. Shens and Caul, at Gentis's orders, locked Tohm inside a prototype TIE Fighter, attempting to keep him away from the opening battles of their coup. Though the initial attacks succeeded in both wiping out seventy-two Imperial officers and gravely wounding Palpatine, Shens was one of the masked assailants who was counterattacked by Darth Vader. Vader threw a large piece of stone atop Shens and several others, crushing them beneath its weight. Tohm, who had escaped the fighter by engaging its ejection seat, happened upon the wounded Shens, who grabbed his ankle and begged for his help. Tohm was horrified to find that his friend—not to mention Gentis himself—were traitors to the Emperor. He asked Shens why he hadn't been involved, and Shens told him that due to his deformities and success, he stood out too much and would have been noticed. Shens then begged him to kill Vader, but Tohm told him that he should have asked him earlier and shot Shens in the head, killing him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shens</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascShens</string></dict>

Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Childsen was stationed onboard the Death Star battle station, where he worked in Detention Block AA-23. The Lieutenant was shot by the Jedi Luke Skywalker when he and the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca arrived in Block AA-23 to rescue Princess Leia Organa.
            The male human Shann Childsen[3] served in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire's army during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[2] During the war, he held the rank of lieutenant[4] and was station on board the Death Star, a battle station with the capability to destroy planets. Childsen worked on the station's fifth level in Detention Block AA-23, where prisoners including Princess Leia Organa were kept in cells.[1]
            Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, a group arrived on the Death Star hoping to rescue Organa. Two of the group, the Jedi Luke Skywalker and the smuggler Han Solo disguised themselves as stormtroopers and made their way to Block AA-23 with the Wookiee Chewbacca. As the trio arrived in a turbolift, Childsen questioned the troopers on what they were doing with the Wookiee. The two disguised rescuers attempted to fool Childsen, claiming that they were transferring Chewbacca from Cell Block 1138. Not having been informed of any transfers, Childsen signaled for two Imperial troopers with him to drawn their weapons and then attempted to check the Stormtroopers' claim. Solo and Skywalker, realizing their bluff had failed, opened fire on the Imperials and in the ensuing fight the Jedi shot and killed Childsen. The rescuers then managed to successfully free Organa and escape the Death Star.[1]
            Childsen was a fair-skinned human with brown hair and blue eyes. He referred to the Wookiee Chewbacca as a "thing" upon seeing the non-human.[1]
            Childsen wore a black Imperial uniform including a cap and carried a DH-17 blaster pistol.[1]

        <key>Theron Shan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.109.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Theron Shan was a Human male of the Shan family, the secret son of Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan and Supreme Commander Jace Malcom of Republic Military. Conceived after his parents fought together in the Battle of Alderaan, Theron's mother gave him to be raised by her former Jedi Master Ngani Zho. Theron was trained as a Jedi in his childhood, but was forced to leave the Jedi Order after Zho realized that the boy was not Force-sensitive. Theron eventually joined the Republic Strategic Information Service and became one of its top field agents. Late in the Cold War Theron and a Twi'lek criminal Teff'ith joined Ngani Zho to investigate the Vesla system, where Darth Mekhis was using the Sun Razer to construct superweapons. Captured by Imperials, Theron was able to break free and kill Mekhis, though his old Master died biding time for him and Teff'ith to escape. After the Battle of Ilum Theron was assigned to destroy the Ascendant Spear, a superweapon commanded by Mekhis' successor Darth Karrid, working alongside Jedi Master Gnost-Dural and learning that Supreme Commander Malcom was his father. Theron and Gnost-Dural infiltrated the Ascendant Spear and sabotaged it during the Battle of Duro, killing Darth Karrid and earning a Cross of Glory. For killing both her predecessors, the Dark Councillor Darth Acina dubbed the unknown Republic asset Technoplague.
            Later in the Galactic War Theron assisted Republic Colonel Rian Darok in planning the Korriban Incursion. The Empire retaliated with an Assault on Tython, and suspecting that the attacks were related, Theron spied on Darok and found him to be in league with the Sith Lord Darth Arkous. On Manaan Theron met Arkous' advisor Lana Beniko, who revealed that Darok and Arkous were both members of the Order of Revan. Teaming with the Wookiee smuggler Jakarro, they tracked the conspirators to Rakata Prime, causing their deaths and learning that the Order was led by Revan himself, Theron's distant ancestor. Disavowed by the SIS, Theron went into hiding along with Lana and Jakarro, and tracked down Revan and his allies to Rishi, where they exposed the conspiracy to Satele Shan and Darth Marr. To stop Revan from resurrecting the Sith Emperor, the Grand Master and the Dark Councillor joined forces and traveled to Yavin 4, where Theron and his mother stood against Revan alongside Darth Marr, Lana Beniko, Jakarro and Shae Vizla. Though Revan was defeated, the Emperor returned to life, while Theron was reinstated in the SIS with a promotion. He sent the Jedi of the Sixth Line to investigate violence on Ziost, where they fell under Emperor Vitiate's thrall. Theron worked with Beniko to stop Vitiate and was able to shock a large number of his pawns unconscious and remove Sixth Line Master Surro from the planet's surface before Vitiate performed the ritual that wiped out all life on the planet.
            Later that year, the galaxy was invaded by the Eternal Empire of Zakuul, which overwhelmed both the Republic and the Sith Empire. Angered by policies of Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh, Theron quit the SIS and five years later joined the Alliance formed by Beniko that opposed Zakuul's Emperor Arcann. From the Alliance base on Odessen Theron worked to destroy Zakuulan Star Fortresses and accompanied the Alliance Commander to Zakuul to recruit the anarchist known as "Firebrand" and Republic Special Forces Havoc Squad. Theron participated in the plunder of the Gilded Star and arranged for Mandalorians led by Mandalore the Avenger to assist the Alliance with the Raid on Darvannis. He was part of the attempt to take over the Eternal Fleet, during which SCORPIO betrayed the Alliance and claimed the Eternal Throne for herself. Theron manned the Gravestone omnicannon in the following battle of Odessen, in which Emepero Arcann was defeated. Arcann's sister Vaylin allied with SCORPIO and became the new Eternal Empress, and Theron fought her army during the Invasion of Voss. He joined Lana and the Commander on a diplomatic visit to Sith Empress Acina on Dromund Kaas and led Alliance reinforcements to reclaim the Gravestone from Vaylin and her forces. When Alliance leadership got stranded on Iokath, Theron's implants proved crucial for them in obtaining the means of escaping. He joined the Commander in infiltrating the Grand Festival of Empress Vaylin and piloted the shuttle during a mission to Nathema. When Vaylin launched an assault on Odessen, Theron fought from behind the enemy lines, after which he traveled with the Alliance forces to Zakuul, where Commander claimed the Eternal Throne that controlled the Eternal Fleet.
            Learning about the secretive Order of Zildrog, Theron faked his defection to the Order by luring the Commander into a trap during the War on Iokath and staged a betrayal of Lana and the Commander during a mission to Umbara. Stalling the Order with false data to buy the Alliance time, Theron helped retrieve Vitiate's holomap from the Chiss House Inrokini on Copero, which led the Order to locate the ancient machine god Zildrog on Nathema. Theron leaked those coordinates to the Alliance, revealing his true allegiance and rejoined Lana and the Commander to stop the Order's leader Vinn Atrius from awakening Zildrog.

        <key>Shale</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.110.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shale was a Human male who was serving as a captain in the Imperial Navy around the time when the Old Republic was reorganized into the first Galactic Empire. Aside from his friendship with Admiral Garoche Tarkin, he had also earned the trust and confidence of his friend's father, then-Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. During a mission to locate the missing Admiral Tarkin, Shale showed himself to be both a capable officer and an effective soldier on the battlefield, albeit a ruthless one as well.
            After enlisting into military service, Shale trained at an Academy to become an officer. During his training, he met a fellow cadet named Garoche Tarkin, the son of Wilhuff Tarkin. Although the two competed against one other as rivals, they also respected each other as friends. Shale's friendship with the young Tarkin not only gave him an insight into his friend's mind, but also acquainted him with Garoche's influential father. By the time he had reached the rank of captain in the Imperial Navy, Shale had earned the respect and trust of the elder Tarkin, by then a Moff at the time.[2]
            Not long after the creation of the Galactic Empire, Admiral Tarkin had disappeared along with his Imperial I-class Star Destroyer during a mission to hunt down insurgents in the Ghost Nebula. This unexpected setback caused Moff Tarkin to request the aid of Emperor Palpatine himself. When the Emperor summoned his Sith apprentice Darth Vader to the throne room, Moff Tarkin was present with Captain Shale at his side. Tarkin was displeased that the Emperor had chosen Vader to find Garoche, given the Sith Lord's previous record of losing sight of his mission objectives when ever the opportunity to hunt Jedi fugitives presented itself. Not only did Tarkin openly voice his lack of confidence in Vader, he also presented his contingency plan in the form of Captain Shale, who was to assist Vader in the search for Garoche and to ensure that the mission would still succeed in the event that Vader strayed away from the core of his mission once more.[2]
            Although Shale assured the Sith Lord that he would be most useful in finding Admiral Tarkin, Vader merely saw him as a nuisance and blatantly insisted that he did not need a "shadow" to follow him and watch his every move. But the Emperor made it quite clear that Captain Shale would be part of the mission, thus forcing Vader to back down on the matter. Thus, Shale disembarked on his new assignment to find his lost friend with Vader and two battalions of the 501st Legion.[2]
            After reaching the Atoa system in the Ghost Nebula, the last known location of Admiral Tarkin before his disappearance, Vader and his Imperial force began their search on the planet Atoa. Arriving on the planet's surface in the same gunship as Darth Vader and a contingent of 501st stormtroopers, Shale and the Imperials located a nearby inhabited city protected by armed soldiers.[2]
            While Darth Vader wasted no time at all in ordering his stormtroopers to assault the city and slay many of its inhabitants, Captain Shale used the Sith Lord's distraction to covertly infiltrate the city with a squad of dark-armored stormtroopers. When a lone enemy soldier managed to ambush Vader and his troopers by shooting at them from high ground, Shale was able to knock her out with a single deft attack from behind after he and his men entered the city without being detected. Although Shale somewhat egotistically tried to claim credit for his action, Vader ignored the officer and pressed deeper into the city with Shale and the 501st in tow.[2]
            Discovering that the last of the city's protectors were holed up in a tower guarded by heavy artillery and snipers, Commander Voca suggested that an AT-TE Walker could destroy the tower without any risk to the Imperials. But Vader, having little concern for Imperial lives or resources, was only interested in capturing the city's leaders alive for interrogation and thus settled on the direct approach of storming the tower head on. Captain Shale, on the other hand, insisted that Vader's objectives could be completed without suffering more casualties than was necessary. To that end, Shale requested that the Dark Lord create a distraction while he and his stormtroopers infiltrated the tower. After a moment's consideration, Vader agreed.[2]
            To ensure that Shale's plan succeeded, Vader stepped out from hiding and presented himself in open view to the snipers, much to the surprise of his stormtroopers. But before the snipers could target Vader, the Dark Lord used the Force to create a massive snow storm, hurling it in the direction of the tower and thus blinding the snipers. With the distraction working perfectly, Captain Shale and his men quickly climbed to the top of the tower and easily dispatched the snipers, but only wounded them as per Vader's instructions to take the tower's occupants alive for questioning.[2]
            In the aftermath of the battle, Vader had Commander Voca and the 501st stormtroopers transport the remaining enemy soldiers to the bank of a river just outside the city. After a short and unsuccessful interrogation, Captain Shale stood by and nonchalantly watched as Vader ordered Voca to burn the city and drown the prisoners. At that moment, however, a boat loaded with white-robed figures drifted towards the Imperials. Before either Shale or Voca could open fire, Vader commanded them to stand down. A female priestess disembarked from the boat and greeted Vader and his men as "servants of the Empire". Identifying herself as High Priestess Saro of Atoa, she promised to help the Imperials in finding whatever they were looking for.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shale</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascShale</string></dict>
        <key>Shan  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.111.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shan was a male human who served as a Captain in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire. He commanded one of three Star Destroyers sent to the recover the Imperialis—personal pleasure corvette of Galactic Emperor Palpatine—when it was stolen in the Castell system. After Commodore Idel, commander of one of the other Star Destroyers, offered one million credits to whoever captured the corvette, Shan tried to use his vessel's tractor beam to secure it. Captain Conro of the third Star Destroyer had the same idea, and the two vessels' beams locked onto each other causing the ships to collide and allowing the Imperialis to escape.
            The male human Shan served the Galactic Empire as Captain of one of the Imperial Navy's Imperial-class Star Destroyers. His vessel and two other Star Destroyers under the commands of Captain Conro and Commodore Idel respectively, were sent to the Castell system in order to prevent the escape of Galactic Emperor Palpatine's personal pleasure yacht Imperialis, which had been stolen from Imperial Orbital Shipyard CC-24 by the smuggler Lando Calrissian and his team of thieves. Upon entering the star system, Idel informed the two captains of their mission via hologram, and then destroyed Orbital Shipyard CC-24 to make an example of those who lost the Emperor's property. The Commodore then ordered Shan and Conro to stand by while he dealt with Calrissian and his companions, releasing a pair of gravity mines designed to stick to the hull of the Imperialis and prevent it from jumping out of the system.[1]
            The yacht's defense system destroyed the two mines before they could attach to it, prompting Idel to offer a million credits to the man that captured the Imperialis. Eager to claim the reward, Shan activated his Star Destroyer's tractor beam in order to pull in the yacht. The beam successfully locked onto the Imperialis, but Calrissian had piloted the vessel to lie directly between Shan and Conro's Star Destroyers. Conro had also activated his tractor beam to capture Calrissian, and the two Star Destroyer's tractor beams locked onto each other. Realizing what had happened, Shan screamed for his vessel to disengage but was too late, and the two Star Destroyers crashed into one another as the Imperialis escaped.[1]
            Shan was a fair-skinned human with brown hair. He considered the use of three Star Destroyers to capture a single yacht overkill, but was happy to take up the challenge once Idel put one million credits on offer. When he caught the Imperialis, Shan was pleased with his crew and ordered that they send commiserations to Conro.[1]
            Shan first appeared in the second issue of the Star Wars: Lando comic book mini-series. The comic was published in 2015 and was written by Charles Soule with illustrations by Alex Maleev.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shan_(Captain)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascShan</string></dict>
        <key>Vaner Shan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.112.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vaner Shan was the son of Revan and Bastila Shan, two famous Jedi Knights and heroes of the Jedi Civil War that was fought between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Born around 3954 BBY, Vaner greatly resembled his father at the time of the Jedi Civil War, having Revan's dark brown eyes, fair skin and shoulder length dark brown hair. The Human male's name was an anagram of his father's, but unlike both his parents, Vaner was not sensitive to the Force and therefore never joined the Jedi Order.
            Vaner became a politician instead, developing into a major leader in the time of rebuilding following the Jedi Civil War, and he was a candidate to run for Supreme Chancellor in 3900 BBY. By that year, he had married a woman named Emess and had two children named Reesa and Bress Shan. In 3900 BBY, Vaner and his family visited his mother on the anniversary of her marriage to Revan, who had disappeared before Vaner had been born.[1]
            Vaner's situation of not being born Force-sensitive despite being the son of a powerful Force-sensitive was repeated generations later with his descendant, Theron Shan.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vaner_Shan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVanerShan</string></dict>
        <key>Shaardan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.113.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shaardan was a male Human who was a prospective student of the Sith Academy on Korriban during the Jedi Civil War. In 3956 BBY, he would go into the local colony of Dreshdae and intimidate and embarrass the locals.
            When Revan arrived at Dreshdae he found Shaardan getting tired of Prospective Sith failing to get his moral questions correct. He then asked Revan what punishment should he give to the "hopefuls." Revan convinced Shaardan to let them go. Shaardan, hoping to gain favor with Master Uthar Wynn, waited for another student to wander into the tomb of Ajunta Pall and retrieve his sword. Unfortunately for him, the student who recovered it was Revan. Shaardan confronted Revan near the entrance of Pall's tomb. He had hoped to intimidate Revan into giving him the sword. However, Revan refused and an angered Shaardan attacked Revan, but was slain. Revan ended up being the one to give the sword to Master Wynn for the prestige.[1]
            When it comes to dealing with Shaardan's "hopefuls", there are number of options.
            Telling Shaardan to let them go is the light side option;
            The player could also tell Shaardan to kill the hopefuls, which he gladly does with Force lightning.
            Oddly enough, should the player demand to be left out of this, Shaardan lets the hopefuls go but the player still gets dark side points, as it involves leaving the hopefuls to Shaardan's mercy.
            As an alternative, Revan could give Shaardan a fake sword. Shaardan would then take it (as he had no idea what it really looked like). With the false sword, Shaardan returned to Uthar Wynn only to be strangled for his failure to recognize Revan's deceit. Another possibility is for Revan to give Shaardan the sword. It should be noted that Shaardan fights Revan with a vibro double-blade rather than a lightsaber even though he is seen carrying a lightsaber at all other times.
            Revan doesn't even have to recover Ajunta Pall's blade at all to impress Uthar enough to proceed to Naga Sadow's Tomb, so Revan may not encounter Shaardan again after their encounter as Revan arrives on the planet. So Shaardan could remain in the Academy from then on, with the Academy run under Yuthura Ban, or to be killed as Revan proceeds to take down all remaining Sith insurgents left inside the academy.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shaardan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascShaardan</string></dict>

            It was said Charle Organa epitomized the virtues his house was known for. He was a fierce opponent of the reconstituted Sith Empire, which had the Organa family treated brutally during the Sith’s short-lived invasion of Alderaan. When Alderaan’s civil war began, Charle Organa had privately trained a talented and honorable battalion, and he turned to the Republic for advice and assistance during the crisis.
            As the war pressed only, Organa enlisted the aid of a Republic strike team to stop Jharkus Thul, aka the Wolf Baron, from seizing the Spears of Organa. Though the strike team succeeded in securing the spears, Thul contacted Organa via hologram to gloat that he had captured many civilians during the battle and suggested they parley. Upon meeting, Thul demanded a trade. Organa assumed the Wolf Baron wanted him, but Thul was interested in taking the strike team off the board, believing it would uneven the odds of the next battle. The strike team agreed for the hostages' sake. But after the exchange was made, the freed hostages arrived to rescue their saviours. The strike team soon lead an assault on the Thul war camps. Organa reunited with his house's champions and praised them for the victory. He then revealed that the Wolf Baron was captured during the battle and left his fate in the team's hands. The team showed mercy towards Thul, a decision that Organa commended.
            Even though they had deprived House Thul a general, one who would be easily replaced, House Organa would have to turn their attention to House Ulgo, whose leader Bouris Ulgo seized the throne by force. Ulgo was somehow controlling Killiks to attack Organa forces and the strike team was sent to investigate. The strike team later reported to Organa that Ulgo was performing horrific experiments on Killiks and that his own science commander, Keikana Herot, was seeking to replicate their experiments. Organa responded by transferring Herot to a different posting.
            Charle Organa was created for the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Charle_Remmot_Organa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCharleRemmotOrgana</string></dict>
        <key>Bruck Chun</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.117.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bruck Chun was a twelve-year old male Human Jedi Initiate from Telos IV enrolled in the academy at the Jedi Temple in the final decades of the Galactic Republic.
            A Force-sensitive Human male with ice-blue eyes and white hair, Bruck Chun, the brother of Kad Chun, was born to Vox Chun of Telos IV in 57 BBY.[3] Given to the Jedi Order for training in the ways of the Force, Initiate Chun was enrolled in the academy at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. Befriending fellow Initiate Aalto, Chun and his friend often taunted their peer Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom they called "Oafy-Wan" after Kenobi had lost his balance on one occasion, colliding with Chun.[2] He also attempted to impress the attractive Initiate, Siri Tachi, many times, but to no avail; he eventually moved on.[1]
            Around 45 BBY and 44 BBY, Chun had secretly learned from Dark Jedi Xanatos, a business partner of Chun's father and fellow Telosian,[1][3] that his father Vox was the Treasurer of Telos.[1][4] He bragged about it at one time to Siri Tachi, something the girl would later bring up during a future investigation.[1]
            As both Chun and Kenobi reached their final years at the academy, both vied for the attention of a Jedi Master who would select them as a Padawan. During an unsupervised sparring session, Chun deliberately started to antagonize Kenobi and both students walked away with minor bruises. Chun, in an attempt to get Kenobi in trouble with academy instructors, went to the Halls of Healing to report an attack by Kenobi and receive treatment for his wounds. Instead of disciplining Kenobi as Chun had hoped, Grand Master Yoda set up a duel between the two Initiates to demonstrate their skills for visiting Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Completing the duel fairly, Master Jinn did not select either of the Initiates, much to Chun's chagrin. By this time, Chun was no longer using one of the Temple's training lightsabers; instead, he wielded a red-bladed weapon available to senior Initiates.[2]
            In the following months, Kenobi had been selected by Master Jinn after all, but the Master-apprentice bond was broken after the disastrous mission to Melida/Daan. There, Padawan Kenobi had forsworn his oath to the Order and joined a militant group called the Young and fought in the Melida/Daan Civil War. Returning to the Temple without his Padawan, Master Jinn could not be bothered by Initiate Chun's attempts to get him to accept him as his next student.[5]
            Crestfallen with Master Jinn's constant refusal to take him on as an apprentice, Chun was easy prey to the temptations offered by Xanatos. Corrupted by Xanatos, Chun assisted the Dark Jedi as Xanatos infiltrated the Temple and began wreaking havoc. A pawn of the manipulative former Jedi,[1] Chun stole many artifacts from within the Temple, including the precious Healing Crystals of Fire. He was secretly caught in the act by Jinn and Master Tahl while he was covering up some of the stolen items from the Temple's Lake Level. Jinn tried to follow him, but Tahl's navigation droid 2JTJ accidentally alerted Chun of the Jedi's presence. He was forced to disappear after that.[5] Keeping close to the masters, Chun transmitted recordings of conversations with the Jedi via a transmitter installed secretly in his lightsaber hilt.[1]
            When Xanatos had finally been found out, he kidnapped Initiate Bant Eerin and chained her underwater in the Room of a Thousand Fountains. While Master Jinn attempted to halt Xanatos stealing the Temple's supply of valuable vertex, the Dark Jedi ordered Chun to kill Initiate Eerin immediately. Kenobi chased Chun to the Room of a Thousand Fountains and engaged his opponent in a lightsaber duel. They made their way up the slippery slope of the chamber's central waterfall. As Kenobi struggled to break away from Chun in order to rescue Initiate Eerin, who was chained to the bottom of the room's lake, Chun lost his footing and toppled over the edge of the waterfall. Chun tried his best to hold on, but couldn't hold on for along, though Kenobi apologized for everything and attempted to save his life, which surprised Chun. Chun ignored him, and preferred to die for everything he had done, and saying that he wasn't truly a strong apprentice to begin with. Kenobi didn't want him to die and tried to reach him, but it was far too late for the young Initiate. Chun couldn't hold on and plummeted to the rocks below, breaking his neck.[1]
            Following his death, Chun's father initiated an investigation into his son's death. Employing Senator Sano Sauro as prosecutor, Initiate Kenobi was implicated in the death of his peer. Appearing before the Senate's Inquiry committee, Kenobi was rescued from prosecution by Master Jinn. Entering Chun's recovered lightsaber into evidence, Jinn played the recording of Chun's final words for the committee: the evidence proved Kenobi innocent, although it would be many years before Chun's brother, Kad would forgive Kenobi and before Kenobi could forgive himself.[3]
            Bruck Chun was described by Obi-Wan Kenobi as cruel and manipulative. Even Yoda and Mace Windu could see Chun's deceptive nature.[2] He also valued his dignity greatly, and was known to hold grudges. This was especially evident when Obi-Wan tripped him in the halls of the Jedi Temple accidentally, and he soon found an enemy in the boy. Chun was also impatient and quick to anger. Yoda appeared to have helped him improve on his faults.[5] Yet he was very eager to become Qui-Gon Jinn's Padawan, just as Kenobi was.[2][5] Siri Tachi also depicted him as a showoff and a "bore."[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bruck_Chun</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBruckChun</string></dict>

            Before the battle of Endor erupted in the year 4 ABY, Hewex was stationed inside the deflector shield bunker during the construction of the second Death Star. Together with a fleet division, Hewex would guard the complex with the generator at all costs. In addition to this task, Hewex also served as a liaison officer between the bunker's command staff and the Imperial technicians.
            His efforts were unsuccessful. When the Rebel Alliance learned of the plans of the Empire, a rebel strike team led by Han Solo managed to land on Endor with the help of a hijacked Imperial Space Shuttle, the Tydirium. The Alliance envisaged a ground force on Endor destroying the generator of the SLD-26 Shield to allow the rebel fleet in orbit to attack the the battle station. Together with the local Ewoks, the rebels were able to invade the control bunker, destroy the generator, and subsequently destroy the Death Star.

        <key>Darth Chratis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.125.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Chratis was a male Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire who served the Imperial mission during the Cold War.
            Darth Chratis was preceded by his reputation as a brutal taskmaster to Sith apprentices, and his training methods were looked upon with scorn by members of the Sith Emperor's Dark Council. Nevertheless, he was allowed to continue training students, and by 3667 BBY, Chratis had taken a young Human girl named Eldon Ax as his latest protégé.
            In 3643 BBY, Darth Chratis and his apprentice were granted permission to pursue the Imperial fugitive Lema Xandret, who happened to also be the biological mother of Ax. With half of an Imperial division under his command, Darth Chratis waited above the planet Krant as his apprentice, while on a mission to Hutta, obtained information leading to Xandret's redoubt on the hidden world of Sebaddon.
            When Ax returned with her findings, Darth Chratis led his contingent to Sebaddon with intentions of subjugating the world in the name of the Emperor. Upon their arrival, however, the Sith bore witness to the full scope of Xandret's megalomania; her Fastbreeder combat droids were embroiled in combat with a flotilla of Republic starships under the command of Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan. Chratis' mission saw him enter into an alliance with Shan, but he was ultimately killed by his apprentice during the subsequent battle for Sebaddon.
            Darth Chratis was a man with blood-red eyes that were set in a deeply wrinkled face. His knife-thin lips parted to reveal a nearly transparent tongue and needle-sharp teeth, and a decrepit voice. Chratis had hands with withered talons for nails, and his feet made the sound of crushed leaves when he walked. Darth Chratis was of the contention that his apprentices lived to serve the Emperor through him, and strove to impart that belief to them. Chratis felt that the Jedi were limited in their potential because they refused to embrace the Force in its entirety; he believed that the teachings of Jedi Masters were inherently flawed because they taught repression of oneself, as opposed to the acceptance and exploitation of one's emotions in the pursuit of greater power. To Chratis, strength was only born from conflict, and conflict was a necessity so long as enemies existed. The threat of force was often more than enough to compel others into Chratis's service.
            Darth Chratis believed in the virtues of meditation and did so for at least an hour a day. The isolation Chratis experienced while sealed within his meditation sarcophagus forced the Sith Lord to rely solely on his own power for sustenance. Darth Chratis was able to summon devastating blasts of Force lightning, which he used to both destroy numerous hex droids and incapacitate the enraged Shigar Konshi. Lord Chratis supported himself by a long staff with a pointed end. However, when the need arose, Chratis' staff collapsed to half length and revealed his lightsaber concealed within, being wielded as a long-handled lightsaber. Its elongated hilt afforded the Sith Lord a significant increase in the reach of his blade. Darth Chratis could read minds, communicate telepathically, and use Force lightning.
            Darth Chratis was first introduced in The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance, a novel based on the MMORPG of the same name written by author Sean Williams.
            Among the eight main characters, all of whom represent player classes from "Star Wars: The Old Republic", Darth Chratis represented the Sith Inquisitor class, an Imperial class that relies mainly on ranged Force powers, rather than physical attack.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Chratis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthChratis</string></dict>
        <key>Valin Horn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.126.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Valin Horn was a male Human Jedi Knight, the son of Corran Horn and Mirax Terrik Horn, and the older brother of Jysella Horn. In 43 ABY he became one of the first Jedi to become infected with Force psychosis, resulting in his encasement in carbonite.
            Horn, named for his paternal grandfather Valin Halcyon, was born about four years after Grand Admiral Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic. He was musically inclined and could often be found playing his chordokeylo. A Force-sensitive, he eventually attended Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 to train as a Jedi Knight.
            Horn developed skills similar to those of Jacen Solo, particularly his affinity with animals. Around the age of eleven, he found he could communicate with animals through the Force. However, like his father and grandfather before him, he was weak in the art of telekinesis. In one instance, since Valin could not lift a stone using telekinesis, he instead used the Force to persuade small insects called garnants to move a stone for him by convincing them it was food. His father saw the stone move and thought Valin had used telekinesis until the younger Horn explained his method. He brought food for the garnants and left it for them before leaving, keeping his promise of food for them.
            During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Horn was trapped on Yavin 4 with the other Praxeum students when the Peace Brigade blockaded the system. Fortunately, Horn, Sannah and Kam Solusar managed to survive long enough to escape during Anakin Solo's risky mission to save the trapped Jedi.[3] Horn then spent some time training with the remaining Jedi initiates onboard his maternal grandfather Booster Terrik's ship Errant Venture.[4]
            After the Battle of Coruscant, he and the other Jedi children were sent to the Maw for safety for the remainder of the war.[5]  At the end of the conflict, Horn traveled to Zonama Sekot for Grand Master Skywalker's meeting with the surviving Jedi.[6]
            By the time of the Second Galactic Civil War, Horn was performing missions for the Jedi Order, and from his age he would be presumed to have reached the rank of Jedi Knight. As conflict developed against his ancestral homeworld Corellia, Grand Master Luke Skywalker ensured that his duties kept him well away from anywhere that his loyalties might be tested.
            During a mission in the underlevels of Coruscant, accompanied by Jedi Master Kyle Katarn, fellow Jedi Knights Thann Mithric and Kolir Hu'lya, and Jedi apprentice Seha Dorvald, Horn and the group came into confrontation with Jacen Solo. During the ensuing battle, Katarn was severely wounded after being stabbed in the chest by Solo, forcing Horn and Dorvald to remove him from the fight which culminated in the death of Mithric.
            Horn later participated in the operation to destroy Centerpoint Station, disguising himself as a Galactic Alliance Guard trooper alongside fellow Jedi, including Kyp Durron and Jaden Korr.
            In 43.5 ABY, Valin Horn was suddenly possessed with an enigmatic madness that caused him to believe that everyone he knew had been replaced by impostors. His psychosis making him believe they were impostors, he attacked his own parents, but was captured by them and taken to the Jedi Temple to be evaluated. He broke free, however, and became a fugitive of the Galactic Alliance, making Chief of State Natasi Daala even more distrustful towards the Jedi. After a long manhunt, he was caught by Luke Skywalker and placed in the Mon Mothma Memorial Medical Center, and later moved back to the Asylum Block.[7]
            Eventually, Daala released a warrant for Horn, and he was arrested by Galactic Alliance Security forces under Captain Oric Harfard, and put on trial. He was found incapable of standing trial, but too dangerous to be kept in a conventional prison, so he was encased in carbonite and placed in the Armand Isard Correctional Facility. A rescue attempt to free Horn was made by rogue Jedi Seff Hellin, who was suffering from the same disease, believing that Horn was the only one he knew that wasn't replaced by an imposter. It was unsuccessful, however, and resulted in Hellin's capture by Darkmeld, a covert organization formed by Jedi Knight Jaina Solo to counter Daala's efforts to undermine the Jedi Order.[7]
            At some point following the failed rescue attempt, Valin was transferred, along with his sister to the Palem Graser Office Tower[8], a secret GAS safehouse under the command of Colonel Wruq Retk and operating under the guise of Galactic Alliance Storage. The Jedi Order obtained a writ granting them visitation rights to the siblings, along with an incarceration order providing their location. After a brief attempt to turn away the visitation group, which included Corran and Mirax Horn, the GAS officers directed the Jedi to the siblings' location. The Jedi, and the many HoloNet Reporters that had rushed in as well, were abhorred to learn that Valin and Jysella were being hung as decoration in the executive offices. When Colonel Retk entered the room, he engaged in a short conversation with Mirax Horn before she knocked the Yaka unconscious. The entire incident was an embarrassment to the GA Government, with Daala promising to ensure that the carbonite frozen siblings would be treated with dignity.[9] After being freed from his carbonite prison, Valin and his sister were still inflicted with the Force psychosis. He was able to conceal his condition, being more in control of his emotions and suspicions than he was previously.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Valin_Horn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascValinHorn</string></dict>
        <key>Corran Horn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.127.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Corran Horn was a Force-sensitive Human male Corellian pilot who served as a Corellian Security Force investigator, a Rogue Squadron ace and New Republic hero, and later a Jedi Master of the New Jedi Order. Born to Nyche and Valin "Hal" Horn on Corellia, Horn lived his early life unaware that his grandfather was Nejaa Halcyon, a Jedi Master. He followed his father and adoptive grandfather into the Corellian Security Force, where he excelled. However, he came into conflict with his Imperial Intelligence liaison officer, Kirtan Loor, and eventually fled Corellia after the Battle of Endor in order to evade execution. Horn spent a year lying low on Garqi before saving several locals from the Empire and making the decision to join the New Republic.
            A highly skilled pilot, Horn joined Rogue Squadron in 6 ABY and became a flight leader. He participated in the captures of Borleias and Coruscant, taking the shields of the latter down and being captured by the Empire in the process. He was incarcerated in the infamous Lusankya prison, where he resisted Ysanne Isard's brainwashing and became the first individual ever to directly escape the prison. On his return, he was hailed as a hero, but on learning that the New Republic would not allow the targeting of Isard for political reasons, he led Rogue Squadron in resigning and waging a guerrilla war against Isard's regime on Thyferra. During the course of that campaign, the Bacta War, Horn was married to Mirax Terrik, the love of his life and the daughter of his father's old rival, Booster Terrik. Horn rejoined the New Republic and continued his career in Rogue Squadron, helping defeat Zsinj and Thrawn and free the Lusankya prisoners.
            When his wife was kidnapped in 11 ABY, Horn realized he had to tap his Jedi talents to save her, having learned of his family's secret past from Luke Skywalker's investigations several years earlier. He trained at Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum before rescuing Mirax, defeating the Invid pirate gang in the process. Horn balanced his careers as a pilot and Jedi until 19 ABY, when he resigned from the squadron with the rank of colonel after peace was achieved with the Imperial Remnant. Horn served as a Jedi instructor, training his two children, Valin and Jysella, before the Yuuzhan Vong War broke out. Horn served a vital role in the war, defeating Shedao Shai, the killer of Horn's close friend Elegos A'Kla, in a duel to save Ithor; the failure of the Yuuzhan Vong to live up to the terms of the duel shamed Horn and caused him to briefly take a leave of absence from the Jedi. He returned to full service after the Battle of Coruscant, and was crucial to the resolution of the war, helping unlock the mystery of Zonama Sekot.
            After the war, Horn was elevated to the rank of Jedi Master and became one of the leading Jedi on the Masters' Council. He argued for strong relations with the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, and during the Dark Nest Crisis in 36 ABY, he was temporarily put in charge of the Jedi Order. When events on Corellia erupted into a war in 40 ABY, Horn helped steer the Jedi through the crisis as a member of the Jedi Council, even when the Jedi were declared enemies of the state, and saw the Jedi to victory over Darth Caedus, Dark Lord of the Sith. In 43 ABY, when Jedi began succumbing to a strange Force madness, Horn's family was stricken with tragedy when his son and daughter both contracted the psychosis and were captured and imprisoned in carbonite by the Galactic Alliance.
            Corran Horn was born in 18 BBY, the son of Valin Horn, known widely as Hal, and Nyche Horn.[2][12] Valin Horn was actually the biological son of Nejaa Halcyon, a Jedi Master, but when Halcyon was killed, Valin was adopted by Rostek Horn, a Corellian Security Force police officer who was Halcyon's best friend. Rostek married Halcyon's wife Scerra as well and, as the Great Jedi Purge began, hid all evidence of Valin Horn, who now went by Hal, as he was a Force-sensitive. Corran Horn himself was raised in Coronet City, unaware of any of this history or his own Force-sensitivity.[13][14]
            As a child, Horn observed his father in some minor meditative exercises and attempted to imitate him. The elder Horn taught him these techniques, telling Horn they were part of a secret game and he must not reveal them to anyone; they were, in fact, Jedi exercises.[8] As he grew, his father and grandfather encouraged him to always follow his hunches and to heed any internal sense of discomfort with a situation, knowing that they were manifestations of his Force abilities.[1][15]
            Horn entered the Corellian Security Force Academy immediately upon graduating secondary school, where he excelled, setting new records—many of them by beating his father's. He was in the Academy when he heard of the destruction of the Death Star and the warrant placed on Han Solo for his part in it. Horn was left feeling that the smuggler Solo was a blot on Corellia's honor, causing the world to be overly associated with smuggling and lawlessness.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Corran_Horn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCorranHorn</string></dict>

He served Senator Padmé Amidala as an airspeeder driver on Coruscant during the Clone Wars.
            Around 32 BBY, Tinmar was active on Naboo during the Trade Federation's invasion. He was present with the group where Queen Padmé Amidala asked Boss Nass to help in their conflict against the Trade Federation.
            In 21 BBY, he transported Amidala to the apartment of Senator Christo, with senator Onaconda Farr not far behind. while he was waiting for her outside, the bounty hunter Robonino distracted him with the motor noise from his speeder bike, and drove away. Just a split-second later he was attacked by the bounty hunter Chata Hyoki and somehow incapacitated.
            Later in the war, he relocated back to Naboo and became one of Queen Neeyutnee's guards. He accompanied the queen to greet Senator Amidala when she arrived on her homeworld at the beginning of the skirmish between the Naboo and an alliance between the Gungans and Separatists. He also accompanied the queen during a prisoner exchange, releasing General Grievous back to the Confederacy who in turn released Anakin Skywalker.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hogan_Tinmar/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHoganTinmar</string></dict>
        <key>Hiram Drayson</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.129.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hiram Drayson was a Human male from Chandrila, known as a military commander and intelligence administrator.
            Drayson attended an offworld military academy, but returned home with his education incomplete when his father became ill. He took over his father's shipping business; under his leadership, it became the most successful such business in the Chandrila system. Because of this and his partial Academy education, the Chandrilan government made him the head admiral of the Chandrila Defense Fleet. He reorganized it to run more efficiently, cutting down piracy and smuggling dramatically. It was in his capacity as fleet commander that he came to know Senator Mon Mothma.[1] During the Clone Wars, Drayson was replaced as fleet head by Palpatine-appointed Kohl Seerdon after the passage of Emergency Amendment 121b. At some point in his career, he gained extensive experience serving aboard Star Destroyers, including a professional knowledge of their tractor beam systems.
            When Chandrila was brought to heel under the Imperial Starfleet, Drayson was contacted by Mon Mothma, who offered Drayson a role in the military leadership of the new Rebel Alliance as the commanding officer of the Alliance flagship. He accepted.[1]
            As the Alliance transitioned into the New Republic, Drayson was made an admiral and placed in command first of the fleet attached to the New Republic Provisional Council,[1] and then of the Coruscant defense fleet. He was tasked with the retrieval of the Katana fleet during the Thrawn campaign. As a military commander, Drayson was considered competent but not very creative, which left him rather outmatched when Grand Admiral Thrawn carried out an elaborate attack against Coruscant. His intense personal loyalty to Mon Mothma also led to some friction with Garm Bel Iblis, as he felt the Corellian General had betrayed Mothma by splitting away from the Rebel Alliance years earlier. Later, Drayson's command experience, strategic mind and extensive contacts made him the ideal candidate for first Director of Alpha Blue, and Mon Mothma appointed him under decree D9020616.
            After decades of service in the New Republic Intelligence Service apparatus, years that earned him the nickname "the Old Ghost of Coruscant", Drayson retired from service following Borsk Fey'lya's election and was married to Joi Eicroth for a time. He had a daughter, Bhindi Drayson, who also served in New Republic Intelligence, as well as Wraith Squadron.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hiram_Drayson</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHiramDrayson</string></dict>

At some point during his life, Hikmat was featured in Action Tidings and Figg Daily Bulletin after apprehending a group of Moogan art smugglers. He co-piloted one of two Storm IV Twin-Pod cloud cars near Cloud City in 3 ABY when the Millennium Falcon arrived there. One Cloud Car fired warning shots at the freighter before escorting it to a landing platform.
            This character's co-pilot, Jell Spiel, was most prominently seen as an action figure in Kenner's The Empire Strikes Back toy line, though both pilots can be briefly glimpsed inside the Cloud Cars in the film. Close up photos of the Cloud Car prop used in the film shows two different pilots inside the pods, with then unnamed Hikmat distinguished by a mustache.[2][3][4] In 2010, Hasbro released an action figure based on this particular character, though the packaging mimics the original Kenner figure's, using the photo of the other pilot.[5] Hikmat's name and personal history were finally revealed in the Rogues Gallery feature of Star Wars Insider 148.
            The figures' full uniforms were based on concept art by Nilo Rodis-Jamero, which was later used to represent Rebel Alliance officer Kem Monnon in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Duncan_Hikmat</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDuncanHikmat</string></dict>

He was pursued by a rakghoul as he returned, his wife, Hester, asked Trewin, the gatekeeper, to open the gate and let him back in. Unwilling to risk exposing the entire village to a rakghoul attack, Trewin reluctantly refused. It was then that the amnesiac Revan intervened, choosing to step outside the walls to help the stranger. Revan and Carth Onasi's combat skills were more than a match for the rakghoul, and Hendar was reunited with his wife.[1]
            He, like all the other Outcasts, left for the Promised Land when Revan later brought back enough evidence for Rukil, the village elder, to deduce its location. His reason for venturing into the open Undercity was not revealed, however it was likely that he was hoping to scavenge food or medicine from one of the Republic escape pods that had crashed nearby.[1]

        <key>Seff Hellin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.137.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Seff Hellin was a Jedi Knight who served during the time period following the Second Galactic Civil War. He had been a student at the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 and was approximately fourteen when it was evacuated during the war with the Yuuzhan Vong. He wore his hair in a curly style.
            Hellin was one of the first Jedi in the New Jedi Order to develop the Force-related psychosis that came upon the galaxy in 43 ABY.
            Seff Hellin was born in 12 ABY.
            During the Yuuzhan Vong War Seff Hellin along with the other Jedi Younglings were sent to Shelter in the Maw. It was during this time that the being Abeloth contacted the younglings and put the madness in him that would come when he was older. The Jedi Masters wouldn't know about this until years later.
            He went on to train as a Jedi.
            By 43.5 ABY he was a full Jedi Knight.
            Hellin rescued Han Solo and his family when Allana was kidnapped on Taris. These actions involved killing or maiming several members of an arms syndicate based on Denon. Because he had no authority to act on Taris, Seff was ordered by Galactic Alliance Intelligence agents to surrender his lightsaber. He was told by Leia Organa Solo to do so and that she would call Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker on his behalf, but Seff refused, stating that Skywalker "didn't understand."
            He then disarmed and temporarily paralyzed the intelligence agents attempting to take him into custody with the Force, and fled the room at incredible speed. This led Leia to comment that he should not have been able to do that, meaning his abilities had progressed beyond what was normal. Seff was then declared a rogue Jedi, refusing to submit to the authority of the Masters by returning to Coruscant.
            His actions on Taris caused even further distrust of the Jedi on the part of Chief of State Natasi Daala, which led her to dispatch a team of Mandalorians to bring him into custody. As a result of this, Luke Skywalker was forced to recall all of the Jedi to the Temple at Coruscant until further notice, as well as try to reassure Daala that the Jedi were self-policing and that Mandalorians should not be involved.
            It was known that Seff was extremely distrustful of Daala's intentions towards the Jedi and the Mandalorians involvement in Galactic Alliance affairs. So much so that he approached Lando Calrissian—without the authority or knowledge of the New Jedi Order—about Tendrando Arms producing a Mandalorian Hunter Droid similar to the YVH class of droids. This conversation occurred only a month or two before the events on Taris.
            After hearing of Valin Horn's mental state, Seff came to believe that he and Valin were the only ones who had not been replaced by impostors. Seff spent weeks planning to rescue Valin from the prison where he was being held encased in carbonite. During his rescue attempt, Seff was captured by a group of conspirators known as Darkmeld led by Jaina Solo and Jagged Fel. Seff was sedated and secretly brought back to the Asylum Block in the Jedi Temple where Master Cilghal and Jedi Knight Tekli tried to ascertain the nature of his mania.
            When Chief Daala attempted to gain possession of all psychotic Jedi, the Solos smuggled them out of the Temple, and took them to the academy on Shedu Maad.
            In 44 ABY, Hellin and the other Jedi suffering from the mysterious Force psychosis snapped out of their delusions in the aftermath of Luke Skywalker's first battle with Abeloth on Abeloth's planet. They were brought from Shedu Maad to the Jedi Temple by Zekk and Tekli. Hellin participated in the rescue of Jysella and Valin Horn as a member of "Team Saav'etu." Disguised as exterminators, the team used foam coating to mask the cam bubbles of the facility and then breached the outer walls with thermal detonators.
            Inside, the team discovered thousands of prisoners frozen in carbonite alongside the Horn siblings. During the raid, Hellin provided security for his team's escape and managed to destroy one of two Galactic Alliance Security troopsleds.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Seff_Hellin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSeffHellin</string></dict>

        <key>Set Harth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.139.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Set Harth was a male Human Dark Jedi active during the decades following the Ruusan Reformations of the Galactic Republic. Formerly a Padawan of the Jedi Order, his Master Aru-Wen was slain during the waning days of the Ruusan campaign in the New Sith Wars. After Aru-Wen's death during the final battle of the war on Ruusan, Harth was trained by Master Obba of the Council of First Knowledge. Obba's obsession in the research of Sith artifacts led to Harth's fascination with the Sith, and Harth fell to the dark side of the Force. Harth then abandoned the Order and moved to Nal Hutta, where he set up a mansion, as well as on other planets under his many disguises, to store all the dark side artifacts he could find.
            In 980 BBY, Harth recovered several artifacts that had been excavated on Doan. However, he was tracked down and bested by Sith Lord Darth Zannah, who forced him to become her would-be Sith apprentice while she hunted down her Master, Darth Bane.
            Together, Harth and Zannah found out that Bane had been captured and taken to the Stone Prison in Doan. Zannah went inside to confront her master, leaving Harth to guard their ship. However, Harth entered the prison and found the holocron of Darth Andeddu, which had been taken from Bane following the Dark Lord's capture. Harth then fled the prison, but not before briefly encountering his replacement, Darth Cognus, and began studying the method of transfer essence under the holocron's gatekeeper.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Set Harth was inducted into the Jedi Order, training in the ways of the Force under the tutelage of Jedi Master Aru-Wen at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. When the Temple battlemaster, Jedi Lord Hoth, raised the Army of Light from among the holdings of the Jedi Lords spread across the galaxy, Harth's master departed Coruscant to join in the fighting. Harth joined him briefly, succumbing to his anger while battling a warrior of Lord Kaan's Brotherhood of Darkness. Due to Harth's violent tendencies, Aru-Wen ordered his Padawan to return to the Coruscant Temple while he traveled to Ruusan to join the Army of Light for the final showdown with Kaan.[2] During the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, Kaan used a thought bomb on the Army of Light, killing exactly 100 members of it who were selected to go down with Lord Hoth, including Aru-Wen.[1][2]
            Following his Master's death on Ruusan, Harth came under the tutelage of Master Obba. Working with the Ithorian Jedi, Harth began working with the Council of First Knowledge in their endeavors to locate and confiscate all Sith artifacts scattered across the galaxy. As he was assigned more and more tasks, Harth began to horde the artifacts he found, until eventually he had enough money to leave the Order and learn the ways of the dark side.[1]
            Harth heard rumors of a Sith artifact that had survived the catastrophe on Ruusan. He tracked the artifact to an abandoned Sith armory on the Ruusan battlefields, where he battled a dark side warrior for possession of the artifact. Harth defeated the warrior and gained possession of the artifact, which further corrupted him.[2] Harth set up a mansion on Nal Hutta and began searching for other Sith artifacts.[1]
            One of Harth's searches led him to the palace of a Hutt slaver, where he encountered another Dark Jedi, Bal Serinus. The two dueled each other to exhaustion. Before the two dark siders could finish their duel, they were both caught by the Hutt slaver. While they were imprisoned in separate cells, Harth and Serinus communicated through the Force. Harth promised himself to protect Serinus from harm until she suddenly rebuffed his telepathic contact, in light of which Harth took a vow of vengeance.[2]
            In 980 BBY, Harth traveled to the planet Doan to recover several recently excavated Sith artifacts. He forced a Rodian bartender, Quano, to take him to the miner who had dug up the artifacts, Draado. As Draado attempted to rally the miners to go to war with the Doan Royal House in retaliation of the recent assassination of their leader, Gelba, Harth ambushed them. The other miners were quickly killed, but Draado survived for a short time due to the help of the artifacts he wore. However, Harth managed to Force choke the miner and kill him before taking the artifacts from him and returning to Nal Hutta.[1]
            After Harth returned home, Darth Zannah, the apprentice of Darth Bane, tracked Harth to Nal Hutta and, after a brief duel in Harth's estate, offered him the opportunity to become her own apprentice. Harth realized that if he refused, she would kill him, and accepted. The two traveled to Bane's home on Ciutric IV, where Zannah and Bane had been living, only to discover that Bane had been captured by the Royal Guard of the Doan Royal House. Unbeknownst to Zannah and Harth, Princess Serra of Doan, who had ordered the attack, was actually Caleb's daughter. She sought revenge on Bane, whom she mistakenly believed had killed her father.[1]
            Zannah and Harth returned to Doan to rescue Bane from the Stone Prison, but he escaped from his cell with the help of Serra's bodyguard Lucia, who had fought under Bane as a member of the Gloom Walkers. Zannah ordered Harth to watch her vessel, the Victory, before entering the prison, where she located Bane and challenged him to a duel, hoping to defeat him and become the next Dark Lord of the Sith.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Set_Harth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSetHarth</string></dict>
        <key>Kenth Hamner</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.140.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kenth Hamner was a Human male Jedi Master in the New Jedi Order, and later its acting Grand Master. A native of the planet Corellia, he took Izal Waz as his apprentice. Hamner fought on the Order's behalf during the Yuuzhan Vong War, where he led the communication between the Order and the New Republic and earned a seat on the Jedi High Council. During the subsequent Dark Nest Crisis, Hamner was a loyal supporter of the New Republic's successor state, the Galactic Alliance, believing that the Order should primarily serve the interests of the Alliance. During the Second Galactic Civil War, Hamner followed the other Jedi in joining Grand Master Luke Skywalker's Jedi Coalition, which fought against the Sith-controlled Galactic Alliance. In 43 ABY, two years after the war's conclusion, Hamner was installed as the acting Grand Master of the Jedi Order when Chief of State Natasi Daala exiled Luke Skywalker for failing to prevent the damage caused during the previous war.
            Hamner's tenure as Grand Master was short, as the members of the Council and other senior Jedi, were dissatisfied with his leadership during the period of unrest between the Order and the government of Natasi Daala. While Hamner pursued a relatively lenient policy towards Daala and the Galactic Alliance, the rest of the Masters advocated a much more aggressive stance, especially when the Jedi Temple was besieged under Daala's orders. Ultimately, in 44 ABY, the Council believed that Hamner was responding poorly to the crisis on Coruscant and removed him from his position. After attempting to prevent the launch of StealthX starfighters off Coruscant to aid Luke Skywalker against the Lost Tribe of Sith, an act he believed to be treasonous, he attacked Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne, who led the militant faction of the Jedi. Hamner was killed during his duel with Sebatyne, who took his place as Grand Master until Skywalker's return.
            Kenth Hamner was born into a wealthy family on Corellia. He served in the Combined Defense Forces of the New Republic, reaching the military rank of colonel before resigning his commission to accept Jedi training from Luke Skywalker.[1] Sometime after he completed his training, Hamner served a salted nerfloaf to his Arcona student Izal Waz. By doing so, he unwittingly sent his apprentice into a salt addiction that threw him off his Jedi path.[4]
            During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Hamner was the official liaison officer between the New Republic military and the Jedi. In the first year of the war, Hamner was at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 when smuggler Talon Karrde arrived to speak with the Jedi. While waiting for the meeting to begin, Hamner listed with several other Jedi as Jacen Solo and Anakin Solo argued over Anakin's desire to accept an offer to go to the Corellian system and reactivate Centerpoint Station to use in defense against the Yuuzhan Vong. The argument ended shortly after Karrde arrived with Luke Skywalker, and Karrde informed them that the Hutts, who had recently struck a deal with the invaders, had ceased shipments of spice to the Tynnani, Both, and Corellian systems, indicating they may be the next targets of the Yuuzhan Vong. Hamner asked him if there was any way to approach the Hutts and ask them, and Karrde told him that the New Republic Intelligence Service was attempting to do just that, but if the Jedi could bring the information to them, it might improve their image. Hamner and the other Jedi decided to send Jedi Master Kyp Durron and Jedi Knight Ganner Rhysode with Karrde to meet with a Hutt representative to try and gain the information.[1]
            Several months later, Hamner was on Coruscant, where he served as a strategist for the New Republic military, while also attending Jedi meetings. At one meeting, he reported to several other Jedi that the military was being forced to withdraw from places within the Inner Rim and the Colonies without reinforcements from the destroyed Fondor Shipyards. Hamner thanked the Force that Anakin had reactivated Centerpoint so that it could be used to defended nearby systems if it got repaired, but Anakin pointed out that the New Republic was now in danger of being kicked out of the Corellian system by the new government there. Hamner told him not to blame himself for the situation that had occurred when he reactivated Centerpoint, and that he had handled himself well in a difficult situation. The Jedi then discussed various reports from other Jedi stationed around the galaxy looking for signs of Yuuzhan Vong activity, as well as a report from Tekli, Master Cilghal's Padawan, who reported overhearing a suspicious conversation she believed might be about a Yuuzhan Vong infiltrator on Coruscant.[5]
            As the war entered its second year, Hamner's status as a liaison with the New Republic alerted him to an arrest warrant placed by Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya, which was aimed at keeping Skywalker and his wife, Mara Jade Skywalker, under house arrest. Hamner went to the Skywalker's residence, and after congratulating Mara on her pregnancy, he informed them of the arrest order, which was based on the testimony of a Peace Brigade member "released" by the Yuuzhan Vong who claimed Luke and Mara were behind a violation of the tenuous cease-fire agreement between the New Republic and the Yuuzhan Vong on Yavin 4. Hamner also told them that Fey'lya had only ordered the arrest order due to intense political pressure, trying to keep a moderate stance on the Jedi issue. Luke asked him what his opinion on the situation was, and Hamner told him that Luke would likely be expected to make a statement condemning any unsanctioned Jedi activity. Luke refused to do so, and Hamner agreed with him, and that Fey'lya had made no move to impound their ships yet, so he likely just wanted them in exile in case he ever needed them. Mara was angry with Fey'lya, but as she expressed her disappointment, she cried out in pain and collapsed, with the illness that had been plaguing her reemerging. Hamner transported both Skywalkers back to their apartment where doctors were waiting, and bid them farewell.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kenth_Hamner</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKenthHamner</string></dict>
        <key>Hamato Xiono</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.141.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hamato Xiono was a human male senator in the New Republic Senate and the father of Kazuda Xiono. During the latter years of Republic rule in the galaxy, Senator Xiono facilitated his son's entry into a New Republic military academy which, in turn, led to Kazuda's service in the New Republic Defense Fleet's Starfighter Corps.
            Senator Hamato Xiono was a politician who served in the Galactic Senate of the New Republic years after the Galactic Civil War. He was also the father of Kazuda Xiono, whose service to the Republic Hamato facilitated by supporting his son's enrollment in a New Republic military academy. He then ensured that Kazuda's training was put to use by helping him join the New Republic Defense Fleet, allowing Kazuda to pursue his aspirations of becoming a highly skilled pilot.[1]
            In 34 ABY, Kazuda contacted Senator Xiono shortly after his rendezvous with the Resistance during the waning months of the cold war. Believing the First Order, a successor state to the Galactic Empire, threatened the Republic's place in the galaxy, Kazuda decided to join the Resistance but also felt compelled to inform Hamato about his decision. However, Kazuda ultimately changed his mind, deciding to keep his new connection a secret from his father, who regarded General Leia Organa as a leader of extremists.[1]
            Sometime later, the First Order rose from the Unknown Regions and proclaimed the end of the New Republic, firing Starkiller Base's superlaser and destroying the Hosnian system. Upon witnessing this, Kazuda became horrified, fearing that his father was gone, along with his friends and the Senate.[2]
            Hamato Xiono was a human male. Coming from a position of wealth and influence, the senator was able to support his son Kazuda Xiono's aspirations to become a New Republic pilot. Although Hamato was willing to aid Kazuda in his endeavors, he felt that his son relied on him for everything—from entering the academy to joining the New Republic Navy.[1]
            Senator Xiono regarded the Resistance as a band of extremists and was disturbed by his son mentioning their organization. Ultimately, Kazuda kept his relationship with the Resistance a secret from his father, hoping to achieve something on his own without the senator's help for once.[1]

        <key>Griff Halloran</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.142.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Griff Halloran was a human male pilot who served with the Ace Squadron during the era of the New Republic. Halloran's past, prior to his time flying defense for the Colossus refueling station, was shrouded in mystery. Although he wore a customized version of the TIE fighter pilot uniform, even going so far as to sport an Imperial crest tattoo on both of his arms, it was unknown whether Halloran actually was a veteran of the Imperial Navy or if he simply evoked the memory of the former Galactic Empire to appear more intimidating.
            Like his teammates, Halloran was an accomplished pilot who owned a starfighter, suited to his attributes. The Black Ace was an extensively modified TIE/ln space superiority starfighter; Halloran designed the modifications himself in order to turn his racer into a unique and fearsome machine that emphasized raw power.
            Griff Halloran was a pilot who spent his latter years flying defense for the Colossus refueling station[1] during the era of the New Republic.[2] Halloran flew the colors of the former Galactic Empire[1] while serving with Ace Squadron—a team of exceptional starfighter pilots—during his time as a pilot and racer.[2] Although his appearance evoked the bygone days of the Imperial Era, no one was certain whether Halloran truly was a veteran of the Imperial Navy or if he simply utilized Imperial imagery to intimidate his foes.[1]
            Much of Griff Halloran's personality was reflected in his personal starship, the Black Ace. Favoring a unique and fearsome design, Halloran's customized ship was an aggressively powerful and aerodynamic machine, although to some observers his extensive modifications were regarded as too drastic.[5] While his alleged affiliation with the old Galactic Empire was the subject of rumors,[1] Halloran nonetheless sported two Imperial crest tattoos, one on each arm.[2]
            Halloran was a human male with gray hair, gray eyes, and light skin.[1]
            Griff Halloran was an accomplished pilot whose abilities enabled him to fly and race alongside the best pilots on the Colossus platform.[2] In addition, he was a skilled mechanic who made many personal modifications and extensive refittings to his own Imperial-issue TIE/ln space superiority starfighter.[5]
            During the cold war, Griff Halloran wore a modified flight suit which included parts of the equipment utilized by TIE fighter pilots. His black flight helmet was also designed by the former Empire, although he customized it by adding white paint to the faceplate.[2]
            Griff Halloran is a character created and developed for the Star Wars Resistance animated series. He is voiced by Stephen Stanton, who voiced Wilhuff Tarkin in Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Griff_Halloran</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGriffHalloran</string></dict>
        <key>Nejaa Halcyon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.143.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nejaa Halcyon was a Human male Corellian Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Unbeknownst to the Jedi High Council, Master Halcyon was married to a Corellian woman and was the biological father of Valin Halcyon. During his service to the Order, he befriended the Caamasi Jedi Ylenic It'kla, who remembered him as Spicewood in his memnii. He was soon slain by the Dark Acolyte Nikkos Tyris towards the end of the war, but was survived by his family even after the fall of the Republic and the disbandment of the Order. His wife, Scerra, married Halcyon's friend Rostek Horn, and took his surname in order to further hide their identities from the Galactic Empire.
            Like almost all Jedi in the later days of the Galactic Republic, Nejaa Halcyon was identified at an early age as Force-sensitive and taken to Coruscant for training as an Initiate of the Jedi Order. Crafting a silver-bladed lightsaber for his own use, Halcyon would progress through the ranks of the Order in the ensuing years— achieving the rank of Jedi Knight by 60 BBY. After additional training as a Jedi Guardian as well as dabbling in the work of the recruiters of the Acquisition Division, Halcyon ascended to the rank of Jedi Master and was presented with a Credit chip, a tradition amongst the Corellian Jedi. He would later present this medallion to his good friend and Corellian Security Force member Rostek Horn.[4]
            Master Halcyon worked with the Acquisition Division circa 30 BBY, working as a recruiter on the Outer Rim Territories. It was around this time that Master Halcyon discovered the Force-sensitive Twi'lek Boc Aseca; Halcyon determined the boy to be too old to begin training on Coruscant and refused him admittance into the Order.[5] While loyal to the Order and the Jedi High Council, Master Halcyon disobeyed the Jedi Code by taking marriage vows with a Corellian woman named Scerra. Together, without the High Council's knowledge, the couple had a child who they named Valin. While Halcyon worked to hide his family from the Order, he always suspected that Grand Master Yoda knew of the child.[6]
            When the Corellian sector closed its borders during the Separatist Crisis, Halcyon led a contingent of Corellian Jedi to the planet to insure that the system's security was up to par. The groups' involvement in the sector raised questions as to where their loyalties were placed; the group returned to the Republic proper after their investigation, stating that, "Our commitment is to the Jedi Council and the Republic that it serves, but we are Corellians by blood and will always have a connection to our home."[1]
            As the Separatist Crisis between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Master Halcyon led a team of Jedi Knights to locate and recapture the Scarlet Thranta, a rogue Judicial Department corvette whose captain and crew had defected from the Republic. Intercepting the ship, Halcyon hailed the rogue Captain Zozridor Slayke over the planet Bpfassh. Slayke dispatched his lieutenant, a Rodian named Grudo, to aggravate Halcyon and attempt to defeat him in a fight. While Halcyon was distracted with Grudo, Captain Slayke managed to slip under the notice of the Jedi and board Halcyon's ship, the Plooriod Bodkin. Fleeing the world, Halcyon and his crew were left stranded for months with their single prisoner; Halcyon was disgraced in the media and lost the respect of many of his peers, though no one mentioned his failure around the Temple. Having been rescued by the High Council, Halcyon was stripped of his command of the mission to hunt Slayke and found himself resigned to sitting around the Temple without an assignment.[3]
            When the Clone Wars erupted out of the Separatist Crisis, Halcyon received many minor missions, but did not lead many large battles early in the war. Assigned to Corellia late in 22 BBY, Halcyon went undercover as the scientist Ratri Tane so as to gain information against the CIS. Later, Jedi Aayla Secura and Ylenic It'kla were dispatched to find Tane and retrieve the information he had gathered. Discovering that Tane was actually Master Halcyon, the Jedi managed to succeed in the mission and keep the information from the Confederacy.[7]
            Eventually, Master Halcyon was given his first major assignment by the High Council. Recommended by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine by name, Halcyon quickly accepted the mission, and took the news that he would be serving alongside Captain Zozridor Slayke with grace. Charged with protecting the Intergalactic Communications Center on Praesitlyn from the Confederacy, Halcyon chose Jedi Anakin Skywalker as his second in command, having gotten to know him during his time stationed at the Temple. Devising a battle plan to relieve Slayke's outnumbered organization, the Freedom's Sons, Halcyon and Skywalker's initial plan was met with failure. Crafting a desperate rescue mission for the men and women on the ground, Halcyon was able to lead a successful assault on the planet while Skywalker was able to capture Separatist Admiral Pors Tonith.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nejaa_Halcyon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNejaaHalcyon</string></dict>
        <key>Keiran Halcyon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.144.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Keiran Halcyon was a Human male Corellian Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic roughly four hundred years before the rise of the Galactic Empire and the start of the Great Jedi Purge.
            Discovered to be Force-sensitive and inducted into the academy of the Jedi Order, Keiran Halcyon eventually passed his Trials of Knighthood and was made a Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. Pursuing independent study along the path of the Jedi Guardian, Halcyon became a noted Corellian Jedi, taking on several missions that related to safeguarding his home system. One such accomplishment was the halting of the notorious and destructive Selonian Afarathu cult in 380 BBY. While designing his lightsaber, Halcyon imbued the weapon with a rare Durindfire gem, which gave his blade a unique silver color. Additionally, using Jedi techniques stored deep in the Jedi Temple's Archives, Halcyon was able to produce a lightsaber blade that could extend up to 3 meters in length.[1]
            While strong in the Force, the Halcyon bloodline was known to be weak in telekinetic abilities, one of the abilities that Jedi were widely known for. However, instead of being weakened by this seeming impediment, those of the Halcyon family that became Jedi enhanced their gifts of alter mind and absorb energy to give them advantages where other Jedi might be weaker.[1]
            Long after Halcyon's death, his bloodline produced at least two more Jedi, the famed Jedi Master Nejaa Halcyon who served bravely during the Clone Wars, and Corran Horn. Horn was born into a time of conflict in the galaxy, when the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious outlawed Jedi training and strove to eliminate the Order's history from galactic records. However, as the Galactic Empire was overthrown and the Jedi Order rose from the ashes, Horn joined the fledgling Order under the name of his ancestor, Keiran Halcyon. Studying under Luke Skywalker at the Yavin 4 Jedi Praxeum, Horn eventually dropped the alias and went onto to become a prominent member of the Jedi High Council.[2]
            The Jedi Academy Training Manual mistakenly states that Keiran lived in the same era as Luke Skywalker, and was even his student for a brief time, while he in fact lived 400 years prior to Luke Skywalker's birth. This error is due to a retcon from the book I, Jedi, where it is revealed that the Keiran Halcyon that appeared in the Jedi Academy Trilogy was actually Corran Horn, a distant descendant of the original Halcyon. Horn used the alias upon Skywalker's suggestion, so that it would not become public knowledge that he was training as a Jedi.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Keiran_Halcyon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKeiranHalcyon</string></dict>

            A Force-sensitive Human, Leor Hal was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order at its Coruscant Jedi Temple. During his training as a Padawan, Hal developed the Potentium and established a sizable following of fellow apprentices. Having formed a cult in the eyes of the Jedi High Council, Hal's followers were cast out from the Temple circa 132 BBY, causing him to renounce his training in protest and leave as well.[2]
            Without his followers, Hal wandered through space for years until he eventually found the living planet Zonama Sekot. In 89 BBY, he encouraged groups of Ferroan and Langhesi colonists to settle on the planet, and he made himself the first Magister of the planet. During his time there, Hal discovered the being Sekot, with whom Hal formed a symbiotic relationship with and used this to help transform the planet into a thriving manufacturing organ. Having imprinted his own philosophy of the Force on Sekot and the settlers, Hal began the Zonama Sekot Shipbuilders and the planet began manufacturing hyperdrives beneath the planet's surface as well as the rare living ships the planet was famed for.[3]
            Following his death, the citizens of Zonama banned speaking the name of their leader in reverence to his great deeds. Taking up the reigns of governance, Hal's son led the planet from his distant palace for sometime until the arrival of the Far Outsiders. Unbeknownst to the Zonaman people, the Magister and his palace were destroyed, with Sekot crafting a hologram to report to his people and maintain the calm of the populace.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Leor_Hal</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLeorHal</string></dict>

Prior to his service in the Empire, Hux had served as a junior officer in the Grand Army of the Republic, communicating tactics and strategy as determined by Jedi generals. Some four years before the Battle of Yavin, he was the commandant of the Arkanis Academy. Hux created the Commandant's Cadets, a secret society within his academy, made up of handpicked cadets. After the Imperial defeat at Endor, he was trapped by the New Republic during the Siege of Arkanis. However, he escaped with the help of bounty hunter Mercurial Swift, on the orders of Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, who appointed him a member of the new Shadow Council. He eventually sired an illegitimate son, Armitage, who would go on to become a general of the First Order as one of its first leaders.
            During the Clone Wars, Brendol Hux was a junior officer in the Grand Army of the Republic who communicated tactics and strategies devised by the Galactic Republic's Jedi Generals. Hux admired the combat prowess and dedication of the Republic's clone troopers and the Jedi Order, who had been trained from youth as soldiers and warriors. Following the transformation of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, Hux continued serving the Imperial Military and was eventually transferred to the Imperial Academy on Arkanis. To help run the Academy, Hux also employed the services of a servant droid called DDM-38 or DeeDee, who was charged with keeping the cadets in line. Dissatisfied with the caliber of the Empire's stormtroopers, who were normal human recruits, Hux conceived the idea of training stormtrooper recruits from birth who would be excellent soldiers and loyal servants of the Empire.[2]
            Unable to find fellow officers who would support his ideas, Hux decided to create his own loyal cadre of officers from among the Imperial cadets at the Arkanis Academy. Eventually, Hux succeeded in creating a secret society known as the Commandant's Cadets which operated outside of the official Imperial hierarchy. To join the Commandant's Cadets, prospective members had to kill a fellow cadet while making their deaths appear to be an accident. As a result, several cadets were killed under suspicious circumstances during training exercises. Commandant's Cadets were given special privileges including being allowed to sit at a special table in the Academy's mess hall. About four years before the Battle of Yavin, Hux had recruited at least ten Commandant's Cadets including Orman le Hivre and Rav Horan.[2]
            Shortly later, a promising young cadet from Lothal named Zare Leonis was transferred to the Arkanis Academy as a "reward" for his loyalty to the Empire. However, this was a ruse created by the Grand Inquisitor, who wanted to investigate Zare's ties to Dev Morgan's rebel cell. In reality, Leonis was a secret rebel sympathizer who had joined the Academy in order to find his sister Dhara Leonis, who had been forcibly inducted by the Grand Inquisitor into Project Harvester, which was based in Area Null, a secluded tower attached to the Arkanis Academy.[2]
            Following Leonis' arrival, Hux identified Anya Razar as a prospective candidate for the Commandant's Cadets. Later, Anya was placed in charge of a five-member scouting mission during a field exercise that included the Cadets Leonis, Penn Zarang, Tigard Manes, Chan Harra, and Xan Lanier, a low-performing Cadet who had been marked for death by the Commandant's Cadets. As part of this field exercise, the cadets and their diplopod mounts had to navigate forward while under live-fire. During that exercise, Lanier was killed in an explosion that also killed his and Leonis' diplopod mounts. Lanier's death was subsequently hushed up and Razar was formally inducted during into the Commandant's Cadets during a night ceremony at Area Null. When Leonis tried to follow Razar and the Commandant's Cadets into the tower, he was stopped by DeeDee, who issued him with demerits.[2]
            After Razar's induction, Commandant Hux convened an assembly at the banquet hall which was followed by dinner. During the dinner, the Commandant was visited by the Grand Inquisitor, who spoke to Hux privately. Leonis observed the meeting and noted that the two Imperial officials were arguing. When the Inquisitor noticed Leonis looking at them, he ceased arguing with Hux. Following the dinner, the Grand Inquisitor summoned Leonis for a private meeting at the Commandant's balcony, with the consent of Hux. During the meeting, the Inquisitor warned Leonis that he was close to uncovering his secret connection to the Spectres. Before he could interrogate Leonis further, he was recalled for a priority mission to Lothal which subsequently claimed his life.[2]
            A few days later, Commandant Hux, with DeeDee's assistance, summoned the Academy's cadets to a cliff edge overlooking a nearby beach. A nerf calf had strayed from the Academy's grounds to search the beach for salt only to be devoured by a sea monster. Hux took the opportunity to lecture the cadets about the value of training and asked them to come up with ideas on how to prevent future incidents from recurring. When Tigard Manes suggested a gate, the Commandant responded that gates would delay those who had business on the sea and reminded the cadets that they could not wall themselves from all of the galaxy's dangers. He then challenged the other cadets to come up with other ideas.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brendol_Hux</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBrendolHux</string></dict>
        <key>Khurgee</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.148.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Khurgee was a Human male captain in the Imperial Military who served aboard the first Death Star.
            In 0 BBY, Khurgee was apparently a qualified pilot, but he spent an important part of his career as a docking-bay security officer. He served first aboard the Star Destroyer Thunderflare, where he was honored for bravery after rescuing five officers from a shuttle crash. He was later assigned to the first Death Star.[1]
            While the battle station lingered in the rubble of the Alderaan system, Khurgee was the security officer in charge of searching the Millennium Falcon in Docking Bay 327. He led the initial inspection in person, and reported to Darth Vader, before summoning a scanner team to perform a more thorough search. He perished onboard the Death Star during its destruction.[1]
            Khurgee's biography derives largely from his card in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game; the reference to his piloting qualification is based on the more recent Wizards of the Coast card game, which uses an image of him, coupled with Chief Bast's line "Should I have your ship standing by?", to depict a Helmsman.[2]
            Among Star Wars fans, there is a relatively widespread belief that Khurgee held the rank of Line Captain in the Imperial Navy. However, there is no canon support for this statement, which seems to derive from the Star Wars Technical Commentaries website's interpretation of his rank insignia.[3]
            Although he is not credited in the film, Khurgee was played by actor Christopher Muncke.[4] His voiced was dubbed by Harry Shearer.
            The novel Death Star incorrectly identifies Khurgee as a lieutenant.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Khurgee</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKhurgee</string></dict>
        <key>Edmos Khurgee</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.149.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Edmos Khurgee was a male human who served the Galactic Empire as a captain during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. During the war he served on board the Death Star, and was in charge of having the Millennium Falcon searched when it was brought on board by the station's tractor beams.
            A male human, Edmos Khurgee came to serve as an officer in the military of the Galactic Empire,[1] a fascist regime led by Emperor Sheev Palpatine.[2] As such, he participated in the Galactic Civil War, in which the Empire fought the Alliance to Restore the Republic,[1] a resistance movement that sought to overthrow Palpatine and restore democracy to the galaxy.[3]
            At some point, Khurgee served as the model for the male officer appearing on the propaganda poster titled "COMPNOR Recruitment," which incited citizens to join the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order (or COMPNOR for short), an agency responsible for the propagation of the Empire's underlying ideology. While it hinted that the captain might have enjoyed a privileged relationship with COMPNOR officials, as cronyism was the norm at the time, it also started unfounded rumors that Khurgee and the artist, Dasita Lyros, were lovers.[2]
            In 0 BBY, Khurgee held the rank of captain, and he was stationed aboard the Death Star, the Empire's brand new sphere-shaped deep space mobile battle station. One day, the Death Star's tractor beams captured a Corellian freighter entering the area of space containing the remains of the planet Alderaan, which had just been destroyed by the battle station. When the captured craft, the Millennium Falcon, was deposited in Docking Bay 327, Captain Khurgee led the initial inspection in person, searching the premises and checking the ship's log. Because there did not seem to be anyone on board, and because the log recorded that the crew abandoned ship immediately after takeoff, the captain concluded the Falcon might have been merely a decoy. Khurgee then reported his observations and conclusions to Darth Vader, the Emperor's black-armored enforcer, who nevertheless ordered him to send a scanning crew aboard to perform a more thorough search.[1]
            While on duty aboard the Death Star, Edmos wore a gray Imperial officer's uniform[1] made of gaberwool,[4] including a cap with an identity disk. He wore two code cylinders and a rank insignia plaque on his breast. The plaque showed a single row of six amber squares.[1]
            Captain Khurgee first appeared in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope in 1977.[1] Although not credited in the film, he was played by Chicago native and actor Christopher Muncke.[5] The first name "Edmos" was created by Pablo Hidalgo for the 2016 reference book Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy.[2]
            Muncke's scenes were shot in one day at Elstree Studios near London, England. The actor recalls that, while he expected the make up crew to cut his hair because he was going to play a military officer, they told him they only needed to trim it a little, because the movie takes place in a totally different time altogether.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Edmos_Khurgee</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascEdmosKhurgee</string></dict>
        <key>Haazen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.150.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Haazen was a failed Padawan-turned Dark Jedi who lived during the time of the Great Sith War and Mandalorian Wars. Alongside his best friend Barrison Draay, whose family Haazen's own had served as stewards and retainers for generations, Haazen was a student of Jedi Master Arca Jeth and a close friend of Krynda Hulis, Barrison's future wife.
            Though he failed to achieve Knighthood, Haazen continued to serve the Order as a field mortician during the Great Sith War. Eventually, Haazen betrayed the Jedi and participated in a Sith conspiracy that resulted in the death of countless Jedi, including his liege. However, Haazen suffered many injuries in the process. His dark thoughts well hidden, Haazen aided Krynda, now the mother of Barrison's son in forming her secret organization for the purpose of preventing the return of the Sith, serving her faithfully until he could wrest control of the Covenant from her and set his own plans in motion. Around that time, Haazen had been the mentor of Lucien Draay and confidant.
            When Krynda became critically ill, Haazen hid her and became the acting leader of the Covenant in her stead, pulling the strings on Lucien and his comrades into his control, having all but his old student killed one by one. But as he finally came close in taking control of the Jedi Order, Haazen was defeated by Lucien and his former Padawan, Zayne Carrick.
            Haazen's Jedi training took place on Arkania under Arca Jeth. His fellow students included his old friend, Barrison Draay, and Krynda Hulis. Haazen was a member of the family that served as stewards for the royal Draay family, so Haazen came on essentially as Barrison's servant, though the two eventually became good friends.[3]
            Unlike his fellow students, Haazen didn't develop into a Force virtuoso, his abilities with it remaining, as he termed it, awkward. His abilities were so negligible that when he was trailing the Nautolan smuggler Dossa, he was easily beaten in physical combat when she confronted him. Taunting him with his stolen lightsaber, Dossa proceeded to topple a nearby obelisk onto Haazen, shooting the base with her blaster. It was only Barrison's intervention that saved his life.[3]
            At the time, preparations were being made for the knighting of Arca Jeth's students, and Barrison attended a celebration put on by his family, Haazen and Krynda as his guests. At the subsequent knighting ceremony, Barrison and Krynda were knighted, but Haazen was not. Haazen's compromised abilities, lack of perception and predictable temperament made him unfit for knighthood. Enraged, Haazen stormed out into the snow outside.[3]
            Barrison came out to console him, but Haazen lashed out at him. Barrison Draay, as well as being his friend, was also the subject of his envy, having everything he himself wanted; money, honor, and a relationship with Krynda. Barrison responded by punching Haazen, but realizing that this was wrong, forgave Haazen for his behavior, and offered the failed Jedi another way to continue serving him.[3]
            During the Great Sith War, Haazen continued to serve Barrison, but as his assistant, not a Jedi. He did not participate in the direct battles, and his work consisted of taking care of the bodies that had remained in the battlefield. Krynda soon became Barrison's wife and bore a child named Lucien.[3]
            After the Battle of Toprawa, Haazen was approached once again by Dossa, who was now a servant of Exar Kun. Dossa teased him about his servitude to Barrison, and then offered Haazen a way to return as the only hero and get whatever he wanted, asking what that was. Haazen proclaimed that he wanted Barrison's life and everything in it. Giving in to his hatred and envy, Haazen turned to the dark side and joined the Sith.[3]
            Dossa instructed Haazen to lead the Jedi forces into the Ansharii Caverns, a trap intended for the Jedi. However, Dossa purposefully detonated the charges before Haazen could get clear. Though he survived the blast, he lost both of his legs, his right arm and eye. However, his body was salvaged by Dossa, and he awoke in a Sith enclave some time later to find his injuries more or less healed, thanks to the efforts of Doctor Uburluh. But he was left heavily disfigured, and his missing limbs and eye had been replaced by grisly inhuman prostheses. In addition to the prosthesis, Haazen also had a Sith artifact known as the Yoke of Seeming implanted into his back. The Yoke caused the Living Force to flow past and around Haazen rather than through him, allowing his thoughts and feelings to remain clouded, unreadable by Jedi. Dossa theorized that the implantation of more Sith artifacts and equipment into Haazen's body could expand his powers and abilities, making him potentially invincible. When Dossa included the condition that he must quit the Jedi before they could help him, Haazen stated that he was neither Jedi nor Sith, aspiring to be something more. He then killed Dossa for all the humiliation he had suffered at her hands.[3]
            While he no longer remained with the Jedi Order, he continued to serve Krynda as her retainer, much as he served her late husband.[2] However, she remained unaware of his feelings for her nor his part in Barrison's death. Despite the Yoke of Seeming's power to subtly influence others, allowing them to accept his mutilated appearance, Haazen took to wearing an all-concealing cloak.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Haazen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHaazen</string></dict>
        <key>Erk H'Arman</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.151.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Erk H'Arman was a pilot and lieutenant in the Praesitlyn Defense Force. During the Clone Wars he flew T-19 starfighters for the Praesitlyn Defense Force with his wingman, Ensign Pleth Strom.
            When a droid force under Commander Pors Tonith attacked Praesitlyn in 22 BBY, H'Arman would be thrust into the forefront of a war zone, and would meet Odie Subu, his future wife, during the fighting on the planet. Additionally, H'Arman would distinguish himself in combat and serve alongside famed Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who presided over his and Subu's wedding ceremony.
            A Human male and military serviceman, Erk H'Arman was present on Praesitlyn in 22 BBY, some four weeks after the Battle of Geonosis,[2] where he served as a pilot for the indigenous defense forces under General Khamar alongside fellow pilot Pleth Strom. Bored of service on the planet, H'Arman was understandably excited when an enemy landing force comprised of myriad transports and escorted by hundreds of droid tri-fighters appeared in the skies over one of Praesitlyn's larger continents. He and Strom attacked the force; however, their control ship was shot down and the two pilots were unable to make any headway against the tri-fighters, who quickly overwhelmed Strom and H'Arman. With Strom dead[2] and his own craft disabled, H'Arman was able to effect a crash landing.[1]
            H'Arman's useless craft was detected by Odie Subu, a reconnaissance trooper attached to the overland segment of the Praesitlyn Defense Force under Khamar and Major Makx Maganinny. Having survived recent combat with several CIS mercenaries, Subu was shaken when H'Arman leveled his blaster at her, but the two quickly formed a bond and set off on Subu's speeder bike to find shelter amid the mounting chaos on Praesitlyn. Finding a cave with water, the two spent two days in the area recovering from the intense conditions of the desert. With no food, H'Arman and Subu were forced to travel on foot after a fault rendered Subu's speeder inoperable. Stranded in the desert with seemingly no salvation at hand, H'Arman experienced vivid hallucinations and witnessed an avian creature, a sight concocted by his heat-addled mind, attacking Odie. Drawing his blaster, H'Arman fired off a single shot.[1]
            That shot proved to be the only factor in their survival. Omin L'Loxx, a soldier serving with the Sons and Daughters of Freedom, a pro-Republic splinter force under the leadership of the renegade Zozridor Slayke, saw the shot and found the two soldiers. Informed of the Defense Force's fall and the Sons' mission to obliterate the CIS forces by L'Loxx, H'Arman readily joined the patriotic freelancers and piloted a speeder bike to the nearest Sons and Daughters-aligned outpost, called Izable, encountering a Gamorrean soldier on the way. His worth proven, H'Arman and Subu were assigned to protect the facility by the Bothan soldier D'Nore at a gunwell. Demonstrating his knowledge of the E-Web heavy repeating blaster, H'Arman helped Subu man the gunwell and assisted in the defense of the outpost against a legion of battle droids. However, when a convoy of droid tanks rolled towards the outpost, H'Arman was unable to heed the warnings of the frantic Subu, and was caught in the collapse of the bunker as a defensive counter-mine effort launched by the Sons thwarted the tanks' advance.[1]
            Trapped in the wreckage of the facility, H'Arman and Subu exchanged personal information and fell in love. Engineering an escape with a vibroknuckler, the two emerged from the base as a Republic counterattack against the CIS forces was underway. Subu fired impulsively on an approaching figure, believing it to be an enemy. That figure proved to be Grudo, a Rodian mercenary employed by the Republic to assist in the fighting. With that disturbing event past, H'Arman and Subu were taken to the Republic encampment. It was there that H'Arman, shocked to his stomach by the hardships encountered by the clone troopers onplanet, realized the true extent of the battle for Praesitlyn, and so he and Subu endeavored to assist the Republic by any means necessary. They later witnessed the terrifying results of an enemy attempt to subvert communications among the Republic forces.[1]
            H'Arman was later assigned to pilot a transport vessel into the embattled Intergalactic Communications Center, which had fallen into the hands of the CIS. Parting with Subu reluctantly, he and the recon trooper would reunite alive and well following the battle's conclusion. H'Arman and Subu would be married by Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi leading the assault alongside formerly disgraced Jedi Master Nejaa Halcyon.[1]
            A hardened soldier desiring an action-packed career, Erk H'Arman would get more than he bargained for when thrust into the heat of battle against an overwhelming enemy force. Though somewhat brash, H'Arman also possessed a softer side, and would willingly cooperate with any soldier whom he deemed to be fighting for the same cause. Although a catastrophic mistake during battle nearly killed himself and Odie Subu, Subu would see enough of H'Arman's positive traits to consider him a love interest.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Erk_H%27Arman</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascErkH'Arman</string></dict>

Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor,[1] Phurus was standing next to the wall opposite the entrance to Maz Kanata's castle on the planet Takodana when the smuggler Han Solo entered with the scavenger Rey, the former stormtrooper Finn and the astromech droid BB-8. Shortly after their entrance, many of the castle's patrons, Phurus included, rushed outside to witness the destruction of the Hosnian system by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon, after which First Order forces attacked and destroyed Kanata's castle.[2]
            While at the castle, Phurus wore red Tricorraan raider robes and carried a field-accelerated blaster rifle. He had dark skin and shaved black hair.[1]

        <key>Connor Freeman</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.155.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Connor Freeman was a Human male born to a clone deserter and his wife in 22 BBY. During his infancy, Freeman's father was killed by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett on Atzerri. Before Fett's death at the Battle of Geonosis, the Mandalorian left an inheritance fund to Freeman. Twenty years later, Freeman used the inheritance fund and won a game of sabacc against the crime lord Tayand, causing the crime lord to place a bounty on Freeman's head. He was eventually captured by Jango Fett's son Boba, who was also a bounty hunter. After Freeman was turned in to Tayand at the latter's base on Cilare, Fett killed the crime lord, liberating Freeman from the debt that Tayand imposed on the man.
            Connor Freeman, a Human male, was born in 22 BBY to a clone soldier who deserted the facilities on Kamino and his wife on the planet Atzerri. Eventually, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett, whom Freeman's father was cloned from, tracked the clone and killed him in his family's home on Atzerri[1] on behalf of the Sith Lord Count Dooku.[4] Freeman and his mother encountered Fett after the clone's death, and during a conversation between Fett and the clone's wife, the young infant mistook Fett for his father. The Mandalorian then departed the planet along with his son Boba. Sometime before Fett's death in the opening battle of the Clone Wars, the Mandalorian opened an inheritance fund for Freeman.[1]
            Twenty years later,[2] during the reign of the Galactic Empire, Freeman withdrew all the money from his inheritance fund and eventually played a game of sabacc against the crime lord Tayand. He won the game, which angered the crime lord, who accused Freeman of cheating at the game. Freeman escaped Tayand's enforcers, who opened blaster fire at the young man. After Freeman's escape, Tayand put a bounty on the man, claiming that Freeman owed him five hundred thousand credits.[5] Eventually, Freeman was located by a Gand bounty hunter in a cantina owned by the Besalisk Quinny. Freeman was given a blaster by Quinny, and he shot the Gand, killing him. As he was taking the Gand's corpse out of the cantina, he was attacked by other mercenaries,[1] who were a part of the League of Bounty Hunters.[2] After evading them, he was eventually captured and knocked into unconsciousness by Boba Fett who, like his father, had become a Mandalorian bounty hunter.[1]
            He awoke to find Fett and the ten bounty hunters arguing over who would turn Freeman in for the bounty, and ridiculed the mercenaries allied with the League of Bounty Hunters. During the comversation, the leader of the organization, Bossk, interjected and gave Fett permission to kill the other bounty hunters. Freeman escaped as Fett was disabling the other bounty hunters. However, Fett, who was using his jetpack to chase Freeman, caught him and used a spray of concentrated deeb aerosol to incapacitate Freeman. Later, Freeman awoke aboard Fett's ship Slave I, which was at a refueling station. He told the Mandalorian that his face resembled his father's, which led to Fett reasoning that he and Freeman were biological brothers. When Freeman insulted Fett by calling the latter's father scum, Fett revealed that he had helped his father kill Freeman's father. Freeman attacked Fett, causing them to fall out of the ship and onto the platform. As they were trying to kill each other, a ship commanded by Daquinn and the Whiphid[2] Yarttar[5]—who had survived the earlier skirmish with Fett—destroyed the refueling station, incapacitating both Fett and Freeman. The two bounty hunters captured Freeman[2] and brought him to the planet Cilare, where Tayand was based.[5]
            As he disambarked Tayand's and Yarttar's ship, Freeman began arguing with the two and killed the Whipid with his own blaster. As he prepared to attack Daquinn, Boba Fett—whom Daquinn believed was dead—managed to swoop in with his jetpack and capture Freeman. After they made it to Tayand's base, Freeman explained exactly why Tayand placed the bounty on him. When Fett and Freeman met with Tayand, Daquinn interrupted the meeting as the crime lord was about to pay the Mandalorian. After Tayand refused to pay Daquinn, Fett offered to pay the five hundred thousand credits that the crime lord claimed Freeman owed him. Tayand refused to accept Fett's money, and Freeman offered Fett three credits to kill Tayand. Fett accepted and killed the crime lord, prompting Tayand's employees to attack Freeman and Fett. During the ensuing skrimish, Fett freed the rancor that Tayand owned, which attacked Tayand's men. Freeman pushed Fett aside to prevent Daquinn from shooting the Mandalorian, and was shot in his left shoulder. Fett disabled Daquinn and placed his jetpack on the bounty hunter, waiting for the rancor's head to appear in front of opening of the room in which they were in. After Fett launched Daquinn in the rancor's mouth, the beast was killed, and Freeman paid Fett the three credits that he had offered for Tayand's death. After Freeman collected some of Tayand's treasure, he and Fett, who took a tooth from the dead rancor's mouth, parted ways.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Connor_Freeman</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascConnorFreeman</string></dict>
        <key>Ved Foslo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.156.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ved Foslo was a male human who was a native of the planet Coruscant, and son of the Imperial General Foslo. Ved attended the Royal Imperial Academy in the years leading up to the Galactic Civil War. His roommates were Thane Kyrell and Nash Windrider. During his time at the Academy, Foslo was ranked near top of his class, showing an excellence in mechanical expertise. However, he usually fell short of ranking higher in class exercises to Kyrell and another classmate, Ciena Ree, much to his chagrin.
            After graduating from the Academy in the weeks prior to the Battle of Yavin, Foslo became a top weapons expert for the Empire. Following the Battle of Jakku, he designed newer weapons systems that were refitted into the Imperial Navy's TIE fighters making them much more powerful than ever before.
            Ved Foslo was the son of the Imperial General Foslo, who worked in central intelligence. When he was around sixteen years old, the younger Foslo became an Imperial cadet at the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant, which was regarded as the most prestigious Imperial Academy in the Galactic Empire. When the Jelucani cadet Thane Kyrell rang the door chime outside their dormitory unit, Foslo chided him for ringing the chime to his own quarters. While Foslo was cold towards the newcomer, his Alderaanian room-mate Nash Windrider was friendly towards Thane.[1]
            During his time at the Royal Imperial Academy, Ved took notice of the close friendship between Thane and his fellow Jelucani Ciena Ree. Jealous of the two cadet's high marks, Foslo once taunted Thane for allowing Ciena to claim the top spot in the flying class. When Thane responded that there was room for more than one of them in the graduation class and reminded him that the Empire wanted to create the best officers, Ved responded that one day he would understand. Nash then pointed out that Foslo was jealous of Thane and Ciena's higher marks and mockingly asked Foslo about his father's rank.[1]
            Later, Foslo attended a Small Craft Flight class which involved the cadets riding speeder bikes through Reitgen Hoops. When Ciena and Thane managed to win the race despite their speeder bikes being stuck together, Foslo threw his helmet down in disgust while the other cadets cheered. Due to Foslo's antagonism, Thane and Ciena initially believed that he had been the one who sabotaged Ciena's laser cannon assignment. In truth, the sabotage had been perpetrated by the Academy's Office of Student Outcomes, which wanted to discourage local loyalties among the student population.[1]
            Prior to graduation, Foslo along with Thane, Ciena, and Jude Edivon were among a select group of Imperial cadets invited to attend a ball at the Imperial Palace, the residence of Emperor Palpatine and the former Jedi Temple. During the function, Foslo took the opportunity to wear the latest Coruscant fashion: a long cape, wide silky shirt, and other accessories. At the ball, Foslo mocked Thane and Ciena for letting their relationship be affected by the laser cannon incident. He revealed that the Academy's cadets had engineered the incident in order to weaken local ties and to strengthen their commitment to the Empire. Despite Foslo's harsh tone, Thane and Ciena realized that he was right and reconciled for good.[1]
            After graduating from the Royal Imperial Academy, Ved Foslo became a weapons expert who developed new weapons for the Imperial Navy. Following the Battle of Jakku, he developed TIE fighters that were capable of punching through energy shields and starfighter hulls with a single blast. Following the Battle of Jakku, Foslo along with his former roommate Commander Nash Windrider joined the Imperial remnant that regrouped in the Queluhan Nebula for an assault on the New Republic, the successor to the Rebel Alliance.[1] At some point in his service within the Empire, Foslo piloted a TIE Advanced x1.[3]
            Ved Foslo was a male human. In his youth, he had a slim physique, black hair, and a narrow face. Foslo liked to boast of his father General Foslo's high ranking position. As a Core Worlder, Foslo looked down on people from the Outer Rim Territories such as Thane Kyrell and Ciena. According to Thane, he never relaxed and even wore his pajamas to the neck. Foslo was known for his clean habits, his lack of a snoring problem, and his knowledge of the fine points of military culture on Coruscant. Foslo was also familiar with the night clubs on Coruscant.[1]
            In his youth, Foslo liked to keep up with fashion. While Nash believed that Foslo had risen through the ranks due to his father's interference, Foslo had a technical aptitude and became a weapons expert. While Nash chafed under Foslo's adolescent arrogance, he regarded Foslo's arrogance as completely insufferable in adulthood. Still, Nash regarded Foslo as preferable to his former friend Thane Kyrell, who had joined the Rebel Alliance and New Republic.[1]
            Ved Foslo first appeared in the canon novel Lost Stars, as part of Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which was written by Claudia Gray and published in 2015. While writing the novel, Gray pictured Foslo as being portrayed by Harry Shum Jr..[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ved_Foslo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVedFoslo</string></dict>
        <key>Siadem Forte</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.157.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Siadem Forte was a male Human Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the final years of the Republic Classic era. When the Clone Wars erupted across the galaxy, Forte took up the rank of General within the Grand Army of the Republic and fought valiantly against the Separatist Droid Army. At the end of the war, the rise of the Galactic Empire and the beginning of the Galactic Empire saw Forte deemed a fugitive and on the run. In 19 BBY, Forte confronted Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader and was slain on Kashyyyk.
            Like most of his peers, Siadem Forte was most likely discovered to be Force-sensitive on his homeworld and turned over to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for training in the ways of the Force. Entering into the academy there, Forte eventually graduated and was selected by a Master for an apprenticeship. After years of study as a Padawan, Forte passed his Trials of Knighthood and was made a Knight by the Jedi High Council.[1]
            A short, thick-bodied man, Forte eventually went on to selected the Togruta Deran Nalual as his Padawan. Traveling the galaxy together, the duo was recalled to the Coruscant Temple at the outbreak of the Clone Wars where Forte accepted the rank of General within the newly created Grand Army of the Republic to combat the Confederacy of Independent Systems' Droid Army. Fighting side-by-side with clone troopers over the course of the three years of war, Forte and Nalual were caught unawares when the Republic crumbled and its Supreme Chancellor issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army, ordering them to kill their Jedi compatriots. Able to kill their clones before they were overrun, Forte issued Emergency Code Nine Thirteen from his personal Jedi beacon on Dellalt and waited in hiding for responders. When eight other Jedi arrived, Forte took the lead as he was the oldest and lead the group in the hijacking a SX troop shuttle. Fleeing the planet, the group was harried by ARC-170s and a light cruiser, which saw the death of two of the Jedi crew. Limping through space, the group met up with the Drunk Dancer and were given sanctuary by its captain, Jula Shryne.[1]
            Traveling aboard Shryne's ship, the group was eventually enlarged with the arrival of Padawan Olee Starstone and her adopted Master, Roan Shryne. After a drawn out discussion as to what to do, Starstone encouraged the Jedi to go to Kashyyyk in order to find Grand Master Yoda. After arriving and speaking with the Wookiee chieftains there, the world was attacked by Sith Lord Darth Vader, who was hunting the fugitive Jedi. Paired with Knight Iwo Kulka, Forte and the Ho'Din attacked together but were no match for Vader. After receiving a strike to the shoulder and thigh, Forte and Kulka were both decapitated by Vader as they attempted to rise to attack. While Master Shryne attempted to strike Vader down with Forte's sapphire lightsaber, the weapon did not guide its new master to victory either. While his Padawan and several other of his comrades escaped, Forte's memory was further slandered when images of his body were used as anti-Jedi propaganda on the HoloNet.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Siadem_Forte</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSiademForte</string></dict>

        <key>Flim</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.161.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Flim was a con artist who was hired by Moff Vilim Disra in 19 ABY to play the role of a resurrected Grand Admiral Thrawn. In this capacity, he—under the directions of Disra and fellow triumvirate member Grodin Tierce—successfully convinced several officials within the Imperial Starfleet to follow his authority in a plan to cause a civil war within the New Republic. While Flim pretended to be the Grand Admiral, Tierce was the military man who came up with the battle plans.
            The plan called for the exploitation of the Caamas Document Crisis in which Imperial agents spread rumors that the Bothans were guilty of the massacre on Caamas many decades prior. Though some Bothans were to blame for the Caamas incident, the rumors spread made certain that all facts were exaggerated, which prompted a military stand-down between factions within the New Republic in orbit over Bothawui.
            Flim spent hours studying Thrawn's history to learn all he could to keep the scheme intact. Even Captain Dorja of the Star Destroyer Relentless, an officer who had served under Thrawn's command, was convinced it was really Thrawn. Shortly after allying himself with Disra and Tierce, Flim revealed himself to Lando Calrissian and Diamal Senator Porolo Miatamia. After this was revealed to the Senate, turmoil ensued. Many did not believe the reports, although some, such as Han Solo and his wife, High Councilor Leia Organa Solo believed it all too well. Few Imperials were told that Thrawn had "returned". When Gilad Pellaeon heard of these rumors, he was unsure if they were true, as he had been present when Rukh had killed his mentor a decade before. Believing that Thrawn was indeed back several star systems began to join the Imperial Remnant, the first of which was the Unified Factions. Disra's plot was working, and he believed that soon the New Republic would collapse and the Empire would rise. Eventually though, the plan unraveled.
            Supreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon, on a visit to Bastion to accuse Moff Disra of treason along with other crimes against the Empire, discovered a set of datacards in the Moff's desk when left alone in his office. He decrypted these and later met with Talon Karrde, who gave him a datacard that he had been given by Jorj Car'das. Along with the ones he took from Disra, they revealed the truth about Flim and Tierce. On Karrde's ship, the Wild Karrde, he traveled to confront Flim, Disra and Tierce at Yaga Minor, where they were battling the Errant Venture. Pellaeon revealed that Flim was an impostor, that Tierce was a clone, and that Disra was indeed guilty of many crimes, including plotting to overthow the Supreme Commander and funneling of money to suit his own purposes. Tierce was killed, and Flim surrendered both himself and his "command" without a fight—indeed, he expressed relief that the affair was over.
            Flim was not a Chiss like Thrawn, but a Human or very similar Near-Human who disguised himself using blue makeup, hair dye, and glowing red contact lenses. He demonstrated to Major Tierce and Moff Disra his ability to quickly remove these lenses during a meeting on Yaga Minor.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Flim</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFlim</string></dict>
        <key>Flint</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.162.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Flint was a male Human native from Belderone who was the son of Clone Wars-era Jedi Knight Flint Torul. During the Imperial period, Flint was chosen by Darth Vader as his fourth pupil, following the destruction of his home and death of his mother, Zana. While Flint was in service as a stormtrooper, he received personal training from Vader so that he would eventually face Vader's other pupil, Lumiya, for the honor to be Vader's Shadow Hand. However, after Vader's death, the showdown took place prematurely, and resulted in Flint becoming the apprentice to the new Dark Lady of the Sith, Lumiya.
            Flint served under Lumiya as she prepared for the Nagai-Tof War and was sent to subjugate the Phelleem sector. He was also ordered to avenge Vader's death at Endor by confronting and killing the Sith Lord's own son, Luke Skywalker. Flint finally had a showdown with Skywalker on the planet of Naldar, but was unable to bring himself to overcome or kill the Jedi. In the end, his childhood friend, Barney, helped redeem Flint from the dark side of the Force, and he turned on his Imperial allies. After residing in prison for a time, Flint took to helping displaced peoples from the Galactic Civil War. This work continued until he was finally murdered by his old master Lumiya for his ultimate betrayal.
            Flint was the son of a Jedi Knight, Flint Torul[2] and a woman named Zana.[1] Flint's father was killed during the Clone Wars by General Grievous near the end of the Outer Rim Sieges.[5] Whether the Jedi knew of his son or if he was a legitimate child is unknown, but Zana was forced to raise her young son alone.[1] To support their small family, Flint had to begin work at a young age. Zana worked the evening shift as a waitress in a cantina while Flint worked in a localized Imperial factory that was specializing in the production of AT-ATs.[1]
            Although shifts at the factory were strictly enforced by the Empire, Flint constantly had his head in the clouds and dreamed of becoming a Jedi Knight like his father. Zana was in constant worry that Flint might miss his shifts at the factory, but her son's skill as a landspeeder pilot made sure that he was always on time. Flint's idealism also got on the nerves of his best friend Barney. While Flint became excited at any change of scenery, even the occasional spacecraft that landed in the Belderone spaceport, Barney always had to be dragged along, not sharing the enthusiasm that Flint possessed.[1]
            During the height of the Galactic Civil War, the rebel heroes Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Lando Calrissian, and Chewbacca arrived on Belderone in the Millennium Falcon. As was their custom, Flint and Barney went to see the craft's arrival. Flint became ecstatic when he saw that Skywalker had a lightsaber clipped to his belt. Although Flint was sure that Skywalker and he had something in common with both of their fathers being Jedi, Skywalker denied it, in part because he had just recently discovered his father's true identity as Darth Vader.[1]
            Although Skywalker refused to acknowledge that he was a Jedi, Flint was confident that Skywalker would be the one to teach him to use the Force, and he led the rebels into the main city. Flint continued to follow Skywalker around, trying to work up the courage to ask the Jedi to train him. As Barney and Flint tried to casually spy on Skywalker a trio of Imperial assassins attempted to eliminate the rebel crew. The two friends watched as Skywalker's skills helped him easily eliminate the threat.[1]
            Now confident that Skywalker was a Jedi, Flint decided to show the rebels the AT-AT factory on the world, knowing that they would want to eliminate it to weaken the Imperials' hold on the planet. However, when the group finally arrived at the factory they found it swarming with troops, including several active AT-ATs that were making their way towards Flint's hometown. As the rebels signaled their allies to attack the monstrous machines, Flint and Barney jumped in a landspeeder and sped towards town in hopes of warning the general populace, especially Flint's unaware mother. Unfortunately, Flint's piloting skills failed him and he crashed the craft just on the outskirts of the city. Flint and Barney were both knocked unconscious.[1]
            Waking up the next morning, Flint found Barney still unconscious and believed him to be dead. One of the AT-ATs had managed to escape the rebel assault and had destroyed Flint's town. As Flint looked at his destroyed home, he realized that he had not been able to warn his mother in time, and sprinted into the city. Seeing his mother's cantina completely destroyed, he expected the worst. Among the wreckage Flint found his mother's lifeless body and broke down into a state of despair. He had not known how serious the situation was and blamed the rebels for allowing him to believe that he could make a difference.[1]
            Flint promised himself that he would become someone who mattered, someone who would show everyone that he was not worthless. As Flint spoke his promises out loud, Darth Vader arrived and recognized the power within Flint. He told the young man that he could make Flint someone of great importance and offered him a place by his side. Flint happily agreed and decided to join the Empire. Vader immediately made Flint into one of his many stormtroopers, promising that in time he would train him to use the Force.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Flint</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFlint</string></dict>

        <key>Finn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.164.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Finn, also known as FN-2187 or Eight-Seven, was a human male stormtrooper who deserted the First Order and joined the Resistance during the new galactic war. He was born in 11 ABY and, like other troopers, conscripted into the First Order military. Though a capable soldier, he lacked the zeal for combat possessed by other members of the FN Corps. During the waning days of the cold war, FN-2187 witnessed the massacre of an entire village on the desert planet Jakku—an act carried out by his squadmates on the orders of the fallen Jedi Kylo Ren. Unable to reconcile the First Order's methods with his conscience, FN-2187 escaped from his former comrades with the help of Commander Poe Dameron, a Resistance pilot who named the stormtrooper "Finn." He planned to hide in the Outer Rim Territories, believing the First Order was unbeatable, but reluctantly became involved with Rey, Han Solo, and Chewbacca as they made their way to the Resistance base on D'Qar in order to bring the droid BB-8 to General Leia Organa. After Rey was captured by Ren on Takodana, Finn infiltrated Starkiller Base to rescue his newfound friend but was subsequently defeated in a lightsaber duel with Ren.
            Although Finn recovered from his injuries, he was convinced that the Resistance fleet would be destroyed by the First Order. His second attempt at desertion was thwarted, however, by Rose Tico. As a result, Finn participated in an unsanctioned mission on Canto Bight where he and Tico recruited the codebreaker known as "DJ." They managed to infiltrate Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship, the Supremacy, but were apprehended by Captain Phasma's troops before the team could disable the vessel's hyperspace tracker. After escaping from the Dreadnought, Finn, Tico and BB-8 regrouped with their allies on Crait where the Resistance was all but destroyed by the First Order. However, Finn was among a handful of survivors who fled the battle with Rey's help.
            The boy who would become Finn was taken as a child from his family to serve the First Order. Finn later reflected that he had been too young to even remember who his family was. The child received the designation FN-2187 and was made a stormtrooper of the First Order, a military junta that continued the ideals of the fallen Galactic Empire in the decades after the Galactic Civil War. FN-2187 served under Captain Phasma as a cadet, alongside fellow troopers FN-2199 ("Nines"), FN-2000 ("Zeroes"), and FN-2003 ("Slip"). FN-2187, known to his fellow troopers as Eight-Seven, was seen by his comrades and superiors as an ideal First Order stormtrooper, and consistently scored top marks as a cadet.[5] Finn was also once in charge of sanitation duties at Starkiller Base.[5]
            Following this aboard the Finalizer, groups of stormtroopers went on Atmospheric Assault Landers to investigate GUHL-JO387O a planet in the Outer Rim Territories. GUHL-JO3870 was known to be muddy and FN-2187 complained about scrubbing assault landers. While scrubbing the assault landers, a creature from the surface of GUHL-JO387O, came aboard one of the assault landers. Finn chased the creature all around the Finalizer, preventing its discovery even as it disrupted a formal meeting with Kylo Ren, General Armitage Hux and other First Order officers. FN-2187 later went to the length of impersonating Captain Phasma in order to fool Kylo Ren in the process of tracking the creature in Phasma's quarters. He would later finally get a chance to release back on GUHL-JO387O.[7]
            Sometime after, FN-2187 and a group of stormtroopers were deployed on a jungle planet. While patrolling, a Kowakian monkey-lizard got on Eight-Seven's shoulders and pulled off his helmet, which made Eight-Seven lose the grip on his blaster and the other stormtroopers from the squad look at him. The monkey-lizard laughed furiously from the prank he made, while Eight-Seven looked uncomfortable. At some point later C-3PO told this story to some visitors and described it as "comical."[8]
            While 2187 was stationed aboard the Finalizer, his destroyer occasionally docked with the First Order's massive spacefaring capital the Supremacy. While aboard the Supremacy after his defection, Finn would feel guilty that he was unable to tell the Resistance that the First Order possessed a ship with capabilities as deadly as the Supremacy's. While serving the First Order, FN-2187 was selected a few times for executioner duty, and hoped he would never be ordered to carry out any executions.[9]
            During his time as a cadet, Eight-Seven and his fellow troopers underwent a training simulation in which they assaulted a New Republic bunker, with the intention of destroying a heavy repeating blaster manned by Republic soldiers. During their advance on the bunker, Slip fell behind—a common occurrence—and Eight-Seven intended to rescue him. Over the objections of Zeroes and Nines, who wanted to complete their objective and felt that rescuing Slip would lead the Republic to take them all out, Eight-Seven ordered them to rescue their fellow soldier. Eight-Seven sent Zeroes and Nines in different directions in order to divide the Republic's attention, while Eight-Seven himself went for Slip and successfully rescued him. Though Zeroes and Nines were pinned down, their diversion gave Eight-Seven a clear path into the Republic bunker, into which he threw a grenade and destroyed the blaster before the Republic could react to his attack.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Finn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFinn</string></dict>
        <key>Feemor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.165.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Feemor was a Human male Jedi Knight who served the Galactic Republic. The first Padawan to Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn, Feemor was successfully trained to Knighthood by Jinn, who was in turn granted the title of Jedi Master. Jinn later took a young boy named Xanatos as his second student, but the latter turned against his Master. Jinn's failure as Xanatos's teacher prompted him to dismiss his previous success with Feemor's training.
            The son of a farmer, the Human male Force-sensitive Feemor was chosen to be trained as a Jedi. Feemor was taken as[1] the first apprentice of Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn[2] at some point after Jinn brought a young boy named Xanatos to the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant.[3] Under Jinn's guidance, Feemor successfully became a Jedi Knight. His Knighthood also saw Jinn promoted to the rank of Jedi Master. Jinn then took Xanatos as his second student.[2]
            In 53 BBY, Feemor participated in a training lightsaber duel against Jinn and Xanatos at the heart of the Jedi Temple. Feemor and Xanatos both attacked Jinn with their lightsabers, but he repelled all of their attacks with ease. As the fight continued, Jinn and Xanatos locked their lightsabers, and the latter told Feemor to attack Jinn from the Master's left side. Jinn used the Force to throw Feemor to the ground, but in doing so Jinn loosened the grip on his lightsaber, allowing Xanatos to knock the lightsaber out of Jinn's hands and win the fight. As such, Xanatos merely used Feemor to achieve victory for himself.[1]
            Xanatos boasted on his victory, priding in his noble ancestry, and Jinn had to reprimand his apprentice for such behavior. Jinn then spoke to Feemor, telling his former student that he was proud of his skills, after which Feemor left the site of the duel. Immediately thereafter, Jinn and Xanatos were assigned to quell a civil war on Xanatos's homeworld of Telos IV.[1] However, during the mission, Xanatos was corrupted by wealth and power and rebelled against his Master, abandoning the Jedi way. Jinn's failure with Xanatos prompted him to dismiss his earlier success as Feemor's teacher, and he began to refer to Xanatos as his first Padawan.[4]
            After he became a Jedi Knight, Feemor came to miss his training with his Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. Feemor was visibly hurt when Xanatos admitted that he had used Feemor, stating that the latter had been destined to lose the training fight due to his humble origins. Feemor had blond hair, blue eyes and a fair skin complexion.[1]
            Feemor was unable to defeat his former Master in battle, as Qui-Gon Jinn easily repulsed him with the Force several times. However, Jinn was proud of Feemor's skills and believed that his speed of attacks had improved since their last training. Jinn felt that Feemor was ready to take a Padawan of his own and believed that Grand Master Yoda would soon assign him one. Jinn also believed that said student would be lucky to have Feemor as his Master. Feemor wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber in battle.[1]
            For many years since the introduction of Qui-Gon Jinn in the novelization of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace and the exploration of his early life in subsequent Expanded Universe material, there existed a discrepancy regarding the number of apprentices whom Jinn had during his life. Although most sources detailing Jinn's early life—such as the Jedi Apprentice book series by Jude Watson—stated that Xanatos was Jinn's first apprentice and Obi-Wan Kenobi his second,[5] Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary included a passing mention of another apprentice before Xanatos.[2] Authors Daniel Wallace and Haden Blackman planned to elaborate upon this apprentice in The Essential Guide to Episode I. Blackman developed a female Cathar Jedi for the role of Jinn's Padawan, but The Essential Guide to Episode I was cancelled, and Lucasfilm Ltd. decided that The Visual Dictionary had been in error regarding the existence of the first apprentice.[6]
            In 2002, The New Essential Guide to Characters reiterated this position by stating that Xanatos was Jinn's first apprentice.[7] However, the thirty-fifth issue of The Official Star Wars Fact File once again included the mention of the apprentice before Xanatos.[8] The contradiction was finally resolved in Jinn's Databank entry on StarWars.com, which stated that Jinn dismissed his success in training the first apprentice after his failure with Xanatos.[4] In 2011, the comic book Jedi—The Dark Side 1 featured a scene of a Jedi Knight named Feemor practicing combat against Jinn and Xanatos. Subsequent dialogue in the comic implied that Feemor had once trained under Jinn.[1] The comic's writer, Scott Allie, later confirmed via Twitter that Feemor was Jinn's first apprentice, finally establishing the Padawan's identity almost twelve years after his offhand mention in The Visual Dictionary.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Feemor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFeemor</string></dict>
        <key>Jango Fett</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.166.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jango Fett was a human male bounty hunter, widely regarded to be the best in the galaxy in the years preceding the Clone Wars. Although Fett wore a set of Mandalorian armor during his time as a bounty hunter, the government of Mandalore regarded him as a renegade and pretender. Recruited by the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, Fett was relocated to the remote planet of Kamino where he served as the genetic template of the clone troopers for the Grand Army of the Republic. Unlike Fett, his clones lacked much of his independence, as they were designed to be entirely loyal to the Galactic Republic. Fett had only one request for the Kaminoans: the creation of Boba Fett, an unaltered clone whom he would raise as his own "son."
            In the days prior to the Battle of Geonosis, Fett was involved in the Separatist assassination attempts against Senator Padmé Amidala in 22 BBY. As a result, the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi conducted an investigation into the matter, leading him to the Kaminoan homeworld while in pursuit of Amidala's would-be assassin. Fett fled from Kamino in his personal starship, Slave I, and joined Count Dooku, Tyranus' public persona and the Separatist Head of State, on Geonosis. During the ensuing battle between a Jedi assault team and the Separatist Droid Army in the Petranaki arena, Fett was killed by decapitation at the hands of Jedi Master Mace Windu. Shortly after Fett's death, the clone army arrived and, under the Jedi Order's leadership, secured the first victory in the Clone Wars.
            Fett's death instilled a desire for revenge in Boba, who initially pursued a vendetta against Windu before ultimately concentrating on his career as an aspiring bounty hunter. In time Boba was regarded as one of the deadliest mercenaries in galactic history, like his "father" before him. His legacy was also preserved in the millions of clones created from his genetic code. Compelled by their programming to execute Order 66 against the Jedi, the clone troopers revealed themselves as the secret weapon of the Sith, allowing Darth Sidious to proclaim himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire. Fett's progeny served as the first generation of stormtroopers; however, the ranks were soon filled not by clones but human recruits and conscripts.
            Jango Fett was born in the years prior to the Invasion of Naboo.[1] He claimed to have been born on the planet Concord Dawn,[2] a Mandalorian world,[8] but the exact authenticity of this claim was unknown. He wore Mandalorian armor after becoming a bounty hunter and assassin for hire,[1] a fact that led officials of Mandalore to disavow any connection to Fett, claiming he was simply a bounty hunter who somehow stole an artifact from their planet's troubled past.[9]
            In the years before the Clone Wars, on the moons of Bogden, Fett was recruited by the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus (publicly known as Count Dooku of Serenno) to be the genetic template for the clone army created by the cloners of the planet Kamino. Fett agreed and, in addition to his fee of twenty million credits,[10] also requested an unaltered clone for himself, one who was not subjected to the typical growth acceleration and behavioral modifications given to the clones. Fett raised this clone as his son, whom he named Boba Fett,[4] and remained on Kamino to supervise the flash-training of the clone troopers.[10] Despite providing the genetic template for and overseeing the training of the clones, Fett felt no particular pride in them and viewed them as the Kaminoans' achievement. He continued to take jobs as a bounty hunter, which confused the bounty hunter Neelda, as he had heard Fett had a job with a mysterious client.[11] Jango Fett was also an associate of pirate captain, Hondo Ohnaka, and fellow bounty hunter, Aurra Sing.[12]
            At some point during Boba's childhood, Fett brought him along on a mission to retrieve a Twi'lek girl who had run away from home with her Falleen lover Griph. Fett and his son traveled to Telerath where they met with the team of bounty hunters they would be completing the mission with, a Rodian named Neelda, a Gand named Rinn, and a Chadra-Fan named Tiver. The three bounty hunters agreed to let Fett bring Boba along on the mission, and the group departed for Ord Mantell.[11]
            During the flight from Telerath to Ord Mantell, Boba complained to Fett about having to work with the three bounty hunters, asking why they could not work with bounty hunters like Cad Bane, Zam Wesell, or Aurra Sing instead. Fett explained to his son that the point of the mission was to teach Boba about adapting to unknown conditions, hence working with bounty hunters Boba did not know.[11]
            On Ord Mantell, Fett and his team quickly tracked the Twi'lek and Griph to a bar where the two were discussing their plan to join Black Sun. While Boba and the trio of hunters cornered the lovers on the bar's balcony, Fett waited below in case his hunch was correct that the Twi'lek girl would jump. When she fell from the balcony, Fett caught and stunned her. Fett then brought her unconscious body to Slave I in order to bring her back to her father.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jango_Fett</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJangoFett</string></dict>
        <key>Boba Fett</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.167.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Boba Fett was a Mandalorian warrior and bounty hunter. He was the only unaltered clone of the famed Jango Fett, created in 32 BBY as unit A0050, one of the first of many Fett replicas designed to become part of the Grand Army of the Republic, and was raised as Jango's son. Jango taught Boba much, training him to become a skilled bounty hunter as was his father-figure before him. In 22 BBY, Jango was killed at the Battle of Geonosis, which opened the Clone Wars. Just a boy, Boba was forced to grow up and took to traveling the galaxy. Later, he became a bounty hunter and took assignments from beings such as Jabba the Hutt, and achieved notoriety despite his young age.
            When the Empire was formed in 19 BBY, it was the perfect environment for Fett. During this time, he also married Sintas Vel and had a daughter named Ailyn Vel. Fett became known as the galaxy's best bounty hunter of the next several decades, often working for the Empire. He collaborated with Darth Vader on several occasions, and the Sith Lord even developed a grudging respect for Fett.
            In 1 BBY, a year after the Galactic Civil War had begun, Fett was hired to kidnap the Rebel captain Juno Eclipse in order to lure out a clone of Galen Marek. Fett also participated in the Battle of Kamino. When Darth Vader was captured and about to be interrogated on Dantooine, the Mandalorian bounty hunter trailed the Rogue Shadow there.
            Fett made his most notable bounty in 3 ABY, when he captured Rebel hero Han Solo, and delivered him to Jabba the Hutt. A year later, during the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon, Fett fought against the group of Rebel rescuers. He was inadvertently knocked into the mouth of the Sarlacc by Solo. Though no one in recorded history had ever escaped from the Sarlacc, Fett was able to escape, though not unscathed. Thanks to his iron will and Mandalorian armor, he was able to fight his way out of the beast's belly. Back in action, he resumed his work as a bounty hunter.
            After a promise made to a dying Fenn Shysa, Fett became Mandalore and eventually led the Mandalorians through the Yuuzhan Vong War. Originally working as a mercenary for the extra-galactic invaders, Fett later aided the New Republic in their battle against the aliens. When the Yuuzhan Vong assaulted Mandalore and bombarded the planet's surface, a large deposit of Mandalorian iron was unearthed, ironically helping to strengthen the Mandalorians.
            Later, during the Second Galactic Civil War, Boba, who was still leading the Mandalorians, was plagued by ailing health. He found his granddaughter, Mirta Gev, and the two went on many missions together, even alongside Han Solo. Fett also trained Solo's daughter Jaina to kill her twin brother, Darth Caedus, and assisted the Jedi Coalition in several battles. Ultimately, Fett's training helped Jaina bring down Caedus, though an Imperial nanovirus attack prevented Fett from ever returning to Mandalore.
            Boba was created by Kaminoans as an unaltered clone, at the request of his father, Jango Fett, before the start of the Clone Wars. He was intended to be both Jango's heir and "Jaster's legacy." As a young boy, Fett grew up on the planet Kamino. Jango raised and cared for him with the assistance of the Kaminoan, Taun We, who ultimately took on the role of being a foster mother to him. Fett was aware of the fact that he was a clone of his father, however, he would often question his conception. Jango assured his son that he was a "true clone" and his real son. Along with the Clawdite Zam Wesell, Taun We was the sole female influence in the young Fett's life. He was known to the Null-ARC Captain Ordo as a "little jerk".
            As a child Boba never attended school at all; instead he gained much knowledge from his travels with his father and the books he borrowed from the local library. Boba was very fond of books, especially those about starfighters, which he often borrowed and read from the library of Tipoca City. Sometime before the Clone Wars, Boba met Sith Lord Count Dooku (Darth Tyranus), who had hired his father to take up bounties that would be beneficial to him and his master in the events that followed. On one such mission Boba accompanied Jango to the planet of Kuat, where Jango used the boy as bait to lure his bounty into the open. Afraid, the young Fett threw a thermal detonator and fled into the tents. Once he located the boy, the colonist was horrified to learn the young boy was the son of the man sent to kill him. Jango, having finished assassinating the remaining members of the camp, tracked down Boba and demanded that Larbo release his son, slashing his way through the tent's canopy. Disgusted, Larbo asked what kind of man would use his own son as bait, and Boba replied, "Only a son can know his father's heart". After killing his bounty, Boba escaped with his father on their ship and informed the Count of their successful mission. Boba would often accompany his father to the training sessions with the other clones where he taught them basic combat skills.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Boba_Fett/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBobaFett</string></dict>
        <key>Niles Ferrier</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.168.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Niles Ferrier was a Human male ship thief who in 9 ABY worked as an agent for Grand Admiral Thrawn during his campaign to conquer the galaxy, helping with efforts to find the Katana fleet and trying to undermine the embryonic Smugglers' Alliance. He was known for his habitual use of cigarras.
            Around 1 BBY, Ferrier encountered Lando Calrissian on Phraetiss.
            When Grand Admiral Thrawn put out the word among fringe groups that the Galactic Empire would pay well for warships, Ferrier, a competent ship-thief, tried to answer the call by stealing ships from the New Republic Defense Fleet at the Sluis Van shipyard. He was deflected from this course of action by Calrissian who suggested that Ferrier try his luck at the Cavrilhu Pirates' base on Amorris. Ferrier successfully stole three Sienar patrol ships from the pirates and took them to the Empire.
            After searching for more warships he succeeded in delivering Captain Hoffner, who knew where the Katana fleet rested, to Thrawn. Nonetheless, his stupidity tried Thrawn's patience on many occasions, most notably when Ferrier bribed an Imperial lieutenant to attack a smuggler's meeting.[1] The assault backfired, resulting in the very Smuggler's Alliance that Thrawn was trying to prevent.
            Threatened by Thrawn, Ferrier attended the smuggler's meeting on Hijarna where his wraith held the rest of the smuggling leaders hostage while Ferrier tried to frame Talon Karrde for the Imperial attack on the smugglers at their first meeting. When that failed because of a careless choice of words, Ferrier attempted to escape in his modified Corellian gunship, only to be destroyed in mid-flight by Mazzic's Preybird fighters.
            Niles' presence was almost always easily detectable due to his frequent and constant use of cigarras, which gave him a unique, easily-recognizable scent in crowds. This allowed Luke Skywalker to find him using Force smell. Niles Ferrier made one very significant, though unintentional, contribution to the efforts of the New Republic. During the beginning of the Thrawn campaign, the New Republic leadership learned that a tactical genius, possibly a Grand Admiral, had assumed command of the remnants of the Imperial Fleet. Despite access to volumes of Imperial records and contacts such as information brokers, the New Republic was unable to learn the identity of the mystery Grand Admiral. It wasn't until Niles Ferrier confronted Han Solo and Lando Calrissian about the hunt for the Katana Fleet that he let Thrawn's name slip.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Niles_Ferrier</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNilesFerrier</string></dict>

Following a conspiracy against Darth Vader, Ferro, along with four other officers, were killed, with Vader stating that although he had suspicions on the conspirators, he would always survive.
            Corin Ferro was an human male who served as an Imperial officer in the Imperial Officer Corps. Following an attempted assassination on Darth Vader on Cabarria by bounty hunters, Vader ordered his droid to conduct an analysis of the origins of the kill contract as they were arriving on Coruscant. The droid stated that the contract came from the highest levels of the Imperial Executive Building, including the offices of Emperor Palpatine. The droid continued, and stated that there was a 97% probability that the signal originated from there, and that there was no evidence of slicing.[1]
            Vader then requested a list of individuals with access codes of Imperial systems that were above Level 1A1. On the list provided, Ferro's name was indexed there, along with the names of Joon Strephi, Wilhuff Tarkin, Cassio Tagge, Jer Croteau, Tomas Azoras, and Zorta Bingan. Following a second assassination attempt in Coruscant's orbit that resulted in Vader and the Ninth Sister crashing their starship, Vader met with the Emperor and meditated and discovered that Barokki was also involved, an officer he had force choked some time before, and he later approached the Emperor with a solution.[1]
            Ferro, along with many other officers, were called into an auditorium on Coruscant. Vader believed that the conspiracy against him was because the officers did not understand why Vader was Emperor Palpatine's second in command and were likely jealous. Following a brief speech by Emperor Palpatine that elaborated that Vader was his direct subordinate and spoke and command for him, Vader "randomly" selected Ferro, Strephi, Azoras, Barokki, and Bingan and killed them through the Force, and stated that although he had suspicions on the conspirators, he would always survive. Of those killed, Barokki was one of two officers that were involved in the conspiracy, the other, who was an individual with two missing fingers was not selected and thus spared.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Corin_Ferro</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCorinFerro</string></dict>

When the Rakata attacked the Tythan system in what came to be known as the Force Wars, Fenn served as a general and fought to prevent the Empire from taking control of the Settled Worlds.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Jake Fenn was trained in the ways of the Force by the Je'daii Order on the planet Tython, one of nine planets in the Tython system which made up the Settled Worlds. Born into a family strong in the Force, Fenn's sister Rori was a Je'daii Ranger.[4] Appointed as a Je'daii Temple Master sometime prior to 25,808 BBY,[5] Fenn governed the Great Temple of the Arts, Bodhi. Carrying a single Force-imbued blade, Fenn and the other Temple Masters formed the Je'daii Council, meeting via holocommunication at the Temple of Balance, Akar Kesh.[2]
            A friend of Je'daii Master Brock, Brock's son Dalien suspected the Temple Master praised his work only due to his respect for his father.[5] In 25,793 BBY Fenn communicated with the rest of the Masters' Council when the Devourer crashed on Tython, causing a massive and devastating Force Storm.[2] Joining the other Temple Masters in meditation, Fenn and his colleagues helped to disperse the Force Storm and prevent it from completely devastating the planet.[3] Later, following the escape of the Force Hound Xesh and exiled Je'daii Daegen Lok from the moon of Bogan, Fenn and his sister led a team of Je'daii in pursuit of the pair. Flying two Peacemaker-class cruisers in chase, Fenn and his team of Je'daii including Journeyer Sek'nos Rath and Ranger Bel Zana investigated the cells on Bogan only to discover it filled with terenta.[4] Tracking him to Krev Coeur, Fenn and his fellow Je'daii engaged the pair within the crystal mines. Dueling with Lok, Fenn remarked on Lok's arrogance before the exile slashed him across the chest. Seeking out Fenn's darkest fear, Lok realized that Fenn cared for Ranger Zana and used the Force to toss her over the cliff and twisting her mind to make her think she was on fire. As Lok and Xesh fled, Rath sacrificed himself to save Zana so that Fenn could rush her to a medical facility. Rushing her to Kalimahr, Fenn contacted the other Je'daii to let them know of Zana's condition and the fact Rath may be dead.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jake_Fenn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJakeFenn</string></dict>
        <key>Roan Fel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.172.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Roan Fel was a Human male who served as the third Emperor of the Fel dynasty to rule the Fel Empire, and later the first ruler of the new Empire. Roan was the grandson of Jaina and Jagged Fel, the head of the Moff Council following the Second Galactic Civil War. He was also an Imperial Knight, part of a Force-sensitive organization that rejected the dark side.
            Following the Sith–Imperial War, he took control of the Fel Empire on Coruscant; however, he was soon deposed by Darth Krayt, who founded his own Sith Empire on Coruscant. Fel took control of the loyalist world of Bastion seven years later, and in the Second Imperial Civil War, he led other loyalists as the head of the Empire-in-exile, which opposed Krayt's rule. Fel talked of an alliance with Gar Stazi, the leader of the Galactic Alliance Remnant, as well as the fugitive members of the New Jedi Order. However, during the final battle above Coruscant, Fel gave into the dark side when he attempted to use a Sith bioweapon to kill all life on the planet, forcing Antares Draco to kill him. In the wake of the allies' subsequent victory over the Sith, Fel was later mourned during a solemn ceremony on the reclaimed Coruscant. However, the details of his death were covered up for political reasons.
            Roan Fel was the grandson of Jaina and Jagged Fel,[4] who led the Imperial Remnant's Moff Council in the time following the Second Galactic Civil War. During his youth, the heir of the resurrected Galactic Empire was trained as an Imperial Knight under his father's rule alongside fellow apprentice Treis Sinde. The two developed a close friendship, and Fel was known to rely greatly on Sinde's advice and wisdom. After his training ended and his father's death, Fel became Emperor and started to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather by continuing the Victory Without War program. A capable politician and a skilled military leader, Fel didn't underestimate the ambitions of the Moff Council and continuously played them against each other to maintain his base of power.
            At some point during his reign, Fel married a Hapan woman named Elliah and he fathered a daughter, Marasiah. However, Elliah was at some point killed by Eshkar Niin, one of Fel's Imperial Knights and the only knight to turn his back on his vows. Antares Draco, who had studied under both Niin and Fel, had attempted to stop his former master, and struck him down when he failed. Niin, however, had actually faked defeat and fled to join the One Sith. Fel eventually made Draco second-in-command of the Imperial Knights.
            Sometime before 127 ABY, the Galactic Alliance agreed to the Ossus Project, an attempt by the New Jedi Order to use Yuuzhan Vong terraforming technology to undo damage the Yuuzhan Vong had done to a number of worlds during their war with the galaxy. At first, the project was going smoothly. But it was soon sabotaged by the new Sith Order. Not knowing this, many people cast the blame on the Vong, believing them to be renewing their crusade against the galaxy. The Alliance, at the Jedi's urging, defended the Vong, which caused many Alliance worlds to stop supporting it. Fel met with Jedi Master Kol Skywalker and promised to stay the Empire's hand while Skywalker tried to prove that the project was sabotaged. But the Moff Council, seeing the opportunity to re-establish Imperial control over the galaxy, invoked the Treaty of Anaxes and declared war on a weakened Galactic Alliance.
            Roan Fel, unable to ignore the Moff Council's power to declare war, reluctantly went to war with the support of the new Sith Order. Unlike Darth Krayt and some on the Moff Council, the Emperor did not view the war as the means to achieve a grand ideological agenda. Rather, he saw it as an unfortunate political necessity, the best course of action for the Empire in a troubled galaxy. Though allied with the Sith, Fel had no desire to see the Jedi exterminated. He even forbade his Imperial Knights from fighting in the war.
            Three years later, the war was over. The Alliance fell with the defeat at Caamas and the conquest of Coruscant. It was only as the war was winding down that he realized that the Empire had been manipulated into the war by the new Sith Order and their ally on the Moff Council, Nyna Calixte. When the war ended, Fel asked the Jedi to surrender, and some of them did, but the majority of the Order refused. Fel ordered that the Jedi be allowed to return to Ossus, and called for a diplomatic mission once they had done so. But Moff Rulf Yage and Darth Nihl undermined his orders and attacked the Temple. The Massacre at Ossus, as it came to be known, wiped out half of the Jedi Order.
            Fel seemed to have realized at some point that Darth Krayt and Grand Admiral Morlish Veed were plotting betrayal and, sometime after the war ended, made plans to arrest Veed. It was after this that Calixte approached Fel and told him about Krayt's intention to assassinate him at an upcoming meeting and advised him to escape. Fel realized that Calixte was telling the truth because if he died, Calixte would be useless to the Sith and would also die. So he arranged for a double to appear at the meeting instead of him. All while this was happening, he and Antares made their way through the sewers, slashing through droids before escaping. Fel escaped to plot his retaliation against Krayt and the Empire he had seized control of.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Roan_Fel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRoanFel</string></dict>
        <key>Jagged Fel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.173.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jagged Fel, known as Jag to his friends, was a male Human ace pilot who, much like his father, General Baron Soontir Fel, was dedicated to a life of military service and later became the Head of State of the Imperial Remnant. Raised by his father and mother, Syal Antilles Fel, Jagged Fel was raised in the Unknown Regions among the strict and dutiful Chiss of the Empire of the Hand. Fel entered a Chiss military academy in his very early teens. By age eighteen, had attained the rank of colonel and commanded of three squadrons of Clawcraft. At that same age, he had also lost two of his five siblings to battle against the myriad threats of the Unknown Regions. When the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, Fel's father sent him to aid the New Republic in holding them back. Fel served at the Battle of Ithor, where he made the acquaintance of a young pilot named Jaina Solo and met his uncle, Wedge Antilles, for the first time.
            Fel was recalled to the Unknown Regions some time after the battle, but returned after the fall of Coruscant to the Yuuzhan Vong. He helped Solo defend Hapes against a Yuuzhan Vong fleet before serving under his uncle in the defense of Borleias, where he began a romance with Solo which would grow intense as the war went on. Fel continued serving alongside her throughout the war and flew in the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, which gave the newly formed Galactic Federation of Free Alliances victory in the long war. His romance with Solo did not survive the war's aftermath as she drew away from all others and Fel was recalled to Csilla in the Chiss Ascendancy, where he eventually gained a captaincy in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force.
            Fel led the Chiss war against the Killik colonies, in which he was pitted against Jaina Solo. During the final battle of that conflict, Solo's mother shot him down when the Jedi attempted to stop the Chiss from unleashing a genocidal weapon against the Killiks. Fel spent two years marooned in the deadly jungles of Tenupe before he was rescued. During the war, he had guaranteed the parole of Lowbacca, a Jedi Knight who later returned to combat against the Chiss. This made Fel and his family responsible for all Lowbacca's damages, and when they could not pay, Fel was permanently exiled from the Chiss. He began tracking the last member of the Killik's Dark Nest, Alema Rar, and eventually gained Jedi support for his mission, tracking the Dark Jedi Rar in an uneasy partnership with Solo and her close friend Zekk. At long last, Fel personally killed Rar and in so doing restored his family's honor.
            At the close of the Second Galactic Civil War, Fel aided the Jedi in defeating Darth Caedus. During peace negotiations, Luke Skywalker forced the Moff Council of the Imperial Remnant to accept Fel as the Remnant's Head of State so that he could keep tight control of the devious Moffs and in so doing allow a stable peace settlement.
            In 44 ABY, Fel married Jaina Solo. Eventually, he became Emperor of the revived Empire, ruling as the first of the Fel dynasty.
            Jagged Fel was born in 7 ABY to General Baron Soontir Fel and Syal Antilles Fel, both Corellians, and named for his maternal grandfather, Jagged Antilles.[2][3] Soontir Fel had been a highly successful Imperial fighter pilot and Syal Antilles was a holodrama star, performing under the name Wynssa Starflare, when they married. After the Emperor's death, however, Soontir's faith in the Empire was shaken, and when the New Republic captured him, he defected and served alongside his brother-in-law Wedge Antilles in Rogue Squadron. In 5 ABY, he was captured by Imperial leader Ysanne Isard and handed over to Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo, better known as Thrawn. Thrawn had carved out the Empire of the Hand, an Imperialist domain in the Unknown Regions dedicated to holding back the various aggressive species and states within. When Thrawn explained this to him, Soontir became convinced that this was work that needed to be done, and became the commander of the Empire of the Hand's starfighter forces. Syal joined him, and so Jagged was born on Nirauan, the site of the Hand of Thrawn—the Empire of the Hand's headquarters—and raised among the Chiss, Thrawn's people.[3] Fel had two older brothers, Davin and Chak, as well as two younger sisters, Cherith and Wynssa. In addition, his younger brother Cem was raised as the family's shadow child, a Chiss tradition in which one child was kept secret in order to preserve the bloodline against assassination attempts.[15]
            Growing up, Fel idolized his eldest brother Davin, and likely Chak as well. He also looked up to Thrawn, a master tactician and strategist and the founder of the government his father served; Thrawn's name remained respected years after his death in 9 ABY leading the Empire against the New Republic.[7] The Empire of the Hand was left a secret to the wider galaxy as Soontir Fel and Empire of the Hand commander Admiral Voss Parck led campaigns against the various threats of the Unknown Regions.[16] Soontir taught his son to respect Chiss and their excellent military skills, and Fel was raised as if he were a Chiss, complete with their disdain for adolescence, moving into adulthood early. He was held to Chiss standards, one Human among the isolationist and demanding Chiss.[4][7] His father taught him to fly, to think critically and logically, and to master military tactics. Fel was raised by warriors to be a warrior.[17]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jagged_Fel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJaggedFel</string></dict>

He eventually came out of retirement and joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, teaching Rebel pilots the skills needed to fight against the Empire. Known as a top X-wing pilot, Farrell flew a modified R-22 Spearhead during the Battle of Yavin. His experience with the R-22 led to him being selected to help design the new RZ-1 A-wing interceptor, which was based on the R-22. When the first A-wings entered service, Farrell transferred to an A-wing squadron.

Participating in the starfighter attack on the Death Star's main reactor, Farrell followed the order of Gold Leader Lando Calrissian to break off his run and head for the surface of the station, drawing off some of the Imperial TIE fighters in pursuit.
            In the years prior to the declaration of a New Order, Jake Farrell, a Human male, served the Galactic Republic as a starfighter pilot.[3] When the Clone Wars ended in 19 BBY, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire with himself as Emperor[4] and Farrell went on to serve the new Imperial Navy, helping to train some of the best pilots in the Empire. However, as the Empire grew more ruthless, Farrell found himself sent on ever more destructive missions.[3] Watching the pilots he had trained help to further Palpatine's subjugation of the galaxy,[5] Farrell decided to retire, leaving the Imperial Navy and fleeing to a secret location to pass the rest of his life in peace.[3]
            Years later,[5] after the rise of the Alliance to Restore the Republic in 2 BBY,[4] Farrell came out of retirement and joined the fledgling Rebellion as an instructor in the Alliance Starfighter Corps, in the hopes of providing young pilots with the skills they would need to fight the Empire.[3] Farrell originally flew T-65 X-wing starfighters and was considered one of the Rebellion's top X-wing pilots.[6] Despite this, Farell preferred the extra speed and maneuverability of the R-22 Spearhead and spent much time upgrading the fighter to further improve its performance.[7]
            By 0 BBY,[8] Farrell held the rank of commander and was using his experience to train rookie pilots. One of his trainees was "Rookie One", who was sent to Farrell after passing his piloting trials through Beggar's Canyon on Tatooine. Flying a pair of R-22 Spearheads, Farrell led Rookie One through the Tatoo system's asteroid field, instructing him to dodge the rock asteroids and shoot any ice ones in his path. Impressed by Rookie One's performance, Farrell passed him and ordered the young pilot to report to Kolaador for the final phase of his training.[9]
            Shortly after Rookie One's training, the Empire dispatched the Death Star, a battlestation which was capable of destroying a planet, to destroy the Rebel base on Yavin 4.[9] Having managed to acquire the plans to the superweapon, General Jan Dodonna devised a plan to destroy it—a direct proton torpedo hit on a small thermal exhaust port would trigger a chain reaction in the battlestation's main reactor.[10] Farrell took a pair of modified R-22 Spearheads to Yavin 4[7] and flew one of the fighters in the subsequent Battle of Yavin. Working alongside his former pupil, Rookie One, along with numerous other Alliance starfighter pilots, Farrell helped to fight the Imperial forces[11] until Red Squadron pilot Luke Skywalker scored the decisive blow.[10]
            Following the Battle of Yavin, General Dodonna, Adar Tallon and Walex Blissex realized that the Alliance needed a faster starfighter than the X-wing to counter the latest Imperial TIE models. The resulting starfighter, the RZ-1 A-wing interceptor, was based on the R-22 Spearhead, and Farrell's experience modifying the fighters saw him recruited to help draw up the designs.[7] When the new starfighters entered service, Farrell transferred to an A-wing unit.[6]
            Four years later,[4] the Alliance learned that the Empire had constructed a second Death Star, more powerful than the first.[1] When the time came for the Rebel Alliance to attack the new battlestation, Farrell, as one of the best A-wing operators, was chosen to fly with Green Squadron[6] with the call sign Green Four.[7] In the initial stages of the battle, Green Squadron and other A-wing units used their jamming units to disrupt Imperial targeting computers.[12] As the battle progressed, Green Squadron pilots scored many kills on Imperial fighters[13] and Farrell joined Green Leader Arvel Crynyd to bring down the deflector shields protecting the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer Executor, leading to the destruction of the Imperial command ship.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jake_Farrell/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJakeFarrell</string></dict>
        <key>Temmin Wexley</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.176.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Temmin "Snap" Wexley was a human male who lived during the Age of the Empire and the time of the New Republic. At a young age, Temmin was separated from his parents after his father Brentin was taken away by the Galactic Empire and his mother Norra Wexley joined the Rebel Alliance. He became an independent businessman who specialized in junk dealing and rebuilt a B1 battle droid named Mister Bones to keep him company. Following the Battle of Endor, the teenage Wexley reconciled with his mother Norra and joined forces with her to disrupt a secret Imperial meeting on the planet Akiva.
            After the Rebellion on Akiva, Temmin joined his mother, Bones, the bounty hunter Jas Emari, the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, and the New Republic soldier Jom Barell in hunting down Imperial fugitives. Temmin also befriended Captain Wedge Antilles and began training to be a starfighter pilot. Later, Temmin and his mother's team undertook a quest to rescue the rebel leader Han Solo. During a mission on Kashyyyk, Temmin and Norra reunited with Brentin. However, the reunion was soured by the realization that Brentin had become an unwilling Imperial assassin.
            Following the attack on Chandrila, Temmin joined Norra and her team in hunting down Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, whom they mistakenly believed masterminded the attack on the New Republic leadership. Temmin later fought in the Battle of Jakku before joining the New Republic Defense Fleet as a pilot. He was later recruited into the Resistance and became a member of Black Squadron of the Resistance Starfighter Corps. Wexley later became a captain and respected recon pilot in Blue Squadron; seeing action during the Battle of Takodana and the assault on Starkiller Base.
            Temmin Wexley was born on the planet Akiva to Norra and Brentin Lore Wexley. He and his parents grew up in the city of Myrra. At an early age, Temmin was separated from his father, who was arrested by Imperial forces on the charge of carrying messages for the Rebel Alliance. When he was about twelve years old, Temmin's mother left Akiva to become a pilot in the Rebel Alliance. She left her son in the care of her sister Esmelle and Esmelle's wife Shirene.[1]
            However, Esmelle and Shirene proved unable to handle him, and he moved back to his family home to live an independent lifestyle. Despite moving out, Temmin still kept in touch with them and visited them weekly. During his visits, he often bought grocery items like fruits, bread, and meat proucts like wyrg-jerky and spicy arguez sausage. He also repaired their evaporator and flood-pump when they broke down.[1]
            Living on his own, Temmin learned to take care of himself in his adolescence, turning his parents' house into a spare-parts shop. By the age of fifteen, Temmin had become a streets art junk dealer who was involved in underworld dealings with gangsters like the Sullustan Surat Nuat. During this time, Wexley re-purposed an old B1 battle droid into an extremely efficient killing machine, appropriately naming it "Mister Bones." With the loss of his mother to the Rebellion and his father taken into Imperial custody, Temmin gained a certain hatred for both factions. While he loathed the Empire, he was also bitter towards his mother Norra for leaving him behind to join the Rebellion. Regarding himself as a businessman, Temmin refused to take any side in the Galactic Civil War.[1]
            Following the Battle of Endor, which decapitated the Empire's leadership, Temmin's mother Norra returned to Akiva to reunite with her son and take him offworld. Despite the advances made by the Rebel Alliance's successor government, the New Republic, Akiva was still occupied by an Imperial fleet. Several leading Imperial officials including Admiral Rae Sloane were convening an Imperial Future Council on the planet to discuss the future of the Empire. While playing a game of Galactic Expansion with his repurposed interrogator droid, Mister Bones informed him that he had customers.[1]
            These customers turned out to be Surat's henchmen: the Abednedo Toomata Wree, the Ithorian Herf, and the Koorivar Makarial Gravin, who had come to punish the young dealer for scavenging a black crate from one of Surat's wrecked transports which had crashed on Trabzon Road. When the gangsters demanded that he surrender his shop as compensation, Temmin unleashed Mister Bones on them. The repurposed battle droid quickly defeated them with his vibroblade. Temmin then incapacitated the intruders by having his interrogator droid inject them with a toxic narcotic. Before he could order Bones to get rid of the bodies, his mother Norra arrived.[1]
            After tearfully embracing his mother, Temmin ordered Bones to dump the gangsters in a nearby river before they could wake up. Still angry at his mother for leaving him, Temmin brushed aside her efforts to talk to him. When Norra expressed her shock at his involvement in crime and turning their family home into a junk shop, he countered that she had left him to fight in the Rebellion. He was also upset that she had not been able to find his father Brentin. Their argument was interrupted by a distress transmission from the New Republic starfighter pilot Wedge Antilles, who had been captured during a scouting mission above Akiva. Thinking that Norra was going to leave him again for another rebel mission, Temmin stormed out of the room and slammed the door shut.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Temmin_Wexley</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTemminWexley</string></dict>
        <key>Faie</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.177.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"Faie" was the nickname of a clone trooper commander who served in the Grand Army of the Republic under Jedi General Oppo Rancisis during the height of the Clone Wars.
            Commander Faie was created and trained on Kamino. One of the first hundred clone commanders put through Alpha-17's specialized training regimen, Faie's by-the-book personality often put him at odds with his Jedi superiors.
            As the Clone Wars reached its finale, Faie was chosen to lead one of three elite battalions, with the other two being led by Commanders Neyo and Bly, set aside for action on Saleucami, where they were to take out Separatist cloning facilities being used to churn out deadly Morgukai warriors. The task force was placed under the command of Jedi Generals Oppo Rancisis and Quinlan Vos. As the battle against Saleucami's Morgukai defenders raged, Republic capital ships pounded the clone facilities into dust. Their victory on Saleucami was undercut, however, with the death of General Rancisis at the hands of the Dark Jedi Sora Bulq.
            Following his success on Saleucami, Faie was once again paired with Jedi General Quinlan Vos and sent to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk as part of an elite task force helmed by Jedi Master Yoda and Commander Gree of the 41st Elite Corps.[1][2]
            When the Separatists moved against the city of Kachirho, Faie, Gree, and the Jedi were there to meet them. As the fighting for the city intensified, both Gree and Faie received Order 66 directly from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine himself.
            Acting without hesitation, Faie and his clone troops moved against Generals Vos and Unduli before they could catch wind of what was going on, though Vos escaped with his life. However, Commander Gree did not fare as well, as he was decapitated when he tried to sneak up on General Yoda. With the death of Gree, the burden of orchestrating the defense of Kashyyyk, as well as hunting down the surviving Jedi, fell upon Faie's shoulders.
            Faie's search for the fugitive Vos took him and the clone troopers of Bogey Squad deep into the heart of Kashyyyk's thick forests, where he demanded that Vos reveal himself and face justice, or Faie would call in an orbital bombardment that would destroy himself, the Jedi and a nearby village of innocent Wookiees. Enraged that the clone would deliberately endanger innocents just to fulfill one objective, Vos leapt from the trees, lightsaber at the ready. Though Faie did manage to shoot the Jedi in the chest, the shot wasn't fatal. Vos beheaded the clone commander with a single stroke of his weapon.
            Commander Faie was the ideal clone that was envisioned by the cloners on Kamino and embodied by the vast majority of the Clone Army. Unlike some of his brethren, he showed little interest in developing himself as an individual and strictly maintained himself as—what all clones were created to be—a soldier bred to fight and die for the Republic. He followed orders without question, regardless of what they were. Faie's obedience was so extreme to the point where that held little to regard for his life or that of others. For instance, he was perfectly willing to kill himself and an entire Wookiee village via orbital bombardment just to fulfill Order 66 in eliminating his former superior officer, General Vos. He disliked the Jedi Order and did not hesitate to murder Jedi Master Luminara Unduli in compliance with Order 66, shooting her in the chest before she could defend herself.
            Faie was known to wear three sets of armor during his service—a set similar to a Clone engineer, a panoply with white plates and yellow markings like those of the 327th Star Corps, and the garb of a clone scout trooper.
            Faie was named after Art Department Supervisor Fay David.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Faie</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFaie</string></dict>

        <key>Marcellin Wessel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.179.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Marcellin Wessel was a Human male who was one of the first regional governors, or Moffs, of the Galactic Empire.
            Beginning as a colonel commanding Grand Army of the Republic forces on the more remote fronts of the Clone Wars, Wessel was appointed by Palpatine under the Sector Governance Decree, which authorized the creation of regional governors to administer entire sectors. Wessel's early rise to the administration of Immalia sector hints at a history of unquestioned loyalty to Palpatine, since such appointments were made only on behalf of those who had proven their loyalty, and as moffs were intended from the start to be answerable only to the Emperor, it was crucial that they be beings who could be depended on without reserve. Shortly after the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Moff Wessel, acting at the request of Sate Pestage, submitted a report outlining the "highlights" of Order 66 to Emperor Palpatine.
            When Emperor Palpatine declared his Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, Wessel was made Grand Moff of the Immalia Oversector and assumed the role of commander of the 7th Sector Army.[1]
            It is not known exactly what happened, but evidently Moff Wessel's fortunes turned for the worse. In 3 ABY, at the height of the Galactic Civil War, he had been relegated to the governorship of Yinchorr, a dead-end position in a useless star system. Wessel decided that he could advance his career again by capturing Princess Leia Organa, and kidnapped the leaders of the Yinchorri Elders Council, offering to trade their lives back to the Yinchorri in exchange for Organa. With no choice, the Yinchorri agreed that their beloved elders were worth the life of one Human. They set a trap for Leia, but Wessel double-crossed the Yinchorri,[2] angering them sufficiently to overthrow him and his regime. However, their insurrection was swiftly crushed by the Empire, ending with the killing of the Council and destruction of Tol-Kachorn.
            These events did not, however, stop the advancement of his son, Redd, to becoming a general in the Imperial Army and eventually head of Central Command under Carnor Jax.
            Governor Wessel was created in 1983 for the Marvel comics issue The Alderaan Factor by writer Randy Stradley, currently in charge of the Star Wars comic lines for Dark Horse Comics. Like so many Imperial characters written in those days, he had no first name, and indeed it was not seen as relevant at the time. However, Daniel Wallace, included the name as a sort of easter egg in his HoloNet News article for Star Wars Insider 84. In his blog, he wrote: "'Meet Your Regional Governors' has profiles on Denn Wessex (an old WEG character from the gaming module Starfall) and Marcellin Wessel, who is intended to be the old man in charge of Yinchorr in the Marvel comic The Last Gift From Alderaan (one of the rare instances when Wallace may have been in error, as it was actually The Alderaan Factor). General Redd Wessel, who appears in Crimson Empire, would presumably be his son."[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Marcellin_Wessel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMarcellinWessel</string></dict>
        <key>Galak Fyyar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.180.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Galak Fyyar was a military scientist that served Lord Hethrir's Empire Reborn faction of the Imperial Remnant, several years after the defeat of Emperor Palpatine.
            After the height of the Galactic Civil War, Galak Fyyar left his previous position as a scientist in the Maw system to become an officer. As an ambitious officer, Fyyar rose to the rank of Admiral and had aspirations of galactic conquest, but his dependence on technology and his overconfidence were the keys to his eventual downfall. He also held the title of "Chancellor", though its significance is unclear.
            After the fall of the Empire, Fyyar fell in with former Procurator of Justice Hethrir and his Empire Reborn faction. Fyyar became one of Hethrir's top lieutenants. He worked closely with Desann, another of Hethrir's lieutenants, to develop methods of infusing non-Force-sensitives with the Force. The pair carried out their experiments on Kejim until the outpost was destroyed by Kyle Katarn. Desann and Fyyar managed to turn this to their advantage, tracking Katarn to the Valley of the Jedi.
            There, the pair put their research to use. Artusian crystals focused the Valley's power into minimally Force-sensitive recruits, creating the dark Jedi order of Reborn.
            Fyyar also created a cortosis-based armor, resistant to lightsabers. Fyyar himself had a special powered armor suit equipped with a rocket launcher, a shield generator, and a heavy repeater.
            Lighter cortosis armor, equipped with a focusing Artusian crystal, was issued to the shadowtroopers, who served as the elite dark side troops of the Empire Reborn.
            With the success of their program, Desann and Fyyar initiated an assault on the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. Fyyar's ship, Doomgiver, departed from his headquarters at the secret Cairn Installation and arrived over Yavin 4, where it deployed landing forces.
            Unknown to Fyyar, Katarn had infiltrated his operations. The New Republic saboteur contacted Rogue Squadron, which attacked the Doomgiver upon its exit from hyperspace. Fyyar, in his battle suit, managed to surprise Katarn as he was in the process of destroying the ship's shield generator. Fyyar was too slow, however, and Katarn took out the generator with a lightsaber throw. Enraged, Fyyar attacked Katarn, but even his shielded cortosis armor proved no match for Katarn, who fought and struck the admiral down with his lightsaber. The suit malfunctioned and exploded, vaporizing Fyyar.
            Galak Fyyar was voiced by Steven Jay Blum.
            During combat, Galak's shield generator can be disabled by destroying his armor's antenna with weapon fire.
            There are three ways to defeat Galak in his Cortosis armor, after the shield is brought down. The first one is to use force speed and your lightsaber combined to deliver extra fast strikes while his shield is recovering. Since force speed slows down the action and speeds you up, it will take a seemingly long time for his shield to regenerate, and you can deliver strikes much faster. The second way is to pummel him with force lightning. His armor seems to be highly vulnerable to that attack. This is also effective against his shield. The third way is to use saber throw on him. This will only work when the shield is down because if the player tries to hit the shield with saber throw, the saber will just go inside the shield, and the player will lose control of it on entry.
            The rank plaque on Galak's uniform has a different layout than most others. Rather than consisting of two rows (the top row being four red bars and the bottom row being four blue bars), the plaque contains a single row of eight bars, alternating between red and blue bars every two bars. This might be a custom rank plaque.
            According to The Essential Guide to Warfare, Galak Fyyar would have been a Rear Admiral.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galak_Fyyar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGalakFyyar</string></dict>

        <key>Umak Leth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.183.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Umak Leth was an Imperial engineer. He was one of the chief weapons engineers on the original Death Star.[6]
            During the time leading up to the Clone Wars, Leth was a representative of the Galactic Republic's Ministry of Science. In 22 BBY, Leth participated in a HoloNet debate opposite Nasdra Magrody and Bunt Dantor, where he argued that the mysterious weapon targeting Republic task forces was possibly equipped with cloaking devices. He estimated that the power supply capable of destroying entire task forces of capital ships would require a vessel to be at least 8 kilometers long. He also speculated that a Jenth-class hypermatter core was the possible reactor being used for this.[3]
            During the Great Jedi Purge, Leth designed the Universal Energy Cage to hold and transfer Jedi captives.[7] He also developed the "resonator" devices, weapons which were used to torture and subjugate the Marasan people.[8] He also began work on the World Devastators as early as 0 BBY, with its development being so secret that Leth only relayed the most basic information to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, which he then used in the official field manual Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide.[9] After the Battle of Yavin discredited Bevel Lemelisk, Leth was given the position of Master of Imperial Projects for his creation of an advanced model of molecular furnace.[4]
            Years later he designed the Galaxy Gun for the reborn Emperor Palpatine,[2] as well as the World Devastators,[4] SD-10 battle droids, and Shadow Droids.[10] In addition, he presented the cloned Emperor with the XR-85, allowing the tank droids to finally be fully realized.[11] He was killed when Palpatine's flagship Eclipse II fell out of hyperspace and collided with the Galaxy Gun.[1][12]
            In the audio dramatization of Empire's End, Leth was voiced by John Cygan,[13] and in HoloNet News — A Galaxy Divided, he was voiced by David W. Collins.[3]
            He was to appear in an additional comic, Boba Fett vs. The Empire, where Leth would betray the Empire and Boba Fett would be tasked with hunting him down, but the comic was never developed.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Umak_Leth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascUmakLeth</string></dict>
        <key>Bouris Ulgo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.184.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bouris Ulgo was a Human male who lived during the Great Galactic War and the Cold War, hailing from the Core World of Alderaan.
            Born on Alderaan to the members of the scattered noble House Ulgo, Bouris Ulgo enlisted in the Galactic Republic's military and quickly rose to the rank of General. A distinguished soldier, Ulgo commanded Republic forces throughout the Great Galactic War, and personally won the Battle of Rordak for the Republic when he boarded the battlecruiser of his opponent, Moff Ceptor. Retiring after a twenty-year career, he returned to his homeworld when it devolved into chaos following the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant.
            As contention began to spread throughout the planet's body politic, Ulgo became opposed to the Empire-backing of House Thul, who had returned from exile. But as the Alderaan houses were too fractured to see the obvious Imperial invasion, Ulgo allied himself with House Rist and usurped the throne from House Panteer, (more than likely planning the assassination of Crown Prince Gaul Panteer and his mother, Queen Silara) slaughtering most of the Panteer family. He than declared that Alderaan would be placed under martial law and that he would serve as the new king. This only caused all the houses to turn against him as well.
            Boris Ulgo was eventually removed from the throne by force.
            Ulgo is voiced by Steve Blum.
            There are several phrases written in Aurebesh on his biography page at the official site. When translated, they read: "Search for the Crown", "Panteer Blood", "for Trask".[1]
            One of the last missions on Alderaan for both Republic and Empire is to confront Bouris Ulgo in the throne room of Castle Panteer. For the Republic, they are called upon to do this by Katei Panteer; Darth Viktus, acting to aid House Thul for its bid to take the throne of Alderaan, issues the quest for the Empire. Ultimately, the player is given one of two choices after defeating him. The light side choice is to spare his life, so that he may stand trial for his crimes; the dark side choice, of course, is to kill him. Regardless, his defeat at Castle Panteer ends his reign, leaving the other claimants to battle it out amongst themselves.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bouris_Ulgo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBourisUlgo</string></dict>

            Arik Uvis, a human, was born and grew up in the Core, but by the time he reached his mid-thirties he was living on Lothal working for the office of governor Ryder Azadi. He was assigned to work with the company Pryce Mining six months prior to the discovery of a doonium vein in the mine. During this time he developed a friendly relationship with Talmoor Pryce.[2]
            Six standard months after he was assigned to work with Pryce Mining, Uvis and Azadi stumbled upon the fact that a vein of doonium had been uncovered in the mine belonging to Pryce Mining on Lothal. Wanting to gain control of the doonium vein before Lothal Senator Domus Renking and the Empire could, Azadi dispatched Uvis to attempt to purchase another twenty-one percent, a controlling interest when combined with his and Azadi's current thirty percent, of the company from Arihnda.[2]
            Finding Arihnda in the Pryce Mining corporate building, Uvis was quick to determine the veracity of the rumors that Pryce had discovered doonium. Having confirmed the existence of the doonium, Uvis shifted into his bid for a controlling interest in Pryce Mining. He warned Arihnda that the presence of a doonium vein in her mine would draw unwanted attention, offering Azadi's protection from megacorporations in exchange for the controlling interest. Arihnda dismissed his warnings as nothing more than a takeover attempt and turned down his offer. When she threatened to call guard droids on him, Uvis reluctantly left the premises.[2]
            In retribution for Arihnda's refusal of the offer, Uvis and Azadi falsified embezzlement charges in order to incarcerate Elainye Pryce in an attempt to blackmail Arihnda into selling her company. Talmoor, oblivious to Uvis' role in the attempted takeover, suggested that Arihnda try talking to him to get Elainye released.[2]
            Uvis and Azadi's attempt failed later that day when Arihnda made a deal with Senator Renking to give control of Pryce Mining over to the Empire in exchange for her mother's release, a new job for her parents, and a job working for Renking on Coruscant for her.[2]
            Arik Uvis was a human man[2] with blonde hair and brown eyes.[1] In his mid-thirties, Arik was about the same age as Arihnda Pryce but the latter opined that he was in a "far worse shape than her." On behalf of Governor Azadi, Arik was willing to resort to dirty tricks including harming Arihnda's mother Elainye in order to force her to cede control of Pryce Mining to Governor Azadi. However, Pryce outmaneuvered Azadi by selling her company to the Empire.[2]
            Arik Uvis first appeared in Timothy Zahn's 2017 novel Thrawn, a rebooted Canonical origins story of the eponymous character. Most of his lines are told through the point of view of the tritagonist Arihnda Pryce.
            He was first illustrated in the Marvel Comics Thrawn, Part III, a comic adaptation of the novel which debuted on April 11, 2018. Arik was drawn and inked by Luke Ross, and colored by Nolan Woodard.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Arik_Uvis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascArikUvis</string></dict>
        <key>Ubrik Adelhard</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.187.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ubrik Adelhard was a human male who served the Galactic Empire as the governor of the Anoat sector during the Galactic Civil War. Upon hearing of Emperor Sheev Palpatine's demise at the Battle of Endor, Adelhard locked down his sector, establishing the Iron Blockade and isolating his citizens from news of the Empire's defeat. With the help of Commander Bragh and his Purge Troopers, Adelhard started killing those who opposed the status quo or dared to propagate so-called anti-Imperial rumors or people who wanted to rebel against Adelhard.
            A male human,[1] Ubrik[3] Adelhard started as a mere stormtrooper in the armed forces of the Galactic Empire. A true believer in the need for a strong Empire to keep the galaxy from descending into chaos, he gradually rose up the ranks.[2] Years prior to the Battle of Yavin, Adelhard served as a junior advisor in the Imperial Military. When Imperial forces received word of a base of dissidents on Anoat, the sector capital of the Anoat sector, Adelhard ordered his forces to gas the planet, transforming the city-world into a toxic waste dump. Many citizens believed that the incident was the result of an industrial accident, though a few were privy to the truth.[1] Eventually, Adelhard became one of the rare stormtroopers to become a general.[2] At some point before the Battle of Endor, Adelhard was made the governor of the Anoat sector. He had also married a woman who had ended up being killed by the Kouhun, a secretive order of assassins.[1]
            After the Battle of Endor, a cataclysmic defeat for the Empire in which the Alliance to Restore the Republic destroyed the Death Star II and the Emperor, Sheev Palpatine, was killed,[4] reports of the Empire's defeat began to circulate across the galaxy. The Empire claimed that these reports were lies propagated by the Rebel Alliance. When Adelhard learned that the Emperor had indeed been killed, he locked the Anoat sector down with the Iron Blockade[1] and said that anyone who challenged the Empire in the sector would have to answer to him.[5]
            The Iron Blockade led to an uprising against the Empire, one carried out by a collection of resistance fighters, bounty hunters, smugglers, and more. To combat this uprising, the Empire used Purge Troopers led by Commander Bragh,[6] who reported to Adelhard.[1] Adelhard had a chamber within the prime tower on the Tibanna gas mining colony of Cloud City, located on the planet Bespin. In the months following the Battle of Endor, Lobot hired the pirate Kars Tal-Korla and his companions to capture the Imperial collaborator Borgin Kaa in order to extract an access code needed to open an access hatch leading to Abelhard's personal quarters. Once the hatch was open, Lobot and an intrusion team planned to capture the Governor.[7] Though Adelhard escaped, the planet was soon liberated by the Uprising.[1]
            By the time of the Battle of Jakku, Adelhard's Imperial forces had crumbled under Lando Calrissian's siege. Lando and Lobot led a joint force of Bespin Wing Guards and New Republic soldiers as they mopped up the remaining Imperial holdouts in Cloud City. Calrissian managed to convince a dozen Imperials holed up in the Bolo Tanga room to surrender by telling them that Adelhard's story about Palpatine was a lie.[8]
            Adelhard was a human male with black hair, a full beard, and fair skin.[1] He was a strong supporter of the Galactic Empire and was willing to lock off his entire sector[6] in order to punish those who reported the truth about the Battle of Endor.[1] A man of humble beginnings, he was opposed to luxury and pomp.[2]
            Adelhard is a character who appears in the mobile game Star Wars: Uprising,[1] which was released by Kabam on September 10, 2015.[6]
            The governor was designed by Brian Matyas. One of Matyas' first designs had Adelhard wearing a long cape and an armored chest plate similar to Darth Vader's, but this did not pass the approval process.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ubrik_Adelhard</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascUbrikAdelhard</string></dict>
        <key>Ukabi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.188.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ukabi was a Human male cyborg who lived on Nar Shaddaa, during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He worked as a crime boss, and his refusal to ally himself with the Empire started a conflict that ultimately caused his death[1] and severely damaged his organization's business on the planet.[2]
            Ukabi led an Exchange-affiliated criminal organization in Nar Shaddaa's Corellian Sector. In 3643 BBY, Imperial diplomat Maro Vizhen was sent to oversee the creation of the Shadow Syndicate, which would unite four powerful crime bosses, including Ukabi, in an alliance with the Empire. Ukabi, however, refused to join the group.[2]
            As Ukabi's operations were now a nuisance and a threat to the Empire's interests, Maro Vizhen employed the services of an Imperial-aligned individual to disrupt his group's activities. Both his group's men and infrastructure were target of a massive attack,[2] to which Ukabi retaliated with all-out war. The Empire's enforcer managed to invade Ukabi's base of operations and kill his four trusted lieutenants, only to find that Ukabi had Vizhen cornered in her own base. Before dealing with the diplomat, Ukabi was confronted and struck down by the enforcer.[1]
            Ukabi was a powerful warrior. His body had numerous cybernetic implants designed to enhance his survival and fighting capabilities. He was also a competent and ruthless leader, forcing the Empire to recognize him as a threat.
            Ukabi and his gang are the main antagonists of a series of missions in Star Wars: The Old Republic, available to all Imperial classes.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ukabi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascUkabi</string></dict>

In 3 ABY, after Imperial forces took control of the city, Hood participated in the city's evacuation.
            Willrow Hood[2] was a human male who was present aboard the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Harbinger when it was hijacked by the Rebel Alliance[3] in the year 0 ABY.[4] For fear that the overloaded reactor might explode, the admiral in command of the Harbinger ordered the passengers and crew to abandon ship before the Rebels set foot aboard it. Along with stormtroopers and technicians, Hood rushed to a hangar for evacuation.[3]
            In 3 ABY,[5] Hood was on Cloud City, in the atmosphere of Bespin, when the Galactic Empire took up occupation of it. As Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian informed the platform's citizens of the takeover, causing many to attempt to flee, Hood ran through the city's corridors and passed by Calrissian and his Rebel allies Princess Leia Organa, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 as they made their own escape.[1]
            During the Imperial blockade of the Anoat sector[6] in 4 ABY,[5] however, Hood was still on Cloud City. Months into the blockade, he was occasionally seen at the Paradise Atrium, an upper-class lounge owned by Voras the Hutt, leader of the criminal Ivax Syndicate.[6]
            Willrow Hood first appeared as an extra in the film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back,[1] released on May 21, 1980.[7] The character was initially identified by the Legends Star Wars Customizable Card Game[8] released in 1997, with his name being brought into canon by the Star Wars: Card Trader video game.[2] Based on the ice cream maker-like prop Hood carries in the film, he is often known to fans as "Ice Cream Guy," "Ice Cream Maker Guy," or "Ice Cream Man".[9][10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Willrow_Hood</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWillrowHood</string></dict>
        <key>Vanden Willard</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.190.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vanden Willard was a male human who served as a commander and later general in the Rebel Alliance. He served at the Rebel base on Yavin 4 during the Battle of Yavin. He was killed when his cruiser was attacked by the Executor near the Mako-Ta Space Docks.
            Vanden Willard[4] was a commander[2] and later general[5] in the Rebel Alliance at the time of the Battle of Yavin. After Princess Leia Organa was rescued from aboard the Galactic Empire's Death Star by Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2, and returned to the hidden rebel base on Yavin 4, Willard greeted them and was glad to know Organa was safe, as when they heard about the destruction of Alderaan, they feared the worst.[2]
            When it was discovered that the ship they had used, the Millennium Falcon, was tracked and that the Death Star had arrived.[2] Willard was responsible for reviewing the flight simulator records of any pilot who wished to fly an X-wing starfighter for the Rebel Alliance prior to granting their recruitment.[6] Willard later helped coordinate the battle against the superweapon.[2] During the battle, Willard was in the war room with a Control Officer, General Jan Dodonna, Colonel Bandwin Cor, and Organa. When Dodonna asked whether there were any other reversion signatures, Willard replied that it was just the Death Star's. A partial transcript of recordings from the war room, which included Willard's comment, was eventually placed in The Rebel Files.[5]
            After a failed meeting with Regent Urtya on Mon Cala in an attempt to recruit the Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet, Willard was present at the Mako-Ta Space Docks in a meeting of Alliance High Command when Chancellor Mon Mothma requested the report on Mon Cala by Organa. As Organa stated that Urtya would never lead a mutiny against the Empire, Willard reacted with disappointment. Organa continued, and outlined her plan to rescue King Lee-Char, in order to secure an alliance with the Mon Calamari and incorporate the fleet into their own naval forces.[3]
            Eventually, Organa and her team were able to breach a prison on Strokill Prime and find Lee-Char. Too injured to move, they recorded his final words before he was killed by Imperial stormtroopers.[7] Although Urtya was able to recover the recordings from Organa, he sent the message to the Fleet Captains of the Mon Cala fleet, resulting in their mutiny and defection to the Rebel Alliance.[8]
            After the mutiny, Willard was given command of a cruiser that had been refitted for combat by the Kingdom of Shu-Torun, by order of Queen Trios. Willard utilized the cruiser as the flagship of Delta Group and remained present at the Mako-Ta Space Docks during a ceremony celebrating the new Alliance Fleet and for rebel personnel and rebel allies to witness the dispersal of the rebel naval forces. During the ceremony, Willard invited Organa to his cruiser, but she turned down the request, preferring to be with Mothma just in case she was needed.[1]
            Prior to launch, Organa asked for a check-in of sub-groups, and Willard was the final one to confirm that group had no issues. Willard also told Organa to tell Mothma good luck for her speech, believing that she would stun the crowd. After Organa informed Mothma that the fleet was ready, she also mentioned Willard's statement, and told Mothma that he knew he would be impressed.[1]
            As the ships were ready to launch into hyperspace, an error prevented the launch of the Willard's cruiser, as well as all the other ships that had been refitted with Shu-Torun technology. The fault resulted in the failure of all launches, lost communications, disabled armament, and the ships being unable to launch their starfighters. At the same time, Death Squadron, under the command of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, arrived and fired on the nearest cruiser, Willard's starship.[1]
            As Willard's cruiser was attacked by the Executor and an accompanying Imperial-class Star Destroyer, Mothma, Organa, General Davits Draven, and other rebel personnel watched on in horror from the base. Consistently pummeled by laser fire, Willard ordered all power to be routed to the deflector shields, but a crewmember stated that they were quickly losing them. In response, Willard ordered that the ship be abandoned, but the ship was quickly annihilated as Willard told his crew that may the Force be with them all.[1]
            An enormous eruption engulfed the cruiser, and Darth Vader looked on from the bridge of the Executor, satisfied that the rebels now understood and that he felt their terror.[1]
            Willard, a human male, had fair skin, graying hair, and dark colored eyes.[1]
            As a general, Willard was able to command others. When his cruiser was attacked, he recognized that the shields required full power, but was not able to recognize earlier that the cruiser had to be evacuated.[1] Willard had the ability to review flight simulator records, and make a determination on whether pilots were able to fly X-wing starfighters before recruiting them.[6]
            As an Alliance officer, Willard was dressed in officer fatigues and wore the command insignia of a general on the left side of his chest.[2] While in command of Beta Group, Willard utilized a cruiser as his flagship.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vanden_Willard</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVandenWillard</string></dict>

        <key>Weazel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.192.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Weazel was a human male thief turned freedom fighter who lived in the last days of the Galactic Republic and during the reign of the Galactic Empire. As a thief, he worked for the Hutt Clan out of Mos Espa on Tatooine, where he was present for the Boonta Eve Classic podrace in 32 BBY that was won by Anakin Skywalker. During the age of the Empire, Weazel worked with Enfys Nest and her Cloud-Riders, who sought to fight back against the crime lords who had wronged them as well as the Empire. He was Nest's best lieutenant and most vigilant spy.
            Weazel lived on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine in 32 BBY, where he worked as a thief for the ruling Hutt Clan in the spaceport settlement of Mos Espa. During the time of the Trade Federation's Invasion of Naboo, Weazel attended the Boonta Eve Classic podrace in Mos Espa where he sat with Watto, a Toydarian junk dealer who placed a large sum of money on the reigning champion Sebulba to win. Weazel cheered Sebulba on throughout the race, but the Dug racer was ultimately beaten by the young Anakin Skywalker[1]—the boy who would grow up to become Darth Vader,[3] the enforcer of the Galactic Empire[4] that Weazel came to fight against during the Imperial Era.[5]
            By the time the Empire was in power, Weazel had left behind his life as a thief and joined the Cloud-Riders, a group of vigilante marauders led by Enfys Nest.[2] While rivals such as Tobias Beckett believed them to be pirate thieves, they were actually aspiring rebels who wanted to fight for and bring justice to those who had been victimized by the Empire and the criminal syndicates that ran rampant in the galaxy, such as Crimson Dawn.[5] Weazel became Nest's most trusted lieutenant and vigilant spy,[2] and together they and the Cloud-Riders had numerous run-ins with Beckett and his crew, who often worked for Crimson Dawn.[5]
            In 11 BBY, Weazel accompanied Nest, Callixido Ryss and Moda Maxa to Gargon to raid an Imperial spice cache in order to retrieve medicinally processed spice. The raid was ultimately succesful and the obtained spice was segmented into ready-to-implement triage kits and emergency packs, but they left the raw spice behind even though they could have stolen it to refine it for narcotic usage and make a fortune by selling it. This action left Agent Andressa Divo of the Imperial Security Bureau surprised, who noted that the Cloud-Riders were likely building an army and readying to go to war.[6]
            The Cloud-Riders last run-in with Beckett's gang, however, took place in 10 BBY,[2] when the Cloud-Riders caught wind of a heist Beckett and his team were pulling on Vandor for Crimson Dawn. While Beckett, his partner Val, pilot Rio Durant, and newcomers Han Solo and Chewbacca attempted to steal the hyperfuel known as coaxium from an Imperial conveyex train, the Cloud-Riders attacked on swoop bikes and attempted to steal the loot for themselves. The resulting encounter led to some Cloud-Rider casualties as well as the deaths of Val and Durant. Neither team was able to steal the loot; as each attempted to take the train car carrying the coaxium for themselves, the pilot Solo detached the car from the AT-hauler he was flying and it crashed into a mountain. Weazer and the others survived the resulting massive explosion of hyperfuel, and each went their separate ways.[5]
            Beckett arranged a new operation with Crimson Dawn to steal coaxium from the spice mines of Kessel, an operation the Cloud-Riders also caught wind of. Weazel followed Beckett’s team as they met with Lando Calrissian and arranged for him and his ship, the Millennium Falcon, to help them make the Kessel Run in enough time to bring the stolen unrefined coaxium to Savareen for refinement. Having learned that Calrissian was part of the operation, Weazel placed a tracking device on the Millennium Falcon so the Cloud-Riders could keep tabs on where Beckett and his team were ultimately headed.[5]
            The Cloud-Riders confronted Beckett's gang once they arrived on Savareen, and they engaged in a brief standoff. Nest ultimately explained the true motives of the Cloud-Riders, presenting Beckett's team with a choice about whether to hand the coaxium over to Crimson Dawn or allow the Cloud-Riders to take it and use the millions of credits to attain their goals. As such, Solo and Qi'ra ended up killing  Dryden Vos and a traiterous Beckett in the result. Due to the actions and help of Han Solo, the Cloud-Riders were able to acquire the coaxium. Weazel secured it their transports as Nest told Solo what they wanted it for: to fuel a rebellion.[5]
            Weazel was a human male with brown hair, blue eyes, and light skin. Weazel, who stood shorter than most humans,[5] was once a common criminal for one of the five major crime syndicates but ultimately turned against them and believed in bringing justice to those hurt by the syndicates and the Empire. As part of his operations, he carried a K21c portable ordnance launcher from Merr-Sonn Munitions and wore a Kalevalan tracker helmet that was equipped with a rangefinder[2] and a device that enabled him to communicate with Nest.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Weazel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWeazel</string></dict>

        <key>Tristan Wren</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.197.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tristan Wren, the brother of Sabine Wren, was a Mandalorian human male. He was the son of Alrich and Ursa Wren, who led Clan Wren. After Sabine deserted the Imperial Academy on Mandalore, Tristan was forced to join Gar Saxon's Super Commandos in order to keep their clan's dignity. In 2 BBY, Tristan reunited with his sister Sabine after she and her rebel companions tried to convince Clan Wren to aid the rebellion. When Gar Saxon ordered the destruction of Clan Wren, Tristan chose his family and joined the rebels and Fenn Rau in defeating Saxon and his warriors.
            Tristan later helped Sabine and her rebel allies to evacuate the Phoenix Cell during the Battle of Atollon. He and his family fought against Clan Saxon and the Galactic Empire during the Mandalorian civil war.
            Tristan Wren was the son of Alrich Wren, Countess Ursa Wren and the younger brother of Sabine Wren. After Sabine abandoned the Imperial Academy on Mandalore and joined the rebellion, Clan Wren's loyalties to the Empire were called into question. Tristan was forced to join Viceroy Gar Saxon's Imperial Super Commandos in order to prove his family's loyalty to Saxon and the Galactic Empire. His father was also kept a hostage of Saxon on Mandalore to guarantee his family's loyalty. Tristan lived with his mother Ursa on the planet Krownest.[2]
            In 2 BBY, Tristan led a patrol of Clan Wren warriors which intercepted and shot down Sabine's shuttle Phantom II. Sabine and her rebel comrades Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, Fenn Rau, and Chopper were traveling on a mission to Krownest to solicit Clan Wren's support for the rebellion. After the Phantom II crashed on the snow, Tristan and his comrades confronted Sabine, Kanan, and Ezra. Tristan initially did not recognize Sabine because she was wearing her Mandalorian helmet. When Ezra ignited his green lightsaber, Tristan and his companions opened fire, leading to a brief firefight. When he heard Sabine's voice, Tristan ordered a cease fire and removed his helmet.[2]
            While Tristan was friendly towards Sabine and her rebel friends and agreed to lead them to the Wren Stronghold, he warned Sabine that he could not vouch for their mother's hospitality. During the journey, Sabine confronted Tristan about his Imperial Super Commando armor. Tristan warned that she should not have returned since her family still regarded her as a traitor. Upon arriving at the Wren Stronghold, Ursa ordered Sabine's incarceration but Sabine managed to convince her mother to grant her and her friends an audience by showing the Darksaber, an important symbol of House Vizsla; of which Clan Wren was a member. Ursa reluctantly acceded to her daughter's request but ordered the rebels to surrender their weapons.[2]
            Inside the throne room, Tristan and his warriors maintained a vigil as Ursa appraised her daughter of their family's circumstances. Tristan and his mother regarded the Journeyman Protectors and their leader Fenn Rau as traitors and sought to justify the Protectors' execution by Saxon. After Ursa and Sabine left for a private meeting, the Jedi Rebels Ezra tried to make light conversation with Tristan. However, Kanan insisted on handling the negotiations and told Tristan that he desired an audience with Countess Ursa. Tristan later informed his mother and sister that Gar Saxon was requesting a hologram conversation with Ursa. Still on good terms with Sabine, Tristan invited her for a sparring session in the training room. [2]
            While sparring with metal rods, Sabine thanked Tristan for practicing with her. When Sabine asked if he thought she was a traitor, Tristan told her he did not think so but that the other clans viewed them with suspicion. Tristan vowed to help restore his family's standing to protect their father. Tristan then informed his sister of their mother's plan to trade the rebels and the Darksaber with Saxon in return for their safety. Tristan followed Sabine to he throne room where they discovered Gar Saxon and his Super Commandos taking the Jedi rebels and the Darksaber into their custody. When Sabine protested, Tristan told her that it was for the best.[2]
            When Ursa demanded that Saxon uphold his side of the bargain, Saxon ordered his men to exterminate Clan Wren for "colluding" with rebels. Tristan protested but Saxon gave him the choice of standing by him or dying with his family. Tristan chose his family and pointed his blaster at Saxon. The Wrens and rebels were aided by Rau, who handed the Jedi their weapons and helped the rebels and Clan Wren defeat Saxon's warriors. Tristan shot the last of Saxon's Super Commandos. Tristan and and the others then watched as Sabine dueled with Saxon on the ice outside their stronghold. Sabine managed to defeat Saxon and reclaimed the Darksaber. However, she spared Saxon's life. When Saxon tried to kill her, Ursa shot him dead.[2]
            Sabine's defeat of Saxon regained her family's respect.

        <key>Pol Treidum</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.199.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Pol Treidum was a a male Human gantry officer who was in charge of maintaining the magnetic field, atmosphere, and security in Docking Bay 327 aboard the first Death Star. He held the rank of lieutenant.
            After the Alliance to Restore the Republic's successful mission on Ralltiir, Treidum was constantly paranoid of Rebel spies infiltrating the Death Star.[1]
            In 0 BBY he was stationed in Docking Control Room 327 when he noticed two stormtroopers were not at their posts by the captured Millennium Falcon. After trying unsuccessfully to hail stormtrooper TK-421 through the comm system, Treidum looked out of the observation port to see a disguised Luke Skywalker walk down the Falcon's loading ramp and bump a fist at his helmet. Taking this to mean there was a faulty transmitter, Pol opened the door to go check on the problem, only to be knocked back into the room by Chewbacca's fist. His partner was shot by Han Solo while he was killed by Chewbacca.[1]
            Pol Treidum chose to wear the prominent sideburns that were popular among the Imperial officer class at the time.[2] Other serving Imperial officers who wore their hair in this fashion, many of whom were also assigned to the Death Star, included Cassio Tagge, Conan Motti, Moradmin Bast and Nahdonnis Praji.
            Peter Sumner played Pol Treidum in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. He reprised the role in the 1999 fan film The Dark Redemption.
            According to West End Games game designer Paul Sudlow, fellow WEG designer George R. Strayton named Treidum after Sudlow while writing color text for Decipher's A New Hope Limited Expansion. "Pol" was a Star Wars version of Sudlow's given name, while "Treidum" was inspired by Captain Rolf Treidum, an Imperial officer he created for The Kathol Outback supplement of The DarkStryder Campaign.[source?]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pol_Treidum</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPolTreidum</string></dict>
        <key>Trenox</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.200.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Trenox was a Dark Acolyte, who worked for Count Dooku during the Clone Wars.
            Trenox was a bald man who wielded a red lightsaber and wore all black. He was taught Form II of lightsaber combat by Count Dooku himself.
            Trenox helped Count Dooku command the Separatist forces in the Coruscant Insurrection of the Clone Wars. During the battle, Trenox fled from Anakin Skywalker to Bentho's Nightclub, located on the underlevels of the city. Dexter Jettster was in the lower levels when Trenox threatened him. The diner owner was able to escape from the Acolyte. Trenox stopped to fight Anakin in a club then fled again. He jumped into a speeder hoping to lose the Jedi.
            Later on, Trenox sneaked into the Jedi Temple with Count Dooku. He confronted Anakin in the temple, but after a long duel Trenox was defeated by Skywalker.
            Trenox wielded his lightsaber like a club, and roared to intimidate his opponents. He was able to knock Anakin Skywalker down with a casual nudge of the Force, render him momentarily unconscious, and could break through Anakin's Form V with his brute strength. Dooku had also taught Trenox the more refined Form II.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Trenox</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTrenox</string></dict>
        <key>Tremel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.201.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tremel was a male Human Sith Overseer at the Sith Academy, on Korriban. During the Cold War, he was tasked in selecting worthy acolytes to become Sith. He was responsible for the arrival and initiation of a promising acolyte, who would become his protégé.
            For decades between the Great Galactic War and the Cold War, Tremel administered the trials to acolytes that proved themselves worthy to join the Sith Order. He made these trials very difficult for those that are strong to survive and weed out the weak.
            Tremel was directly involved in selecting and preparing a promising new acolyte, whom he wanted to be a rival to Vemrin, an acolyte seeking to become the new apprentice of a powerful Sith Lord, Darth Baras. Tremel considered Vemrin to be an "impure" Sith, as Vemrin had come from Balmorra rather than the old Sith Worlds, and Vemrin's family had no history of Sith lineage or even Force-sensitivity. To ensure Vemrin's rival would succeed, Tremel summoned the acolyte to Korriban ahead of schedule.
            Tremel's unwillingness to adapt would prove to be his undoing, as Baras commanded his new apprentice to assassinate him. In the following duel, Tremel was outmatched and struck down by his former protégé, the latter bringing the former's hand back to Baras as proof of his death. Tremel's daughter, Eskella Gryton, was also slain later by Baras's apprentice after she tried to exact revenge for her father's demise. His protégé would eventually win Baras's favor, dueling and killing Vemrin when confronted inside the Tomb of Naga Sadow.
            Tremel was a calm and collected man, a loyal subject to the Empire. He was displeased with the academy's policy for admittance, and in a broader scope, with the directions taken by the Empire during its conflict with the Galactic Republic. His reluctance to embrace these changes was shown to be a major reason behind Baras's decision to have him assassinated.
            Tremel was proficient with his single-bladed Sith lightsaber which he used in combat. Tremel had some power with the dark side of the Force as well.
            Tremel is voiced by Paul Darrow in Star Wars: The Old Republic.
            The Warrior can chose to either kill or spare Tremel. If killed, Eskella would attempt to avenge her father, only to be slain. If the Warrior spared his life then eventually an enraged Eskella found Tremel in hiding, she attacked him and Tremel was forced to kill his own daughter. Only then did he wish revenge on Baras for what he had done to him.
            He would later come out of hiding at the request of Darth Vowrawn to bear witness to his student defeating Darth Baras and ending his claim as the Voice of the Emperor.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tremel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTremel</string></dict>
        <key>Antinnis Tremayne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.202.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Antinnis Tremayne was a Human male cyborg who served as an Imperial High Inquisitor during the Galactic Civil War. The apprentice of Darth Vader, Tremayne was initially trained as a Padawan by Master Dav Kylanu. When his master perished during the Clone Wars, Tremayne was captured by enemy troops, and was forced to sit out the rest of the war. With the advent of the New Order, he did not fall victim to Order 66 or the Great Jedi Purge, and was instead taken to Byss with other captive Jedi-in-training. There, he was recruited by Vader to be a founding member of a new division of Imperial Intelligence, the Inquisitorius.
            Tremayne quickly turned to the dark side of the Force, and was dedicated to hunting down fugitive Jedi who might potentially damage the Empire. He obsessed over his targets; in particular, he spent several months hunting "Jodd Sonta," actually the Jedi Padawan Drake Lo'gaan. Though he failed to capture or kill Lo'gaan, he was given other tasks, such as the discovery and conversion of fugitive Jedi on far-flung worlds. He was able to convert many to the cause of the Inquisitorius, and began honing his skills as an interrogator. In time, Tremayne was unparalleled in the field of interrogation, and was often called upon by COMPNOR and Imperial Intelligence when resilient subjects arose.
            Tremayne's reputation spread, and he became feared by ally and enemy alike. He began obsessing over another Jedi, Corwin Shelvay, but that particular pursuit resulted in the loss of Tremayne's eye and arm. Nevertheless, he was able to slay Jedi Master Darrin Arkanian, boosting his confidence further. He was given command of the Interrogator, which he used to root out Rebel cells and pursue turncoat Dark Side Adepts. When the Empire fell, Tremayne decided to ally himself with another of Vader's former students, Hethrir. Despite this, the Procurator of Justice's splinter movement was quickly eliminated by the New Republic.
            At the age of nineteen months, Antinnis Tremayne was handed over to the Jedi Order, to be trained as a Jedi Knight[1] though, unlike other Jedi, he remained in contact with his family, namely his mother. When he reached the age of fifteen, he was selected by Jedi Master Dav Kylanu as an apprentice. After three years as Kylanu's Padawan, Tremayne was scolded for his vain nature and Kylanu taught him that truth was more relevant to the Jedi.[3] Despite Kylanu's presence, Tremayne grew increasingly fascinated by the dark side of the Force—an interest that caused concern amongst the rest of the Order. Nevertheless, Tremayne fought in the Clone Wars, but with each passing mission, the brutality of the conflict deeply affected the young man.[7] On one mission, Kylanu was killed by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, with Tremayne captured and held prisoner until 19 BBY.[1]
            With the Declaration of a New Order and Order 66, the Jedi Order was effectively destroyed, with the surviving Jedi going into hiding. Tremayne was among those captured by Palpatine's agents, and he was taken to the Deep Core world of Byss. There, under the supervision of Sly Moore, he was kept in custody along with other captured Padawans and Agricultural Corps members. When the new Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader arrived on Byss for an inspection tour, he was told by his master, Palpatine, to select worthy pupils to form a Jedi-hunting team, the Inquisitorius. Palpatine had the cuffs of the prisoners deactivated, and they were given staffs with which to attack Vader.[2]
            Vader, unarmed, easily fended off the Padawans, and mocked their lack of skill. While Vader was throttling two of the prisoners, Tremayne saw an opportunity: Vader's chest panel, which helped regulate his artificial breathing. He pressed one of the buttons on the panel, causing the Dark Lord to drop the prisoners and gasp for breath. Vader, impressed, selected four potential pupils: Tremayne, Gwellib Ap-Llewff, Lanu Pasiq, and Halmere, while the remaining Padawans and AgriCorps members were executed. Now in the employ of the Empire as Darth Vader's apprentice, Tremayne fell to the dark side of the Force.[2]
            One of Tremayne's first assignments was to give a speech at the Jrade District on Coruscant, where he was to address the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order's Sub-Adult Group. He applauded Palpatine's policies and hinted at the new Human supremacy that would dominate the galaxy. He also talked about progression in the New Order, and told the teenage audience that they would be exempted from the curfew restriction were they to join COMPNOR. Tremayne also offered jobs to those seeking pay. Following his speech, he had Halmere get the names of all those present, as he detected a Jedi presence amongst the crowd.[2]
            Following the recruitment drive, Tremayne entered a sparring session with his fellow Inquisitors. As Vader watched them duel, Tremayne told his new master of the Jedi presence, and rumors from the lower levels of a rogue Padawan. During the duel, Vader chastised Tremayne for being on the defensive, and ordered him to attack. When Tremayne had gained the upper hand over all of his fellow Inquisitors, Vader ordered him to hunt down and destroy the Jedi.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Antinnis_Tremayne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAntinnisTremayne</string></dict>

            When Hendar returned to the outcast village pursued by rakghouls, he asked Trewin to open the gate so he could get in. Although not willing to leave Hendar to die, Trewin refused him entry, believing that this would allow the pursuing rakghoul to enter the village and ultimately infect the other outcasts. Revan then volunteered to fight off the rakghoul so that Hendar could return safely. Trewin admitted to Revan that he was impressed by the up-worlder's generosity and compassion, and believed he had learned a lesson from it. He like the other Outcasts left the village for the Promised Land when its location was discovered and left the gate open at the village’s departure.[1]
            Alternatively, Revan could have refused to help Hendar and watched him get killed by the rakghoul, to Hester's dismay. Trewin would then voice his regret over Hendar's death, but said he warned him.

Tarandon also proposed that the captured Republic Foundation Museum be converted into a celebration of Imperial culture.[2]

        <key>Trachta</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.206.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Trachta was a Human male Imperial Grand Moff over the Imperial Center Oversector who unsuccessfully masterminded the Anti-Sith conspiracy and attempted to kill Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader during the Galactic Civil War.
            Trachta appeared to be a Human male, but was encased with cybernetic implants after being horribly maimed by a thermal detonator during the Clone Wars at the hand of a Jedi Padawan defecting to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. His most distinctive feature was a triangular breath mask that fed into the mechanical lungs required to keep him alive and obscured his pale face. In addition to his cybernetic respiratory system, Trachta's organic eyes were replaced with ocular cameras, and a third ocular camera was installed in the back of his head, allowing him to see behind him.
            Trachta first met Senator Palpatine during the last years of the Republic. He was impressed by a lecture given at the Republic University and offered his services to Palpatine if ever they were needed. Palpatine forwarded Trachta's records to the Republic Military Academy, where Trachta became an instructor in tactics and intelligence.[1]
            In the first days of the Clone Wars, Agent Trachta coordinated the transfer of Tark Squad from Kamino to the Golandras in the Marat system. This squad was actually a team of clones from the Dark Worlds, the Empire of Zeta Magnus. Designed to infiltrate the Grand Army of the Republic, the clones were eventually destroyed by Jedi Halagad Ventor during the Battle of Skye.[2] Serving as liaison between the Jedi High Council and Armand Isard at the Senate Bureau of Intelligence, Trachta was personally assigned by Chancellor Palpatine to investigate and capture Jedi leaving the Republic for the side of Count Dooku. On one mission to the planet of Noctralis they tracked a Padawan who had joined Dooku. Trachta and a team of clone troopers surrounded the Padawan, but he armed a thermal detonator and used the Force to throw it at Trachta and his men. The clones were incinerated, as were Trachta's arms and eyes. He was brought back to Coruscant, where his arms and eyes were replaced with cybernetics, as well as his damaged respiratory system. Trachta resumed his service by the end of the Clone Wars.[1]
            Trachta, as a loyal servant of Palpatine, became one of the first Moffs in the Galactic Empire, where he ruled over the Imperial Center Oversector. He served as the commander of the 1st Sector Army during the Clone Wars.[3] Trachta held an intense rivalry with the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Military and Sith Lord Darth Vader.
            Shortly after the creation of the New Order, Trachta was forced to work alongside Darth Vader and Lieutenant Laurita Tohm. Palpatine was severely injured from a terrorist attack shortly after the graduation of various Imperial cadets, organized by Headmaster Gentis as part of a military coup against the Emperor. Like Vader, Trachta survived the airborne viral attack because of his breathing apparatus. When Vader and Tohm encountered him near the weakened Emperor, they immediately accused him of being involved in the coup, but Trachta vehemently denied any involvement. The trio sought a refuge for the Emperor where no one could find him, and Vader realized that only one such place existed—the secret Jedi prison known as the Prism. While Vader and Tohm went to the Jedi Temple to find the location of the Prism, Trachta remained with the Emperor in a secret shuttle hangar, and fought off a medical droid re-programmed to kill Imperial officers.
            On the journey to the Diab system, Trachta recounted the origin of his injuries to Tohm, and in return, learned how the young lieutenant had been disfigured. After landing at the Prism, Trachta and Tohm destroyed the droid guards while Vader slew the lone Jedi warden. After reviewing the prison records with Vader and Tohm, Trachta discovered that the rogue Jedi who had caused his injuries was imprisoned within the facility. Trachta and Tohm found the fallen Jedi's cell within the prison and Trachta told Tohm to seal the cell behind him, as he would not be leaving for many hours. He then began to savagely beat the Jedi with his cybernetic fists, exacting bloody revenge.[4]
            Vader amended Tohm's idea, and rather than simply releasing the prisoners, he forced 207 of them to fight one another, as well as Tohm and himself, for the right to serve the Empire.[4] The battle was vicious and wild, with casualties mounting quickly. In the end, only thirty-three prisoners survived in fighting condition, and Vader ordered Trachta to tell the survivors what it meant to serve the Empire. He told the survivors that their crimes were now forgotten, but their reasons for committing them were not—they would now serve an institution not beholden to the "selfish" senators of the Republic, nor the Jedi Order. The prisoners knelt before Trachta and the others, becoming Imperials through their submission. He then told them that their training was to begin that night.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Trachta</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTrachta</string></dict>
        <key>Gall Trayvis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.207.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gall Trayvis was a male politician who served as a member of the Imperial Senate during the reign of the Galactic Empire. He left the Imperial Senate and posed as a dissident Senator, one critical of the Imperial regime, in order to lure rebellious forces towards destruction.
            Gall Trayvis served as a member of the Imperial Senate after the rise of the Galactic Empire.[2] According to rebel fighter Hera Syndulla, Trayvis was the only Imperial Senator who spoke out against the Galactic Empire. In reality, Trayvis remained an Imperial agent and simply posed as a dissident and exiled politician, which allowed him to gain the loyalty of rebel forces and lead them towards their destruction.[3]
            Five years before the Battle of Yavin, Trayvis sent a message via a hacked HoloNet News transmission stating that Jedi Master Luminara Unduli had survived the Clone Wars and was being imprisoned on Stygeon Prime. The rebels mounted a rescue mission, but found that Unduli was dead and that it was a trap by the Grand Inquisitor.[2] He later broke into Kastle's report on the death of Master Unduli telling citizens not to trust the Empire's account and to keep her memory alive,[4] though his loyalties meant that the message was a ruse.[3]
            A short time later, Trayvis sent out another broadcast, this one on the fifteenth anniversary of the rise of the Empire. Trayvis' message, which was seen in such establishments as Old Jho's Pit Stop on Lothal, urged Imperial citizens to boycott celebrations associated with Empire Day as a form of protest against what Trayvis decried as the injustices of the Imperial regime.[5] Given his loyalties, this message was also likely a ruse, possibly to lure out protestors against the Empire and get them arrested.
            After the events of Empire Day, he broadcasted a message hoping to lure the Lothal rebels to the Lothal City Capitol Building on Lothal. In reality, Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau and Minister Maketh Tua were orchestrating a covert operation to capture the Lothal rebels. The Lothal rebels managed to find Senator Trayvis in the building, but were quickly ambushed by stormtroopers. While Trayvis tried to convince the rebels to surrender, the rebels managed to escape after Sabine Wren and Garazeb Orrelios dropped smoke bombs from the rafters. Travyis and his rebel would-be rescuers then fled into the old sewers beneath Lothal's Capital City. During the escape, Trayvis feigned exhaustion in order to buy time for the stormtrooper pursuers. They eventually split up, and the senator was escorted by Ezra Bridger and Hera Syndulla.[3]
            When they reached a large fan generator Hera, who suspected Travyis' treachery, handed him her blaster. Travyis then took the opportunity to show his true colors and attempted to take them captive. Travyis told Hera and Ezra that he was actually helping the Empire to find and hunt down rebels. He also revealed that he had known Ezra's parents and claimed responsibility for their deaths, mocking the Bridgers for recklessly throwing their lives away in the name of freedom rather than submission. As he tried to kill them, he discovered that Hera had not charged her blaster, having suspected his true loyalties from his recent actions. Hera then punched him, knocking him out. When Trayvis came to, the rebels had escaped and Kallus looked at him with disgust.[3]
            Following the failed Imperial operation, Trayvis was interviewed by the HoloNet News anchor Alton Kastle. During the interview, Trayvis confirmed that he had "recommitted" himself to the Empire and claimed that he wanted to make the Empire a better place through peaceful means. He also took the opportunity to denounce that the Lothal rebels, whom he labeled insurgents, for twisting his message into something violent and frightening. At the end of the broadcast, Travyis announced that he was offering a reward for their capture. Travyis' broadcast prompted the Lothal rebels to hijack the Imperial Communications Center at Jalath in order to broadcast their own message to the people of Lothal.[6]
            Gall Trayvis was a human male with fair skin and blue eyes.[2] Five years before the Battle of Yavin, his appearance was that of an older man,[4] with dark but graying hair.[2] He posed as a dissident Senator who despised the Empire and its authoritarian regime, and one who applauded any and all rebellious activity. In reality, however, he was still loyal to the Empire and secretly enjoyed the terrible fates that rebels would suffer due to his actions. When meeting Ezra Bridger, he coldly mocked his parents for their dissidence and cruelly revealed that he had had a hand in their disappearance. He was also a coward, as he had an arrogant and self-assured demeanour when he had the rebels at gunpoint, which dissolved into snivelling weakness when disarmed.
            Gall Trayvis first appeared as a voice over the HoloNet in "Rise of the Old Masters," the third episode of the first season of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels. He was voiced by Brent Spiner who was known for playing Lieutenant Commander Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gall_Trayvis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGallTrayvis</string></dict>

        <key>Cavik Toth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.210.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cavik Toth was a Human ally of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and pledged the support of his mercenary group, Sabaoth Squadron, to Count Dooku's cause prior to the Clone Wars.
            Toth had spent many years working for various mercenary groups where he learned his tactical and combat skills. Eventually, he founded his own mercenary force, which was known as the Sabaoth Squadron. Toth was placed in command of the trihexalon project carried out by a group of Neimoidian scientists led by Harro Ruuk. However, when Harro Ruuk was behind schedule, Toth decided to take full command of the project killing Harro and two of his assistants with a sample of the weapon. Once the chemical weapon was complete, Toth decided first to test the weapon on Point Modie, a colony located in Maramere. The test was considered a success as it had killed hundreds of individuals, thankfully Jedi Master Adi Gallia, along with Reti and Sol Sixxa stopped the demonstration before any more damage could be done. Toth then planned to unleash it upon the Republic. However, the pirate captain Nym, leader of the Lok Revenants arrived at Nod Kartha and destroyed the Hex factory, effectively stopping production. Toth then went to Lok when it was attacked by Nym's pirates who were trying to reclaim their planet. Cavik Toth managed to escape but left Bella behind believing she can handle the pirate attack while he went to Geonosis to help the CIS in their losing battle against the Republic. He was wrong and Bella was killed.
            Upon arrival at Geonosis, Toth's Hex fleet of Hex Deployers were ambushed and destroyed by a Jedi starfighter squadron led by Jedi Master Adi Gallia. Toth himself brought his Sabaoth Destroyers into battle. However, the capital ship turrets on all ships were destroyed allowing the Mere cruisers to destroy them one by one. Soon he brought his flagship into the battle, though let pride get the better of him his ships defenses were soon stripped and his flagship soon suffered hull damage. He then engaged Adi Gallia in starfighter combat.
            Cavik Toth was killed above Geonosis by Adi Gallia, while flying his personal starfighter, moments before his flagship exploded.
            An ambitious young man, Toth was a natural leader and a confident warrior, these traits would allow him to control a sizable mercenary force. He was also overconfident and persistent, traits that would ultimately lead to his downfall. His prime motivation was money, so he would pledge his services to the highest bidder; in this case, Count Dooku.

        <key>Toshma Jefkin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.214.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Toshma Jefkin was a human male who served as a soldier in the Rebel Alliance's military and as a guard in the Alderaanian consular security. He was serving aboard the Tantive IV as its second officer in 0 BBY.
            Toshma Jefkin[2] served in the Alderaanian consular security, a force responsible for guarding and escorting Alderaanian dignitaries.[3] Because the royal family of Alderaan was secretly affiliated with the Rebel Alliance,[4] Jefkin himself was involved in the war against the Galactic Empire as a soldier of the Rebel Military.[2] By the year 0 BBY,[5] Jefkin served as second officer on the Tantive IV, a CR90 corvette commanded by Captain Raymus Antilles and used by Princess Leia Organa as her consular ship. By then, Jefkin and the captain had served together for years, sharing many close encounters with Imperial forces.[6]
            After it was damaged in a perilous mission, the Tantive IV was docked aboard the Rebel MC75 star cruiser flagship Profundity, where it underwent repairs.[7] However, the Profundity was sent to Scarif, where a team of Rebels attempted to steal the plans of the Empire's Death Star battle station. After the Profundity intercepted the rebel transmission of the Death Star plans, the redoubtable Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader boarded the cruiser. Having copied the stolen plans on a datacard, some crewmembers of the Profundity attempted to board the Tantive IV in time. The bearer of the the datacard, however, could not enter the corvette because of a jammed security door. On the other side of the door, Jefkin managed to get ahold of the precious device through a slight opening. Once in possession of the plans, he charged through the corridors of the Profundity until he reached the cruiser's docking bay and the entry hatch to the Tantive IV. The moment Jefkin boarded the corvette, he ordered the ship's launch.[1] Once the Tantive IV zoomed away, leaving the hangar behind, the security guard handed the datacard off to a woman who then took it to Captain Antilles.[2]
            His encounter with Vader, whose identity was unknown to him, left Jefkin deeply rattled. He recountered the incident shortly afterward in a meeting with the Tantive IV's senior officers and Organa as they tried to decide how to proceed with delivering the Death Star plans.[6]
            A male human, Jefkin had light skin and brown eyes.[1]
            As a member of the Alderaanian consular security, Jefkin carried a DH-17 blaster pistol and wore the traditional uniform, which featured a service helmet with flash visor and integral comlink and a multi-pocketed spacer vest of Corellian cut.[3]
            Toshma Jefkin was portrayed by Christopher Patrick Nolan in the 2016 Star Wars Anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. His role was confirmed in the movie's credits.[8] Nolan was at Pinewood Studios for four days, during additional photography and reshoots, and his part was filmed in three days.[9]
            The character's name was coined in Matt Forbeck's junior novelization of the movie.[2] With the approval of Jennifer Heddle and the Lucasfilm Story Group, Forbeck named the character in tribute to his friend Jeff Mackintosh, who had died of brain cancer in the fall of 2016[9] and was an Star Wars fan.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Toshma_Jefkin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascToshmaJefkin</string></dict>

A Jedi Watchman, Torles resided on Cartao as he watched over the Prackla sector for thirty standard years.
            Discovered to be Force-sensitive sometime after his birth in 94 BBY, Jafer Torles was taken to the Coruscant Jedi Temple's academy for training in the ways of the Force. After years of study at the academy and later as a Padawan, Torles constructed for himself a blue-bladed lightsaber and passed his Trials of Knighthood. A fully ranking Jedi Knight, Torles pursued the path of the Jedi Sentinel, and after years of independent study was appointed as Watchman of the Prackla sector in 51 BBY.[1]
            Residing on Cartao, Jedi Torles watched over the sector and interacting with its people in order to assure that he provided for them in the best way he could to suit their needs. A mediator and local arbiter, Torles was revered by the people of the region as the ultimate Jedi, a reputation Torles disliked and tried to discourage. One such admirer, the young Corf Binalie , idolized the Jedi all through his childhood. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Separatist leaders targeted Cartao. Invading the world, Torles led the opposition forces to defend the world's Spaarti Creations facility. When the Grand Army of the Republic reinforced Jedi Torles, he joined Commander Roshton and the double agent Kinman Doriana in trying to repel the Separatists. Tragically, in the aftermath of the battle a Republic gunship crashed into the main Spaarti Creations facility, destroying it and condemning the planet to economical death. When it was later learned that the Jedi Knights had apparently ordered the suicide mission, Torles found himself exiled and shunned by his old friends, including young Binalie. The old Jedi left the planet to return to Coruscant, vowing to identify and track down the Jedi who had ordered the strike.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jafer_Torles</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJaferTorles</string></dict>

        <key>Laurita Tohm</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.219.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Laurita Tohm was a male Human Imperial Cadet who graduated from the Raithal Academy on Coruscant and was promptly promoted to Lieutenant of the Galactic Empire. In 19 BBY, Tohm became involved in the Gentis coup, but unlike his classmates, he sided with Darth Vader and the wounded Emperor Palpatine, helping to save the latter by taking him to the Jedi prison known as The Prism. Having been promoted to the rank of Commander, he subsequently wrote a report on the incident. Impressed by his actions during the coup, the Emperor promoted him again to the rank of Admiral. Once Vader learned that Palpatine considered Tohm to be a worthy successor, however, he murdered the young Admiral, not willing to face him as a rival in the future.
            As a boy, Laurita Tohm lived with his extended family in a mining facility. His parents were tibanna gas miners, enlisting Tohm with small tasks. One day, during the Clone Wars, representatives of the Confederacy of Independent Systems came to the family's home and decided to destroy the facility. Tohm was lugging a tool kit when he discovered his parents tied to the gas mining equipment, explosives places around them. His mother told him to run, but in his shock, Tohm had barely turned away when the explosives went off. He lost his left arm all the way to the shoulder, as well as his left eye, and was scarred all along the side of his face and body. Both of his parents, his four brothers, his two aunts and three uncles, and nine cousins died in the attack as well, leaving Tohm orphaned and alone.
            Some time later, Tohm joined the Raithal Academy, never allowing his disabilities to slow him down. In 19 BBY, a few months after the rise of the Galactic Empire, Tohm graduated from the Academy at the top of his class. Though he was teased by his fellow cadets, such as his friends Shens and Caul Gentis, his constant studying was what propelled him to the role of valedictorian. The cadets came to the planet of Coruscant, part of six different academies from around the galaxy who came to the capital in order to be part of the first graduating class of Imperial officers. Their training—like that of the Empire's clones and other military personnel—had been accelerated from the usual years to only a few months. Many important Imperial figures were in attendance, including Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. General Gentis, hero of the Clone Wars and Tohm's personal hero, presided over the brief ceremonies, and awarded Tohm the rank of lieutenant for his excellence at the Academy. He took Tohm by the shoulder after promoting him and briefly asked him about how his deformities impacted his excellence, then told him to keep up his superior work.
            Tohm then attended a celebration gala at Shens and Caul's behest, though he was nervous about his appearance and claimed to want to do an analysis of the First Battle of Geonosis. Caul assured him that the young women in attendance wouldn't mind his looks, either focusing on his uniform or feeling sympathy for his condition. Tohm reluctantly agreed, thinking that at least he could meet superior officers during the event, but Headmaster Gentis surprised the trio, telling Tohm that his new assignment had already arrived. Tohm was to become a part of a secret project being undertaken by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's fleet, and Tarkin would be arriving within a week to collect all of his new recruits. Gentis then ordered Caul and Shens to make sure Tohm stayed out of harm's way—their first order as officers, and one that Tohm would not fully grasp until later.
            With drinks in hand, Caul and Shens brought Tohm to a nearby security center and revealed a platform full of prototype TIE/LN starfighters. Tohm balked at the idea of flying one, but Caul pointed out that Tohm, like the rest of them, always dreamed of being a pilot, and that he knew Tohm could fly the fighter. Tohm relented, believing that he could use the experience professionally, but once inside, the engines would not start. He looked to his friends, who could not meet his gaze, and they told him that this was done to keep him out of trouble for the night. Tohm demanded answers and that they let him free, but Shens had sliced the locking mechanism, and they told him that he'd be free in a few hours, and that everything would be over by then.
            Tohm initially assumed that they were playing a prank on him, not suspecting any other motives, yet determined to escape from the fighter nonetheless. He quickly and expertly engaged the ejection seat on the fighter, which launched him high above the cityscape—just in time to witness the true intentions of Gentis and his classmates.
            Explosions rocked the cityscape for kilometers around, eliminating seventy-two Imperial targets within minutes. The officer's club, various stormtrooper garrisons, the Comm Towers, and a supply depot were all destroyed. Tohm landed on Imperial Plaza, which had become ground zero in the battle that erupted, as "terrorist" forces swarmed through the city streets, fighting with the Empire's clone forces. The stormtroopers were losing the battle, and Tohm was saved by a stormtrooper who pulled him behind cover. The trooper demanded some sort of chain of command until Tohm pointed out the appearance of Darth Vader himself. Vader was leading stormtrooper reinforcements, cutting down their attackers on all sides with his lightsaber. As the terrorist forces fled, Vader threw a large piece of broken stone atop several enemy soldiers, crushing them beneath its weight. Tohm requisitioned a blaster from a trooper, then rushed into the battle, still not realizing the source of the attacks. One enemy, his body crushed, grabbed Tohm's ankle as he passed and asked for help. Tohm bent and removed the man's mask, revealing him to be his friend Shens. Shens told him that Gentis was orchestrating the attacks in an attempt to assassinate Palpatine, and asked Tohm to join them out of loyalty. He told Tohm that the coup was because Gentis knew that Palpatine would carelessly waste their lives in his warmongering, but Tohm demanded to know why he wasn't recruited. Shens told him that it was because he always stood out too much, but begged him to stand with them now and kill Lord Vader. Tohm thought for a brief moment, then told Shens he should have been asked earlier, before shooting his friend in the head.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Laurita_Tohm</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLauritaTohm</string></dict>

            Heff Tobber was initially stationed as a transport pilot at the Rebel outpost on the planet Crait. However, when the base was abandoned, the pilot ventured to the moon Yavin 4 and joined Blue Squadron. There, Tobber quickly became one of the most popular U-wing pilots with the infantry.

        <key>Tobin  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.223.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Colonel Tobin was a male Human officer in the Onderon military until 3951 BBY when he joined General Vaklu in his attempt to wrest control of Onderon from then Queen Talia. Despite an alliance with the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus, the revolution failed. Tobin was spared from death and forced to serve aboard Nihilus' flagship the Ravager. During the Battle of Telos IV, Meetra Surik boarded the Ravager, intent on destroying the ship and its master. There, she found Tobin and convinced him to help in the destruction.
            Before the Onderon Civil War in 3951 BBY, Tobin was the second in command of General Vaklu, who was the military leader of the Onderon military. Many Onderonians, including Tobin, believed that benefits with the planet's recent relationship with the Republic favored the interstellar government while Onderon's culture and resources faded. When Vaklu began to carry out his plan to overthrow his cousin and supporter of the Republic, Queen Talia, Tobin was responsible for provoking open conflict between Onderon and the Galactic Republic in order to instigate a civil war. At some point before the civil war broke out Sith Lord Darth Nihilus approached Vaklu, Tobin, and their supporters to offer his assistance in their endeavor.
            Tobin was informed by an unknown source about the upcoming arrival of the Ebon Hawk. The Ebon Hawk eventually did appear near Onderon, as Meetra Surik planned to search the planet for Jedi Master Kavar. Tobin then ordered his fighter pilots to attack the vessel, which forced Surik to hide in the jungles of Dxun, the nearby moon of Onderon. This event triggered a space battle between the Republic fleet and Vaklu's fleet and, practically, the Onderon Civil War itself.
            However, Tobin was not satisfied with the outcome, as he wanted to see the Ebon Hawk disintegrated. He reprimanded the captain who allowed the ship to escape and dispatched a group of scouts to Dxun to find Surik and her crew. Before the scouts could report anything, they were killed by Surik and the Mandalorian Kelborn.
            When Surik, with the help of the Mandalorian leader Canderous Ordo, breached Onderon's military blockade and managed to contact Master Kavar in the cantina of Iziz, Tobin personally arrived with a squad of Vaklu soldiers, hoping to capture both Jedi at once. Suddenly, Kavar stunned all of Tobin's soldiers with the Force, and Tobin left the cantina to pursue Kavar, who had escaped.
            Later, during the Second Battle of Onderon, Tobin commanded the strikeforce that infiltrated the Royal Palace, and while in the palace, killed a Twi'lek slicer named Kiph when he betrayed Vaklu and tried to escape. He used a drexl beast to disable the force field that guarded entrance to Queen Talia's throne room, planning to assassinate her. However, his plans were disrupted when the beast broke free of its handler, crushing everything in the hall, and incapacitated Tobin. Surik, who appeared in the palace just in time, left Tobin for dead while pursuing Vaklu and his soldiers to the throne room.
            Unlike Surik, Kreia realized that Tobin's injuries were not lethal. She decided to use him as a pawn in her own game against Darth Nihilus, the shadowy Sith Lord behind Vaklu and Tobin. She lied to the Colonel, telling him that many Jedi were hiding in Atris's secret academy on Telos IV. Tobin initially didn't believe her and fled the palace before the Royalist forces could capture him.
            Eventually he found himself before Darth Nihilus and informed him of the academy. In his hunger for the Force, the Sith Lord summoned his fleet to Telos, which started the Battle of Telos. During it, Surik once again crossed paths with Tobin aboard the Ravager, Nihilus's flagship. By that time, Tobin had been physically ravaged by the dark side energy aboard the ship, likely a result of Nihilus's hunger, shown by his now gaunt appearance.
            Tobin realized at last that Nihilus did not care for Onderon, and had he won the battle, it would be his next target. Still loyal to his homeworld, Tobin turned away from the Sith and agreed to help Surik and her Mandalorian allies destroy the ship, annoying Mandalore, who remarked, "We shouldn't waste our time with the weak," and promised Tobin that his men would shoot Tobin dead if the colonel were to "try anything stupid."
            As an alternative to persuading Tobin to abandon the Sith (which works only if the player has high persuasive skills), the player has an option to kill him or not to engage in conversation with him at all, if the latter is chosen then Tobin would die in the explosion that destroys the Ravager.
            Killing Tobin results in gaining "influence" with Mandalore while helping him "for Onderon" will result in an "influence" decrease, as described above.
            Aboard the Ravager, Tobin's dialogue options are the same regardless of whether the player sided with the Royalists and Queen Talia or the secessionists and General Vaklu.
            If Meetra Surik both speaks and acts supportively for General Vaklu prior to meeting Master Kavar in the cantina, then Tobin leading a team of soldiers in and attacking is not a real attempt to kill Surik again; it is a ruse. After Kavar flees back to the Royal Palace, Tobin shouts for the fighting to stop, and apologizes to Surik that "We have to maintain appearances." Attacking the Ebon Hawk when it first reached Onderon was not truly Tobin or Vaklu's choice; a Sith Lord they have allied with demanded they do it. Tobin explains the General is aware Surik has helped his cause, and that he wishes to break his current alliance with the Sith Lord and make a new one with Surik at the same time. If Surik accepts the offer, Tobin warns that for now Surik must leave Iziz and will be attacked on the way out by men loyal to Vaklu, so that the Sith "will be satisfied we are still loyal to them."</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tobin_(Human)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTobin</string></dict>

            Commander Shogar Tok captured a prison facility on Brentaal IV during the early stages of the Clone Wars, converting it into his base of operations. He rallied his people against the Galactic Republic, and established a military presence on the planet. This drew the attention of the Republic, and a task force was dispatched to retake Brentaal IV. Jedi Masters Plo Koon, Agen Kolar, and Shaak Ti led their troops against Tok's forces, though Count Dooku ordered Tok himself to remain away from the frontlines, secure within his fortress.
            However, in time, even Shogar Tok's headquarters were penetrated by the enemy. Jedi Master Shaak Ti confronted Tok in his command center, forcing the Zeltron murderer Lyshaa to seduce Tok and cloud his emotions. Though Lyshaa accomplished this, she betrayed Shaak Ti, shooting her in the stomach before the Jedi could order Tok to surrender. Lyshaa informed Shogar of Shaak Ti's intentions, gaining Tok's gratitude. However, Shaak Ti recovered from her wound, and engaged Tok in a fierce duel, with Ti using her lightsaber and Tok his vibro-ax, which was presumable made of one of the few lightsaber resistant metals.
            Despite her weakened condition, Shaak managed to best Shogar Tok, stabbing him through the gut with her lightsaber. Tok's fortress defenses were destroyed, and his leaderless troops were forced to surrender.

        <key>TK-422</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.225.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>TK-422 was the designation of a clone stormtrooper stationed aboard Death Star I during the Galactic Civil War. After the Millennium Falcon was captured, he was ordered to stand guard in front of the freighter's boarding ramp, while a scanning crew attempted to determine if anyone was hiding aboard the Falcon.
            Just seconds after the scanning crew had made their way up the boarding ramp, a loud thump was heard and someone called down to them, asking TK-422 and his fellow guard, TK-421, for help with a piece of equipment. The two stormtroopers made their way up the ramp to assist the then-unconscious technicians. Instead TK-422, along with TK-421, was stunned by Han Solo, stripped of his armor, tied up, and stowed in one of the Falcon's service lockers. His armor was then donned by Solo, who complained of the smell and speculated that TK-422 didn't wash himself regularly. His weapon was taken by Luke Skywalker.
            When a firefight broke out between the staff of Detention Block AA-23 and a Wookiee with two stormtroopers, a security team was dispatched to the hangar housing the recently captured freighter. TK-422 and his unconscious comrades were found aboard the Falcon. After attempts to revive him were unsuccessful, TK-422's fellow stormtroopers brought him to the nearest medical bay.

            At some point in 1 BBY, TK-421 went off-duty and went to the Star Tours interstellar travel agency for unknown reasons. His bag was eventually discovered by G2-9T during baggage checks, and upon learning of who it belonged to, decided that TK-421 might have good reason not to be at his regular post before clearing it.[4][5]
            After the Millennium Falcon was captured shortly before the Battle of Yavin, he was ordered to stand guard in front of the freighter's boarding ramp, while a scanning crew attempted to determine if anyone was hiding aboard the Falcon.[3]
            Just seconds after the scanning crew had made their way up the boarding ramp, a loud thump was heard and someone (Later revealed to be Han Solo) called down to them, asking TK-421 and his fellow guard, TK-422, for help with a piece of equipment. The two stormtroopers made their way up the ramp to assist the technicians; both troopers were ambushed by Han Solo and stripped of their armor to conceal Han and Luke's identities aboard the Death Star.[3]
            Lt. Pol Treidum (observing from Docking Control Room 327 that TK-421 was absent) attempted to contact the stormtrooper, asking (via comlink) why he wasn't stationed at his post. Luke Skywalker (having disguised himself as TK-421 by that time) concealed TK-421's current status by motioning to his ear to imply that the comlink in his helmet must be broken.[3]
            After the battle of Detention Block AA-23, a security team was dispatched to the hangar housing the Millennium Falcon where TK-421 and his comrades were found unconscious aboard the Freighter. He, along with TK-422 and the two crewmen were taken to the infirmary and perished in the Death Star's destruction during the battle of Yavin 4.
            In the novelization of the movie, and in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, the trooper was referred to as THX-1138, a homage to George Lucas's first feature film. In the radio drama, he was referred to as TX-421. In Star Wars 3: Death Star! the character is referred to as TX-421 and as part of Scanning crew BT-445. In the German synchronization of Episode IV, the trooper's designation is TK-241 instead of TK-421. In the video game Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, the character TK-664 is a direct reference to this character. In the game TK-421 is also the name of the player skin of a stormtrooper, selectable in multiplayer. In the Star Wars: Battlefront series, TK-421 is one of the random names given to Imperial bots.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/TK-421/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTK421</string></dict>
        <key>TK-119</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.228.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>TK-119 was a clone stormtrooper who was aboard the Galactic Empire's Death Star battlestation in 0 BBY. That year, a group of soon-to-be operatives of the Alliance to Restore the Republic infiltrated the Death Star to rescue one of its prisoners, Princess Leia Organa. Following the successful escape, the Princess and one of her rescuers, Luke Skywalker, went through the station's Central Core Shaft, where they found themselves trapped behind a blast door leading to a shaft. As the two were trapped on an overhang, with the controls for the bridge extension across the shaft disabled, TK-119 was among a trio of stormtroopers who attempted to shoot the pair with their E-11 blaster rifles. However, Skywalker returned fire, and managed to kill TK-119 when he shot the stormtrooper and caused him to fall down the shaft.
            The Human[3] male[5] TK-119 was a clone[4] who served the Galactic Empire as a stormtrooper during the Galactic Civil War, a conflict between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. By 0 BBY, he was aboard the Imperial Death Star battlestation.[1]
            That year, the Death Star was infiltrated by a group of soon-to-be members of the Alliance, consisting of Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Luke Skywalker, in an attempt to rescue one of the station's prisoners, Princess Leia Organa of the planet Alderaan. Skywalker escorted Organa to Docking Bay 327, the hangar bay that the group arrived in aboard the YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon. On the way to the hangar, the pair went through the Death Star's corridors, where they were spotted by a stormtrooper patrol, and were forced to take cover behind a blast door leading to the Death Star's Central Core Shaft. Attempting to prevent the stormtroopers from opening the door, Skywalker used his stolen stormtrooper E-11 blaster rifle to shoot out the control panel by the door, not realizing that he had destroyed the controls meant to extend a bridge across the chasm. As Skywalker and Organa found themselves stuck on a narrow overhang, TK-119 was part of a trio of stormtroopers who arrived on a higher overhang across from the pair, firing their E-11 blaster rifles at the Alliance operatives.[1] TK-119 was killed when Skywalker returned fire and managed to shoot him in the chestplate, causing TK-119 to fall screaming down the shaft.[1][2]
            As a stormtrooper, TK-119 was totally loyal to Emperor Palpatine. He unquestioningly followed orders, and was willing to sacrifice his life to complete a mission.[6]
            TK-119 wore full stormtrooper armor and wielded an E-11 blaster rifle.[1]
            TK-119 first appeared in the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope,[1] where he was portrayed by uncredited stunt coordinator Peter Diamond,[7] who fell only a short distance before being caught by a mattress.[2][8] His fall was accompanied by the Wilhelm scream sound effect, marking its first usage in the Star Wars films.[1] In 2002, TK-119 was first identified by name, and revealed to be a clone stormtrooper, in a card for the A New Hope set of Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Trading Card Game.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/TK-119</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTK119</string></dict>

            Tyrans would be one of the more vocal members of the Dread Masters. On Oricon, he would be the master mind behind the tactics used by the Dread Guard and Dread Host forces. When confronted in their Palace, Tyrans treated the encounter like a game, merely using the flooring of his sanctum as a means of making the battle more interesting and using its temporary placement as a means of removing his enemies 'from play'. Tyrans stated upon his 'defeat' that "It was but a game, the true test is to come."
            Tyrans was a master of Force attacks; unlike many of his fellow Dread Masters, he did not use any melee strikes. His Thundering Blast, Shock, and Death Mark were all powerful abilities in his arsenal and as such were not to be underestimated. Tyrans' Death Mark would cause his opponent to wither and die over the course of a few seconds, meaning it was one of his most powerful and deadly abilities.
            The strike team confronted him again in the inner sanctum with the remaining Dread Masters. During the fight, Brontes and Styrak were brought back as apparitions, but were both dispatched by the strike team. Tyrans in particular reeled in shock upon witnessing Styrak's defeat. Soon afterwards, he fell along with the other Dread Masters.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrans</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTyrans</string></dict>
        <key>Rufaan Tigellinus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.232.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rufaan Tigellinus was a Grand Admiral and later a Grand Moff of the Galactic Empire until his death in 5 ABY. Known for his political savvy and charisma, Tigellinus was widely followed in the media and was considered to be a key player in Imperial Court politics. Already a respected fleet admiral, he was made a Grand Admiral in 2 BBY and, from the helm of his Star Destroyer, Avatar, spent much time rooting out pirates in the Outer Rim Territories. During the Galactic Civil War, Tigellinus stepped up in the Imperial Court in a bid for further power, allying himself with the likes of Moff Vilim Disra and Imperial Advisor Alec Pradeux, and becoming a member of the ancient, exclusive Order of the Canted Circle. When Thrawn, an alien admiral in the Imperial Navy, tried his hand at Imperial Court politics, the Humanocentric Grand Admiral Tigellinus befriended and later betrayed him, until Thrawn was unwelcome in the Empire.
            Soon thereafter, Tigellinus brought his political clout to bear in order to have himself appointed as Grand Moff of the Imperial Center Oversector with the help of Vilim Disra, who became something of a mentor to Tigellinus. After Emperor Palpatine perished at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Tigellinus became involved with the Central Committee of Grand Moffs. The Committee's leader, Bertroff Hissa, a near-Human with whom Tigellinus had frequently butted heads, presented Tigellinus with a demeaning offer—a place on the Committee but not the leadership many had expected he would be awarded—hoping that he would refuse and give Hissa an excuse to execute him. Tigellinus prepared to accept the offer, but his close friend Disra advised against this; Tigellinus refused the appointment, and the Committee executed him for perceived disloyalty, while Disra laid claims to his assets and seat on the Committee.
            A Human male, Rufaan Tigellinus was a charismatic member of the Imperial Court, well known among the media,[1] and a respected strategist who served as a fleet admiral in the Imperial Navy for many years.[3] In 2 BBY, during New Year Fete Week, Emperor Palpatine created the rank of Grand Admiral, appointing Tigellinus and eleven others to his "Circle of Twelve."[1] Tigellinus' reputation was such that his appointment met with little argument from those in the Galactic Empire.[3] The Grand Admiral used his new power to further his position within the Imperial Court, gaining a large following.[1]
            Tigellinus commanded the Star Destroyer Avatar during the years preceding the Battle of Yavin. Around this time, he attempted to apprehend the Poss'Nomin pirate Reginald Barkbone, who had been plundering many star systems from the Outer Rim Territories to the Colonies. Tigellinus and Avatar chased Barkbone through many sectors, though the pirate's Star Galleon, Robber Baron, was able to escape each time. In his ship's log, Tigellinus vowed to kill Barkbone; the log was later sent to Grand Vizier Sate Pestage as part of an Imperial Security Bureau report compiled by Commander Maximillian Seerdon. Around that same time, an alien named Thrawn joined the Imperial Navy, earning the rank of captain. Tigellinus, a firm believer in Humanocentrism, despised Thrawn, and began looking for ways to get rid of him.[4]
            Several months after the disastrous Battle of Yavin, Tigellinus started to become a major player in Imperial Court politics on Coruscant.[2] He established an alliance with Alec Pradeux, an Imperial Advisor who was thought to be close to Palpatine, and forged a sizable faction in a short span of time. In late 1 ABY, Tigellinus attempted to win support for his protégé, Gerald Weizel, to become the governor of the planet Chandrila. On 1:9:4 ABY, the media reported that Weizel had won the backing of Moff Jamson Caglio; this was an important event in Tigellinus' rise, as Caglio had been a firm supporter of Tigellinus' rival faction, that of Grand Moff Traeda, and winning his support was seen as a large step toward the center of power. Around the same time, Tigellinus attempted to recruit Moff Vilim Disra, a man with many ties to Traeda but who had recently fallen out of favor with Palpatine, into his faction. The media kept a close watch on the situation, and journalist Alendar Jarvis of the New Order Progressive published a report on Tigellinus' progress.[5]
            Tigellinus, along with Traeda and Moff Jaan, officiated the festivities of that year's New Year Fete Week in Palpatine's absence, since the Emperor was away on Imperial business in the Deep Core.[5] Shortly thereafter, Thrawn, now an admiral, entered Imperial politics. Tigellinus still harbored a deep hatred for non-Humans and resented Thrawn's encroaching on his territory; he befriended the alien admiral, with the intention of later betraying him.[1]
            Around six months later, Tigellinus was inducted into the Order of the Canted Circle, an elite, ancient, and highly exclusive social organization. The Order rarely took on more than eleven members at any one time, but Tigellinus was the thirteenth member added since 5 BBY, so his invitation was a surprise to the media. It was a testament to Tigellinus' rising stature that he was selected to join ahead of swaths of prospective members, each revered leaders of the Imperial government, most of whom had been waiting for an invitation for several years. Tigellinus wore the traditional black velvet robe of the Order during his public induction ceremony at the Skydome Botanical Gardens; later that evening, a private ceremony was held in an undisclosed location, and Tigellinus became a fully-fledged member of what was considered one of the most prestigious social clubs in the galaxy.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rufaan_Tigellinus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRufaanTigellinus</string></dict>

        <key>Booster Terrik</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.234.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Booster Terrik, a Human male from Corellia, was a smuggler and the only civilian ever known to own and operate an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, the Errant Venture. He was the father of Mirax Terrik, and grandfather of Valin and Jysella Horn.
            Booster Terrik's childhood began on Corellia. As sure as young Booster was anything, he was independent—though his earliest work, honest or otherwise, involved piloting freighters for large corporations, he soon resolved to start his own shipping ventures, independent of anyone's authority but his own. The result was something less than outright success: more than one of his enterprises were quickly driven into the ground, and Terrik soon found himself burdened with enormous debts and no legal way to ensure his continued survival.
            Running from a team of bounty hunters in the freighter Starwayman—which he had been forced to steal to effect his getaway—Terrik ended up on the Outer Rim Territories planet Borlov, where he would experience the first of many odd turns of luck. He encountered an avian Borlovian noble, Llollulion, who was intrigued by stories of Terrik's haphazard lifestyle. Something of a rogue amongst his own introverted species, Llollulion longed to escape Borlov and see the galaxy, and Terrik seemed to be the perfect means toward that end. He used his extensive fortune to pay off Terrik's debtors—and purchase Starwayman outright—on the condition that Terrik take him on as a copilot. Happy for the company, and grateful for the financial assistance, Terrik agreed. While the Separatist Crisis was making headlines on the galactic scene, Terrik and Llollulion began a life of steady, if less-than-reputable, work as smugglers.[1]
            The law would eventually catch up to them, however, and Llollulion found himself locked up in the CoCo District Constabulary on Coruscant, held on various smuggling-related charges.[2] Thanks to a daring escape alongside Human con men Achk Med-Beq and Dannl Faytonni, the Galactic Republic never got a chance to try the Borlovian, and with the Clone Wars breaking out in full scant days afterward, the government suddenly had more important things to worry about.
            Though he was every bit as adventurous as Terrik, Llollulion would come to play the role of Terrik's conscience as the Clone Wars tore the galaxy in half. Starwayman soon found itself running supplies for early dissenters—presumably tied to the Separatists—throughout the Outer Rim, and though Terrik claimed to have only his business interests at heart, in truth he was no happier with the steady consolidation of power under Supreme Chancellor Palpatine than was his copilot.
            Scarcely a week after the defeat of General Grievous and the declaration of the New Order, Terrik and Llollulion were making a supply run to insurgents on Kobbahn when the Victory-class Star Destroyer Strikefast, under the command of Captain Voss Parck ambushed them. Starwayman made a series of jumps into the edge of the Unknown Regions in the hopes of shaking the Imperials, but Parck, eager to be rid of what he saw as a tedious assignment, would not be shaken. As a desperate last-minute gamble, Terrik took his ship to ground on a nearby planet, hoping to hide amidst the unnamed world's dense jungle. Parck continued his pursuit, and would certainly have captured Starwayman were it not for the intervention of a mysterious alien - a Chiss male who would later be known as Thrawn. Who had been marooned on the island years earlier. Viewing the alien's tactical genius as a far more important prize than a couple of two-bit smugglers, Parck packed up his forces and left without a second thought, leaving Terrik to wonder at his continued good fortune.[1]
            Over the next several years, Terrik would continue doing business for the rebels—and profiting heavily from it—but everything else in his life would soon change. Undoubtedly the biggest change was his marriage to a woman named Jysella and the subsequent birth of his daughter, Mirax. Now that he had a family to take care of, Terrik abandoned his nomadic ways and began using Corellia as his base of operations. Llollulion, however, was not done seeing the galaxy, and the two parted ways. It is possible that Llollulion took Starwayman with him upon his departure—the ship was legally his, after all—because around this time Terrik acquired a new ship, the Baudo-class star yacht Pulsar Skate;[1] as well as a new copilot, the tentacled alien Polipe.
            Just when things were leveling out for Terrik, however, his wife met a sudden end. Finding himself solely responsible for Mirax's welfare, Terrik had to rethink the way he conducted business; having a stationary base of operations already made it easier for the authorities to keep track of him, and the last thing Terrik wanted was CorSec showing up at his door and taking Mirax away while he was off on a job. Luckily, he had good friends in Jagged and Zena Antilles, the couple who operated Corellia's Gus Treta orbital refueling station. He often left Mirax in the Antilles's care during smuggling runs, though just as often, he would bring Mirax and the Antilles's son Wedge along for the ride. Spending many of their young years in each other's company, Mirax and Wedge would become good friends; Terrik and the Antilles began to regard each other's children as if they were their own. When Gus Treta was destroyed by careless pirates in a hurried escape from the system, Terrik loaned Wedge, who had been onboard Pulsar Skate at the time, a Z-95 Headhunter, making no move to stop Wedge from exacting revenge for his parents' deaths.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Booster_Terrik</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBoosterTerrik</string></dict>

Fearless and highly motivated, Terrik was willing to sacrifice as many troops as he felt necessary in order to achieve his objectives.

            When he was assigned to Tatooine in search of missing droids C-3PO and R2-D2, Terrik was captain of the Desert Sands Zeta Squadron. He ordered and supervised attacks on a Jawa sandcrawler. Following the tracks of sandcrawler, they soon moved to the Lars homestead.

        <key>Terex</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.236.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Terex was a human male who served as a stormtrooper designated TK-603 in the Galactic Empire. In the years following the Battle of Jakku, Terex became the leader of a crime syndicate on Kaddak known as the Ranc gang. Still determined to rebuild the Empire, Terex joined the First Order, an Imperial remnant that had relocated to the Unknown Regions. By 34 ABY, Terex had become an agent in the First Order's Security Bureau. During the early phase of the cold war, Terex fought the Resistance starfighter pilot Poe Dameron and his Black Squadron. Terex also blackmailed the Resistance technician Oddy Muva into spying on Poe and Black Squadron by holding his wife Sowa Chuan captive.
            After being bested by Poe on Ovanis and Megalox Beta, Terex embarked on a rogue mission to destroy the Resistance. Terex retook control of the Ranc gang and tried to destroy Poe and the Resistance. However, he was outsmarted by Black Squadron a third time. Following his failed bid to destroy the Resistance, Terex was arrested by Commander Malarus and brought back to the First Order for punishment. While Terex was condemned to the mines, he managed to convince Captain Phasma of his loyalty to the First Order. As a result, he was given a second chance and was fitted with a cyborg construct.
            During the Galactic Civil War, Terex, designated TK-603, was a stormtrooper of the Galactic Empire.[3] He learned that ambition was forbidden, and that conformity was everything.[1] TK-603 was stationed at the Rothana Imperial Shipyards during the last years of the Galactic Civil War. He guarded the base and knew how to access its security codes. During the Battle of Jakku, Terex was pulled from sentry duty to bolster up the frontline assault squads. TK-603 ended up on the same team with a man named Corlac, who answered to the call designation "TK-605". The Battle of Jakku was the last major battle of the Galactic Civil War which brought the end of the Old Empire.[4]
            After seeing the devastation of the Imperial fleet, TK-603 expressed disbelief at the Empire's defeat while his squadmate TK-605 remarked that it was the Empire's end. When their corporal ordered them to fight to the last, TK-605 shot him dead. When TK-603 protested, TK-605 responded that he did not feel like fighting to the last man and asked TK-603 if he agreed. When TK-603 asked what their orders were, TK-605 responded that there was no one left to give orders because the Empire had thrown everything they had against the New Republic and lost. TK-605 began to remove his stormtrooper armor in order to evade the New Republic. Despite his misgivings, TK-603 obliged.[3]
            As they began burying their armor, TK-605 introduced himself as Corlac and asked TK-605 what was his name. When Terex responded that his callsign was TK-603, Corlac chastised him for refusing to accept that the Empire was gone. Terex reluctantly introduced himself and remarked that it was a long time that he had thought of his old identity. After burying their armor, they decided to hide until night and then try to find a settlement. Corlac proposed that they find some work and figure a way offworld. Terex replied that it was difficult for him to leave his armor behind since they had been trained to treat the armor as part of themselves but surmised it was now trash. Corlac complimented Terex for realizing this fact.[3]
            Terex and Corlac spent about a year on Jakku building an "Ugly" out of the head of an AT-AT walker, a pair of S-foils, and a pair of TIE Interceptor wings. While Corlac wanted to head into the Outer Rim Territories and link up with his criminal contacts, Terex was determined to rejoin the Imperial remnants and put down the Republic. Corlac convinced Terex to focus on building underworld contacts first. Terex agreed to leave Jakku but not before retrieving his stormtrooper armor and uniform.[3]
            While departing Jakku, Terex expounded that the Empire stood for law and order and opined that they could not abandon it. He and Corlac traveled to the Outer Rim planet of Kaddak, which was then a remote outpost.[3] At a cantina on Kaddak, Corlac introduced Terex to two female pirates named Wenda and Bett. Corlac told Terex that Wenda and Bett were going to help them to restore the Empire. The four hatched a plan to commandeer an Imperial shipyards at Rothana by using Terex's knowledge of the base to bypass its security. They would then use the base's resources to build a new Imperial fleet.[4] However, Corlac, Wenda, and Bett secretly had no intention of reviving the old Empire. Their true plan was to use the fleet to start a criminal empire and kill Terex should he refuse to join them.[7]
            At the Rothana Imperial shipyards, Terex, Corlac, and the pirates were sealed up in the repair bay. After several attempts, Terex managed to bypass the shipyard's security.[4] After the pirates had taken control of the shipyards, Terex discovered the late Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's flagship Carrion Spike. While repairing the ship, he overheard Corlac, Wenda, and Betta planning to kill him. After learning of their treachery, Terex uses the Carrion Spike's weapons systems to obliterate the control station where they were meeting, killing Corlac and the two pirates. When the other pirates including Wisper and Zumgi confronted Terex, he told them that he now accepted that the Empire was gone forever and took control of the gang.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Terex</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTerex</string></dict>

        <key>Tharan Cedrax</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.238.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dr.Tharan Cedrax was a male Human slicer companion to a Jedi Knight who he met on Nar Shaddaa during the Cold War. Cedrax was a great healer, a ranged attacker, and with the help of his holographic assistant Holiday, he could stun enemies. Cedrax was a cunning, clever gambler on Nar Shaddaa, a charming playboy, and a specialized technology slicer.
            Born on Anaxes, Tharan Cedrax was a self-professed genius and a skilled exo-technologist. Having attended the University of Corellia briefly, he found himself blacklisted from their rolls when his devotion to studies waned in favor of building devices for fun. Traveling to Nar Shaddaa, Cedrax opened an office where he conducted his unique business of developing new technologies based on extra-galactic devices to satisfy wealthy and eccentric clients. Among his unique devices, Cedrax developed a sentient, holographic companion he named Holiday and with whom he lived and socialized. Becoming well known as a ladies' man and a playboy gambler, he was also respected for solving the baffling M'raki Uplink Paradox and designing Shadow Town prison. And despite being barred entry from the Star Cluster Casino, the Lyris Lounge and Reeder's Droid Warehouse, Cedrax had friends among the Jedi Order. After assisting Jedi Masters Syo Bakarn and Duras Fain early in the Cold War as they tracked an Imperial fugitive, Cedrax counted both among his list of friends, selling devices to the Jedi High Council for a fair price.
            When Jedi Master Fain began showing signs of psychosis and started to amass weapons and followers under the banner of the Guiding Hand, Cedrax was considered by Master Bakarn as a good place for the Jedi Knight assigned to track Fain to find information. Locating the exo-technologist dealing with a Nikto gang leader, the Knight drove off the unruly Nikto thugs and filled Cedrax in on the situation with Fain. Using his connection with the Red Light Lancers, a gang of tech-specialists within the Guiding Hand, Cedrax was able to help the Knight infiltrate the group. Arranging a meeting with the Lancers' leader Klage, Cedrax communicated with the Knight in secret to guide them through the gang's headquarters. When faced with having to pass an initiation test requiring a terrorist attack against the Hutt Cartel, Cedrax provided the Jedi with stolen Sith access codes which would pin the attack on the Empire, not the Republic. While the Jedi took care of infiltrating the Cartel's facilities, an agent for the Hutts came searching for answers to reports of Jedi coming and going from Cedrax's offices. While the Jedi was able to distract the guard and convince him that the Jedi was not involved in the attacks, Cedrax urged the Knight to move more swiftly. Equipping the Jedi with an anti-mind control device for use against Fain, Cedrax and Holiday pledged their support to the Consular after Fain was cured and returned to Tython.
            During the course of his travels with the Consular, his hard work paid off, and he was invited to a symposium at the Lumenatus Club, a secret society of the galaxy's greatest scientific geniuses. The invitation came in form of an anonymous package delivered to Barsen'thor's Defender-class light corvette, which contained a letter of Flimsiplast sealed inside a glass capsule. The letter contained a chemical formula of a gas, which when put in the capsule caused a real message to appear on its inside. Tharan decided to prepare for the symposium by assembling and presenting the functioning Vandrayk Generator, a theorized machine first proposed by the Arkanian Gorman Vandrayk during the Old Sith Wars. The Generator was supposed to run on a form of energy which did not exist at the time. However, after assembling the generator and realizing that his invention would only work for a minute, after which its invaluable core would burn out, Cedrax dismantled his creation, instead using the generator's core to increase the sentience of his holographic partner Holiday. He still attempted to present the generator at the symposium, but the core predictably did not work, making Cedrax a laughing-stock.
            Cedrax was a calm, but sarcastic, man who almost always sought rational answers to conflicts. He had a firm belief that knowledge was morally neutral and always desirable to keep, which sometimes put him in conflict with the Consular if a fantastic weapon or forbidden science project had to be destroyed for the greater good. He also disliked overt or unnecessary displays of Force abilities, especially the Jedi mind trick. Cedrax considered himself a pacifist, but the realities of life on Nar Shaddaa meant that he was proficient with a scattergun and a blaster. Much of the time, however, he used his technological wizardry to heal to Consular in battle or deployed Holiday as a distraction.
            In addition to his passion for science, Cedrax also enjoyed fine luxuries and the attention of beautiful women. He did not form lasting relationships, as his true emotional attachment was to Holiday, and she was easily spurred to jealousy.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tharan_Cedrax</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTharanCedrax</string></dict>
        <key>Treuten Teradoc</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.239.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Treuten Teradoc was a male Human officer of the Imperial Navy who established himself as an independent warlord during the breakup of the Galactic Empire after the Battle of Endor. After Emperor Palpatine's death at Endor, the Empire became directionless, and with no orders coming from Coruscant Teradoc claimed dominion over the Greater Maldrood, a region of territory surrounding his headquarters on Centares and the Maldrood sector where he had been stationed. The Er'Kit native Teradoc secured a number of key resource worlds around his new kingdom, but his proximity to the breakaway empire of Grand Moff Zsinj brought him into a rivalry with his fellow warlord. Border skirmishes with Zsinj and checks on expansion by the New Republic kept Teradoc occupied over the next several years, and the New Republic's expansion into the Empire left the warlord isolated. For a brief time Teradoc provided assistance to the former steward of the Empire Ysanne Isard, following her downfall. Teradoc eventually combined his Mid Rim holdings with the Deep Core territory ruled by his brother Kosh into what they called the Federated Teradoc Union.
            When Zsinj was killed at the Battle of Dathomir, Teradoc moved to acquire his former worlds, but soon found himself caught in a war with Teren Rogriss of the Empire and Gial Ackbar of the New Republic. New Republic forces closed in on his territory and Teradoc was forced to flee into the Deep Core and reestablish himself there with his massive military. After ignoring the efforts of Grand Admiral Thrawn to reunite Imperial factions, Teradoc was drawn in by a new power rising on Byss—the reborn Emperor Palpatine, acting in secret. With Teradoc and his fellow warlords and Imperial factions, the reunited Empire under Palpatine waged an extremely successful war against the New Republic, lasting until Palpatine's final death and the destruction of Byss. Teradoc, in control of the largest military of the warlords, returned to his kingdom, and was able to recruit Vice Admiral Gilad Pellaeon to lead his Crimson Command. Teradoc was soon drawn into conflict with the Deep Core warlord Blitzer Harrsk, who was making moves to increase his own power. Teradoc and Harrsk's private war was brought to a halt by the maneuverings of Admiral Natasi Daala, who joined with Pellaeon to force the warlords to come to the negotiation table. Daala summoned Teradoc, Harrsk, and eleven other of the most powerful Deep Core warlords to a conference at Tsoss Beacon. When they were unable to come to an agreement, Daala had all thirteen warlords, including Teradoc, killed.
            Born into a lower-class family on the planet Er'Kit, Treuten Teradoc had a rival almost from birth in his younger brother, Kosh. Although they rarely got along, the Teradoc brothers both always dreamed of action and adventure—to make these dreams a reality, they both signed up for the Imperial Navy. The Teradoc brothers both studied at the Imperial Academy at Corulag, where they distinguished themselves as naval theorists. Fiercely competing with one another at every turn, the Teradoc brothers both gained the rank of captain at about the same time, and were assigned to Crimson Command—a rapid-response taskforce active in the Quelii Oversector comprised of one hundred Victory-class Star Destroyers with distinctive red havod alloy hulls. The sibling rivalry soon took a different turn, however, when Treuten Teradoc was promoted to High Admiral over his brother Kosh, a development that Treuten never failed to rub in his brother's face.[1]
            By the time of the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Teradoc was stationed in the Maldrood sector. When Emperor Palpatine was killed in the battle, the Empire became rudderless, and immediately after, Admiral Blitzer Harrsk took his fleet into the Deep Core to establish an independent warlord kingdom. With no orders coming from Coruscant, Teradoc followed suit only days later.[3] Teradoc set his sights on the Mid Rim, offering several Imperial worlds protection from his Crimson Command and adding their planetary militias to his growing forces. After placing Grand Moff Ambris Selit under house arrest, Teradoc carved out his own kingdom[1] that he titled the Greater Maldrood, and established his headquarters and capital on the planet Centares. Styling himself High Admiral, Teradoc moved up and down the Perlemian Trade Route to secure more systems for himself, taking the shipyards at Abhean and Thanos, the industrial planets of Belderone, Charros IV, Metalorn, and Roche, the trade center of Bimmisaari, and the critical agriworld Balamak. With a wealth of resources under his control, Teradoc was able to keep his empire self-sufficient.[3][4]
            Teradoc wasted no time getting comfortable, growing fat in his ship's galley and generally avoiding any kind of combat. Teradoc scored a major coup when he stole the immense treasure stockpile of Space Station Scardia—Teradoc soon began to style himself as a swashbuckling rogue, wielding a cutlass as he paced his flagship, the 13X.[1] Though he remained nominally loyal to the Empire for the time being,[5] Teradoc promised protection under his aegis to the wealthier citizens of the Empire, undermining the authority of the head of the Empire at the time, Sate Pestage.[6] After Pestage's downfall, former Imperial Moff Leonia Tavira joined Teradoc, and from him obtained the Invidious, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer that had been with his fleet since Endor.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Treuten_Teradoc</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTreutenTeradoc</string></dict>
        <key>Nils Tenant</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.240.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nils Tenant was a human male who served as a rear admiral in the naval forces of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. When the war came to an end and Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine of the Republic anointed himself Emperor, Tenant continued serving in the navy of the new Galactic Empire as an admiral. Through the influence of his friend Wilhuff Tarkin, Tenant was eventually elevated to the Joint Chiefs of the Imperial Military in the sixth year of Palpatine's reign.
            In his youth, the human male called Nils Tenant attended the Sullust Sector Spacefarers Academy, the graduates of which moved on to positions in local system navies, commercial piloting, or the Judicial Department of the Galactic Republic. During his time at the academy, he befriended Wilhuff Tarkin, an Eriaduan who had previously worked with the Outland Regions Security Force.[2] Eventually, Tenant joined the naval forces of the Republic. As a navy officer, he was involved in the Clone Wars, a three-year long conflict that pitted the Republic against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.[1]
            At some point during the war, Tenant reached the rank of Rear Admiral and was put in command of a Venator-class Star Destroyer.[2] While patrolling the Chrelythiumn system, far beyond the Outer Rim of the galaxy, Tenant and his crew intercepted a mysterious transmission. When it transpired that the message contained a distress code abandoned by the Jedi Order more than 2,000 years earlier, the admiral transmitted said message to the planet Coruscant, where the Jedi High Council had its headquarters. The Council subsequently sent a party to investigate the source of the transmission.[1]
            After the Clone Wars ended, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine of the Republic declared himself Emperor, abolishing the democratic government and replacing it with his Galactic Empire. Nils Tenant continued to serve in the new Imperial starfleet, now with the rank of admiral, and was assigned to pacification missions for a time. In the fifth year of Palpatine's reign, Tenant was called back to Coruscant, where he would attend a Joint Chiefs meeting. On that occasion, he was reunited with his friend Wilhuff Tarkin. In the aftermath, the shakeups in the Imperial Military led to Tenant being elevated to the Joint Chiefs due to Tarkin's influence.[2]
            Nils Tenant was a fair-skinned, brown-haired man. He had a prominent nose, blue eyes, and a downturning full-lipped mouth.[1]
            As a veteran of the Clone Wars, Tenant disliked his pacification missions and yearned to be reintegrated back into active service. Although his friend Wilhuff Tarkin considered him genuinely competent, Tenant would not hesitate to use his connection to gain the Emperor's favor. The admiral's audacity was ultimately rewarded when he was made Joint Chief.[2]
            Tenant first appeared in the newsreel prelude to "Overlords," the fifteenth episode in Season Three of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series,[1] which aired on January 28, 2011. Although he went unnamed on screen, the online guide to the episode identified him as "Tenant."[3] His first name and whereabouts during the Imperial period were revealed in Tarkin,[2] a novel by James Luceno, released on November 4, 2014.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nils_Tenant</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNilsTenant</string></dict>

Finn and Tico ultimately escaped Canto Bight with the help of Blagg and his fellow urchins, who released the fathiers from the stables, resulting in the animals stampeding through the city and escaping into the desert.[2]
            Following the Battle of Crait, Blagg and the other stable hands listened as another urchin, Oniho Zaya, regaled them with tales of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and how he stood alone against the First Order on Crait. He resumed his duties shortly afterward, sweeping the floor of the stables. By then he concealed a Resistance ring,[2] a Galactic Civil War-era antique formerly owned by Tico.[3] While staring at the stars, Blagg—who dreamed of a better life away from Canto Bight—telekinetically lifted his broom with the power of the Force.[2]

        <key>Telettoh</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.243.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Telettoh was a Human male who served as a captain in the Galactic Republic's Navy during the Mandalorian Wars. In 3963 BBY, he became the official naval liaison to the Revanchist faction of Jedi after the Jedi Council allowed the Jedi Knight Revan and his followers to join the Republic's effort in the war against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. After meeting the former Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick and his companions on the planet Wor Tandell, Telettoh aided the Republic Admiral Saul Karath in the capture of the Republic fugitive Dace Golliard. He eventually ascended to the position of admiral in the Navy.
            Telettoh, a Human male, lived during the time period after the end of the Great Sith War. During his life, he joined the Navy of the Galactic Republic, and eventually became the captain of the Hammerhead-class cruiser Testament. In the year 3963 BBY, he became the official liaison to the Revanchists, the Jedi Knight Revan's faction of Jedi, who were organized under the banner of a Republic Mercy Corps. Telettoh was placed under the command of Jedi Knight and General Malak. Telettoh traveled to the planet Wor Tandell with Malak—who hoped to recruit his friend Jarael to the Revanchists—and the Cathar Jedi Ferroh.[1]
            After landing in the capital city of Gantra Lea, Telettoh was introduced by Ferroh to the former Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick, who was a companion of Jarael's. After the Cathar and the former Jedi conversed about the Revanchists' standing in the war, Telettoh, Ferroh, and Carrick made their way via swoops to the latter's camp based near his ship, the Hot Prospect. As they neared the camp, the three witnessed Malak engaging in a fight with[1] the Mandalorian scientist Demagol, who was secretly masquerading as the Mandalorian commander Rohlan Dyre.[2] Telettoh, who was aware of the Mandalorian's high profile due to his recent victory in the Tandem Open sporting event, helped Ferroh restrain Malak. The Republic captain berated Malak for attacking "Dyre," reasoning that the Revanchists could not afford any scandals. After Malak had a conversation with Carrick and Jarael, during which the latter turned down the Jedi's offer, Telettoh departed the planet aboard the Testament with Malak and Ferroh.[1]
            Eventually, the Republic Defense Ministry received an anonymous tip about a full-scale Mandalorian raiding force set to arrive in the Ottega system. Telettoh and his command ship Testament traveled to the system as part of a Republic force under the Republic Admiral Saul Karath's direction. The Republic ships waited for a Mandalorian fleet led by Cassus Fett to exit hyperspace outside of the system's asteroid field. After the Mandalorians exited hyperspace, the Republic forces prepared to engage them; however, the Mandalorian ships went around the fleet and re-entered hyperspace. Saul Karath was then notified by Zayne Carrick, who was in the system to contact Karath to ask him a favor, that pirates led by Republic fugitive Dace Golliard—who aimed to capture and enslave any survivors of the prospective battle—were near the starboard flank of Karath's command ship Swiftsure. After aiding in the capture of Golliard, Telettoh was instructed by Karath to take Carrick to wherever he and his companions needed to go.[3]
            As they were in transit to the planet Osadia, Telettoh had a discussion with Carrick, Marn Hierogryph, and the actual Rohlan Dyre—who, after Carrick and Hierogryph figured out that Demagol had been masquerading as Dyre, escaped Republic authorities with Carrick and Hierogryph's aid[2]—regarding the actual details of the Revanchist Jedi's involvement in the Mandalorian Wars. He explained that the Jedi Council had not sanctioned the Revanchist's participation with the Republic,[3] even after Revan found proof of the Mandalorians' devastation of the planet Cathar.[1] The captain informed Carrick and his companions that Revan organized his followers under the banner of a Republic Mercy Corps, leading to the Council sanctioning the Revanchist's participation in the war. Telettoh then gave Dyre, whom he knew as "Spikes," a tour of the Testament,[3] before arriving at Osadia.[4]
            Eventually, Telettoh was elevated to the rank of admiral in the Republic Navy. Millennia later, in 1032 BBY, Telettoh's Maxim, an ancient Republic protocol which banned the transport of Sith Lords aboard Republic vessels, was recited by the mercenary Jarrow Rusher when he was chiding the Jedi Knight Kerra Holt for bringing the Sith Quillan aboard his ship.[5]
            Telettoh was quick to put a halt to the fight between Malak and Rohlan Dyre, and even berated the Jedi for attacking the Mandalorian, believing that news of the fight would create indignity for the Revanchists.[1] He made a point of revealing the actual events of the Revanchist's involvement with the Republic war effort to Carrick and his companions, and believed that Revan was clever for organizing his followers under the banner of a Republic Mercy Corps.[3] He had light skin and blond hair, and wore a Republic officer's uniform, and donned a set of spectacles.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Telettoh</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTelettoh</string></dict>

        <key>Telvar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.245.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Telvar was a human male who represented the Galactic Empire as ambassador to Mon Cala during the early years of Emperor Sheev Palpatine's reign. After fruitless negotiations with King of Mon Cala Lee-Char in 18 BBY, Telvar boarded a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle which subsequently exploded after takeoff from Dac City, leaving no survivors.
            Following the death of Telvar, the Empire launched an attack on Mon Cala, with one instance culminating in the Battle of Dac City. During the battle, King Lee-Char contacted Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, overall commander of the military operations on Mon Cala, to end hostilities, as they were not responsible for the death of Telvar. However near the end of the war on Mon Cala, Lee-Char's Jedi advisor revealed to Vader that he had killed Telvar as they fought in the Royal Command Bunker
            Telvar was a human male that during the early reign of the Galactic Empire, served as an Imperial ambassador to the Outer Rim world of Mon Cala. During his tenure as ambassador in 18 BBY, the King of Mon Cala, Lee-Char, undertook a new secret advisor, and Lee-Char became involved in precarious economic discussions with Telvar in Dac City to rearrange their trade proposal. During one of these negotiations, Telvar informed Lee-Char that the entire situation boiled down to whether or not Mon Cala wished to remain as part of the Empire. Lee-Char objected, pointing out that the trade proposal would allow the Empire to take Mon Cala's resources away until they were in poverty. Telvar insisted that the trade proposal allowed the Empire to protect Mon Cala, but was rebutted by Lee-Char by expressing that there were no enemies of the Empire and that the galaxy was at peace.[1]
            After the exchange, Telvar informed Lee-Char that he respected his position and that he would brief Lee-Char's concerns to his superiors, and in the meantime it could be considered that there could be an annual cap on kelpite strand beams shipments to the Empire, but continued by saying that Lee-Char's inflexibility would do no good, and stated that they were all on the same side. The Mon Calamari Raddus countered, stating that the battleship in orbit showed otherwise, though Lee-Char quickly suppressed Raddus' outburst. After the heated exchange, Telvar stated that he would take his leave, and that he looked forward to resuming discussions, insisting that they were on the same side and hoped that it would remain so. Telvar soon contacted the Sovereign to inform them that he would be returning to the vessel shortly, and that his negotiations were "unproductive, but on-going."[1]
            As Telvar returned to his Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, Lee-Char and Raddus observed, and conversed, stating that negotiations did not go well. Raddus continued, describing Telvar as a "pompous dryskin fool", communicating that he held all the cards, and exclaimed that Mon Cala should secede from the Empire, expressing that they receive no benefits from the Empire while it sought to take everything from Mon Cala. Lee-Char countered as they observed Telvar reaching the landing platform with his trooper escort, saying that he didn't believe that they were at the point of secession. As Raddus continued, they observed a black Zeta-class shuttle landing on another nearby landing platform. As the Inquisitorius, Darth Vader, and a group of elite Purge Troopers were greeted by Lee-Char's Chief of Security Gial Ackbar, Telvar boarded his shuttle. As Vader stated that they were hunting an enemy of the Empire and Ackbar responding by saying that there were no such enemies on Mon Cala and that the king was in peaceful trade negotiations, Telvar's shuttle had departed until it violently exploded mid-flight. As the shuttle fell into the ocean, Vader told Ackbar that he was mistaken.[1]
            In orbit aboard the Sovereign, Governor Wilhuff Tarkin was informed by a lieutenant that sensors detected the explosion of Telvar's shuttle shortly after takeoff, resulting in a total loss and leaving no survivors. Tarkin asked whether it was an attack, a sabotage, or a malfunction, with the lieutenant stating that the cause was unclear and were still in the process of gathering data. Tarkin ordered the lieutenant to inform Major Rantu to deploy landing craft on his authorization, and that Colonel Bergon and Commander Jordo were to commence their phases of the operation. Tarkin finished by stating that he hoped that there was another solution, but the Mon Calamari had foolishly chosen war.[1]
            Soon after, the Battle of Dac City erupted as Imperial forces were being deployed. All Terrain Armored Transports and All Terrain Defense Pods were engaged in the battle, and Imperial Troop Transports carried by Low Altitude Assault Transport carriers were being deployed as TIE fighters swarmed above the city. Vader, the Inquisitors, and their elite troopers secured their landing platform, and moved to the palace to locate King Lee-Char in order to find the whereabouts of the King's Jedi advisor.[2]
            During the battle, Lee-Char contacted Tarkin in orbit in an effort to withdraw Imperial forces from Mon Cala and that the attack by Imperial forces was unwarranted. Tarkin countered by stating that an Imperial envoy was assassinated, and that either he was killed by orders from Lee-Char or that the population was not in control, which would merit a military response. Lee-Char rebutted, exclaiming that Mon Cala was not involved with the death of Telvar and that his death would not serve a purpose. The conversation continued with Tarkin stating that if Lee-Char were correct, then he should order his forces to stand down and allow an Imperial investigation to look into the matter. Lee-Char reiterated, stating that they were not investigating, rather invading, and that continued attacks would be met with an aggressive response. When Tarkin asked if it was a threat, Lee-Char stated that it was rather a warning.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Telvar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTelvar</string></dict>

        <key>Gadon Thek</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.247.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gadon Thek was leader of the Hidden Beks, a swoop gang operating in the Lower City of Taris. He had run-ins with Marn Hierogryph, whom he referred to as a "rodent".
            Despite his ties to the criminal underworld of Taris, Gadon was generally considered a good man amongst lower city citizens who protected those who were loyal to him, and was known to assist the poor. Still, he resented the Sith presence and was labeled a menace.
            During the Mandalorian occupation of Taris, Gadon led the Hidden Beks in resistance to the invaders. He recognized that he led a gang, though, not an army and had hopes to ally with the Taris Resistance. The Resistance was reluctant to work with a group they considered to be inferior to them, however, a feeling that solidified when Taris' constable Sowrs joined them. Believing that the Beks were to blame for her children's kidnapping, she refused to negotiate with Gadon.
            With the arrival of Zayne Carrick, however, Gadon saw a chance to meet with the constable, using the wanted "Jedi killer" as leverage. This proved to be unneeded, however, when Zayne, Gryph, and Mission Vao discovered that the constable's children had been captured by gang member Brejik and were being cared for by Griff Vao. Though angry with the two, they had an even better way to get into the Resistance's good graces, Gadon led the Beks to the Resistance headquarters to negotiate a temporary alliance.
            Claiming that it was Zayne who found the constable's children, Gadon succeeded in convincing the Resistance's leader, Taris Senator Haydel Goravvus to work with them. Also, he further protected the fugitive from Raana Tey, as Carrick was one of the Beks.
            Later, Gadon helped plan the bombing of the Jedi Tower in hopes of taking out Mandalorian leader Cassus Fett. Gadon led the group to the foundation of the Tower, using the tunnels below to reach it, and helped rig the area with explosives. The mission soon went south, however, as Fett had already vacated the building and the Mandalorians had discovered and attacked the Resistance headquarters. While the rest of the Beks fell back to the Pit, Gadon and Gryph stayed behind in hopes of rescuing Zayne and Shel Jelavan, who were both still inside the Tower. Dropping a line to Zayne and Shel, Gadon managed to narrowly escape the pursuing Mandalorians.
            Thek would later lose his sight in a swoop bike accident. However, this was partially restored through ocular implants.[1]
            After the crash it was assumed that Gadon's most apt follower and adopted son Brejik would assume leadership of the gang due to Gadon's accident. However, Gadon believed that Brejik wasn't ready to take over and that he was still well enough to lead the gang. This act of public humiliation angered Brejik and in a rage he along with younger members of the Hidden Bek gang broke off and joined their arch rivals the Black Vulkars. It wasn't long until Brejik and his followers took over the Black Vulkar gang and started a gang war to wipe out the Beks and take over the Lower City, unlike the Beks, the Vulkars dealt more openly and unashamedly in illicit drugs and slavery. The resulting gang war created problems for the citizens of the Lower City since the Vulkars were not only killing Hidden Beks, but also anyone else they came across.[1]
            When Revan crashed on Taris, he sought Gadon's aid and retrieved a prototype accelerator that had been stolen by the Vulkars. Gadon mentioned that the accelerator would be in their base. Traveling through the Undercity Revan made his way to the base and retrieved the accelerator. Using the accelerator, Revan won the freedom of Bastila Shan, who had been captured and held prisoner by the Vulkars.
            Taris was later destroyed by Darth Malak via orbital bombardment.[1]
            Gadon Thek was voiced by Phil LaMarr.
            When retrieving the accelerator, a member of the Vulkars, Kandon Ark, makes Revan an offer. If Revan assassinates Gadon, he/she can race for the Vulkars plus 500 credits. This causes the player to gain a dark side point, and there are no changes in the following events.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gadon_Thek</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGadonThek</string></dict>
        <key>Thexan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.248.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Thexan was a Force-sensitive male Human who served the Eternal Empire. He was the son of Emperor Valkorion and Senya Tirall, and fought many battles on the Eternal Empire's behalf. He died in a brief lightsaber duel with his twin brother, Arcann.
            Thexan was the son of Emperor Valkorion of the Eternal Empire and Senya Tirall, one of the Knights of Zakuul. He and his twin brother Arcann were trained from childhood to be warriors, with Thexan always being there in harsh times. The twins and their younger sister, Vaylin, ignored their mother, but their father ignored them as well when they were children. Arcann grew more resentful towards their father, despite Thexan's attempts to placate him.
            When Vaylin's growing power and mental instability forced Valkorion to send her to Nathema to control her power, Thexan would make regular visits to her; he resented the planet being a void in the Force as much as his sister did.[3]
            Eventually, when the children reached adulthood, Arcann retrieved Vaylin from Nathema. Valkorion then presented Vaylin with her first lightsaber. The twins move to defend when their sister ignited her blade, only to stay their hand at their father's command. Vaylin soon deactivated the blade and pledged her allegiance to Valkorion.[4]
            In 3637 BBY,[1] during the invasion of the galaxy, Arcann lost his arm and received heavy scarring to his face during an attack on the Sith world of Korriban, with Thexan being by his side after the injury. Soon after the attack on Korriban, Thexan was to report to his father on the status of the invasion.
            At some point during the conquest, Arcann and Thexan led an assault on Balmorra.
            Arcann and Thexan later presented the lightsabers of fallen Jedi and Sith as trophies from the battle to their father, with Valkorion turning away in silence, infuriating Arcann, and overcome by the dark side of the Force he attempted to attack the Emperor. Thexan pulled his brother back. Arcann turned his attention to his brother and struck out at him, but their brief duel ended when Thexan was struck down by his brother with a cut across the stomach, killing him. Coming to his senses, Arcann cradled his twin's body in his arms before looking up to see Valkorion looming over him, asking his remaining son to come with him.
            A funeral was later held saying that he was killed in the Core Worlds. The truth of his death remained unknown to everyone, including Senya, for five years, until Vaylin told her the truth during the Battle of Asylum.[5]
            Thexan first appeared in Sacrifice, a cinematic trailer produced by Blur Studio for Star Wars: The Old Republic's fifth digital expansion, Knights of the Fallen Empire. The trailer was released at the Electronic Eterntainment Expo on June 15, in 2015. While not named in dialogue, Thexan's name can be seen in Aurebesh on his crib at the beginning of the trailer. He is voiced by Erik Todd Dellums who also voiced his twin brother Arcann.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thexan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascThexan</string></dict>

Tassu was selected to be a Padawan by a Jedi Master. After years of study and having constructed a green-bladed lightsaber for himself, Tassu went on to pass his Trials of Knighthood and was given the rank of Jedi Knight.[2]
            In 22 BBY,[3] Tassu was stationed at the Temple when Master of the Order Mace Windu rallied all available Jedi to join an assault team in order to rescue the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, as well as the Naboo senator Padmé Amidala from the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Arriving on the desert plains of the planet Geonosis, Tassu stormed the Petranaki arena with his comrades in order to free the prisoners. Tassu was assigned to arm the two captured Jedi with the help of fellow Jedi Sephjet Josall. Rushing the arena floor, Josall and Tassu were able to pass on their spare weapons.[1]

            He was then present again the next day and was amongst a group whom the First Order deserter Finn approached in search of water. Another of the group shooed Finn away, forcing him to drink from a happabore trough. Both Juhden and Finn were later amongst a group who gathered to watch Rey fight off two thugs working for the junk dealer Unkar Plutt, who ran Niima. Rey's attackers attempted to steal the astromech droid BB-8 from the scavenger, but she managed to successfully fight them both off with her quarterstaff.

        <key>Tarro Blood</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.251.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tarro Blood was a Human male Mandalorian-turned bounty hunter who operated during the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He was a competitor in the Great Hunt, going to great lengths in order to sabotage his fellow competitors.
            The son of Alderaanian nobility, Tarro Blood renounced his privileged existence as the heir to a minor lordship in favor of pursuing greater glory and fame as a galaxy-renowned Mandalorian mercenary.
            Leaving his past behind and taking on a new dramatic moniker, Blood was able to prove that he was no pretender after years of training under the famed Mandalorian champion, Hedarr Soongh. Under the guidance of this exceptional tutor, Blood became a feared warrior and the favorite to claim victory in the next Great Hunt.
            Unfortunately for him, Tarro Blood’s characteristic arrogance and sudden rise to prominence rubbed his competition the wrong way. The other Mandalorians in the competition made it their mission to ensure that he never came close to claiming victory. The resulting defeat nearly cost Blood his life, in addition to his pride, and he remained out of the public eye for nearly a decade, choosing not to participate in the next Great Hunt.
            After ten years, Blood entered another Hunt, and had no desire to maintain honor during the competition, sabotaging his competitors at every chance. One of the rival hunters he targeted was Braden, who had found a talented protege to be a Great Hunt competitor. While the Hunter was out collecting a bounty on the Corellian fugitive Vexx, Blood had his accomplice, Sedyn Kyne, murder Braden and his friend Jory, unaware that his actions were on holocam, in order to strand the Hunter on Nal Hutta. He later dispatched a Rodian bounty hunter named Nails to take down the Hunter but his lackey greatly underestimated her opponent and was killed.
            The Hunter managed to win sponsorship into the Great Hunt from Suudaa Nem'ro and arrived on Dromund Kaas to win a spot in the final melee. Blood continued to interfere by hiring freelance Imperial soldiers to interrupt the Hunter's first bounty and later tried claiming that the Hunter died within the Dark Temple, all unsuccessful. When the Hunter won the final melee and became a Great Hunt competitor, Blood directly interfered and tried to denounce the Hunter's credentials, saying they were falsified, but the Huntmaster and his assistant had already made their decision. Frustrated that his adversary would not die, Blood promised that he would have the Hunter's skull in his hand by the time the competition was finished. He then alerted the Imperial authorities that the Hunter intended to steal a D5-Mantis Patrol Craft from the local spaceport; he was unjustly considered an honest Mandalorian. Despite this, the Hunter succeeded and stole the ship.
            Throughout the Great Hunt, Blood made constant interference in the Hunter's hunts. On Balmorra, he tricked Vexx's siblings into thinking that the Hunter shot Vexx in the back and killed Braden when he discovered the "crime." He then alerted Hunt target Tyresius Lokai that the Hunter was after him and on Alderaan, paid off House Rist to assassinate the hunter. Blood also leaked the list of Great Hunt targets to sell on an auction on Hutta, forcing Assistant Huntsmaster Lek to call on the Hunter for assistance.
            Hedarr Soongh became aware of Blood's crimes and assisted the Hunter in taking out Blood's allies on Nar Shaddaa. Kyne was challenged to a death match and lost, but his compatriots fatally wounded Soongh when they refused his demand to stop persecuting the Hunter, but were subsequently killed by the Hunter, thus depriving Blood of any support in the Hunt.
            The final target of the Great Hunt was Jedi Master Kellian Jarro, credited for the highest number of Mandalorian deaths. Blood was the first hunter to reach Jarro but was quickly subdued by a mind trick. Held under questioning, Blood claimed that the Hunter was his accomplice, hoping that the Republic would detain or at least kill his rival once and for all. He was wrong on both counted. Face-to-face for the last time, separated by a forcefield, Blood attempted to goad the Hunter into releasing him and facing him for a final confrontation, claiming that both Soongh and Braden would've wanted it. Mako, the Hunter's partner, stated that Braden would've wanted to see Blood as he was, undeserving of a warrior's death.
            Blood's fate can be decided three ways: leaving him in his cell to die when the ship is vaporized, freeing him from his cell to fight him in a stand up duel, or freeing him from his cell and shooting him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tarro_Blood</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTarroBlood</string></dict>
        <key>Rhad Tarn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.252.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rhad Tarn was a male Human Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the final decades of the Republic Classic era. When the galaxy erupted in war during the last years of the Republic, Tarn believed the Confederacy of Independent Systems was right to wish the Republic's demise and left the Order.[2]
            After being discovered to be Force-sensitive, Rhad Tarn was taken to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training in the ways of the Force. Passing through the Temple's academy, Tarn was taken as a Padawan by a Jedi Master. Traveling on journey missions along the Outer Rim Territories, Tarn came face-to-face with the harsh realities of slave labor and illegal prisons. Crafting for himself a blue-bladed lightsaber, Tarn went on to pass his Trials of Knighthood and ascend to the rank of Jedi Knight.[1]
            Not long after becoming a Knight, the Separatist Crisis which had plagued the Republic for years exploded into all out war, pitting the Jedi and the Republic against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. When the Jedi High Council recalled all Jedi to Coruscant to take up arms against the Confederacy by joining the Grand Army of the Republic, Tarn invoked the Right of Denial. Avoiding Coruscant, Tarn headed for the Outer Rim, citing his belief that the Republic was too corrupt to save and that the Jedi owed their loyalty to The Force, not any government or military. Gathering a following of other dissident Jedi, Tarn became a known face of dissension in the ranks of the Order, causing members of the High Council to fear a schism to be on the horizon. In order to prevent the fracturing of the Order, Master of the Order Mace Windu called for a meeting with Tarn and fellow leaders to have an open discussion about their different stances.[2][1]
            Contacted three months after the start of the war by fellow dissident Master Sora Bulq, Tarn agreed to meet with Windu and others on the Weequay's family's old estate on a moon circling Bulq's homeworld of Sriluur, known as Ruul. Along with Jedi K'Kruhk, Sian Jeisel, and Mira, Tarn arrived on Ruul and prepared for the forum that Windu had called for. When Windu arrived, Tarn was the most outspoken amongst the group, making no hesitation to share his feelings that the Jedi should join the Confederacy.[2] Advocating rebellion against the Republic for turning a blind eye to the suffering on the Outer Rim, Tarn worried his compatriots with his radical thinking. The other dissidents attempted to calm Tarn during the informal discussion, stating that they agreed that the Republic was corrupt, but none of them were willing to side with the Confederacy.[1]
            As the stay on Ruul progressed, Tarn became more and more distrustful of Master Windu's intentions, feeling that Windu was prepared to betray them at a moments notice in order to keep the Order together. In fact, Tarn was correct in his suspicion that the meeting was not all it appeared to be, but failed to recognize the source of the discordance. In reality, the quiet and contemplative Sora Bulq had fallen to the dark side and sided with Count Dooku, becoming one of his minions. The meeting was essentially a trap to lure Mace Windu within the reach of Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress' blades. Ventress, arriving on Ruul with only Bulq knowing, attacked the Jedi, killing Mira and appearing as if she was in league with Master Windu. While K'Kruhk attempted to avoid jumping to conclusions about the events and Ventress' relationship to Master Windu, Tarn's distrust boiled over and he became filled with rage.[2][1]
            Racing off to find the assassin, Tarn was treading dangerously close to the dark side. During the ensuing lightsaber battle with Ventress, the Dark Jedi taunted and toyed with the young Jedi, only making him angrier. Ventress took advantage of this and encouraged Tarn to call on his rage, managing to turn the Jedi to the Dark Side of the Force. When asked to join Ventress, Tarn extinguished his lightsaber and accepted. By the time K'Kruhk and Jeisel showed up to take on Ventress, the two Jedi found themselves facing a Dark Jedi as well as an enraged Tarn. Disarmed and pinned to a rock, Jeisel pleaded with Tarn not to give in to the dark side. But Tarn was already too consumed with rage to hear her. As he made his killing swipe, Jeisel acquired her lightsaber and quickly cut Tarn across the torso, killing him.[2][1]
            Rhad Tarn represented the Jedi's worst fears about what the war had the potential to do to the Jedi Order. Because he had fallen so easily, they wondered how many more would. Word quickly reached the Temple of Tarn's death, while the other dissident Jedi reached out to his followers and attempted to bring them back into the Order.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rhad_Tarn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRhadTarn</string></dict>

            Tarre Vizsla was a Force-sensitive human male who, as a child, was eventually inducted into the Jedi Order, becoming the first Mandalorian to do so.[3] According to legend, Vizsla created the darksaber, a unique black-colored lightsaber, during his time as a Jedi. The darksaber became the symbol of leadership for House Vizsla,[1] and eventually, Tarre Vizsla became Mand'alor of his planet.[4]
            After Vizsla's passing, the saber was kept in the Jedi Temple until it was taken by members of House Vizsla[1] during the fall of the Old Republic[5] and was used to unite Mandalore.[1] Sometime after his death, a large statue was erected on Mandalore to remember his legacy. When the Mandalorian Sabine Wren was young, her father, Alrich Wren, brought her to the statue to appreciate its history and legacy. During the Mandalorian civil war during the Imperial Era, the Galactic Empire constructed an outpost on the statue, disrespecting it. Not willing to allow the Empire to disrespect what it stood for, Sabine and her younger brother, Tristan Wren destroyed the outpost, bringing the statue back to its former appearance.[4]

        <key>Wilhuff Tarkin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.254.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wilhuff Tarkin was a human male who served the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire. During the Clone Wars, Tarkin served as a Republic captain under Jedi Master Even Piell and was taken prisoner by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, before escaping with the help of a Jedi and clone trooper strike team. During the incident Piell was killed and Tarkin was later promoted to Admiral and served as prosecutor in the trial of Ahsoka Tano, who was framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar.
            After Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire and proclaimed the Jedi as fugitives, Tarkin became the Empire's first Grand Moff, and regional Governor of the Outer Rim. With this responsibility, he was also given oversight of the Death Star which he took command over after removing Orson Krennic from the position once it was operational. He believed that fear of the battle station would keep the local systems loyal to the Empire, and used it to destroy Alderaan to showcase the station's power. The Rebel Alliance squad Rogue One, however, stole the plans to the Death Star from Scarif, and Luke Skywalker was able to destroy it during the Battle of Yavin, killing all those on board, including Tarkin.
            Wilhuff Tarkin was born on the planet Eriadu into the wealthy Tarkin family. He lived with his family in the family compound, where the Tarkins had lived for over a millennium. Wilhuff's father and mother taught him that Eriadu hadn't always been the safe environment that it seemed—the entire planet had once been an untamed wilderness. The jungle and predators had been more of a threat than pirates and marauders. The early Tarkins had helped settle Eriadu; they had been their own police force. Later a militia had been formed—under Tarkin leadership. Wilhuff took these history lessons to heart. Wilhuff's parents made sure that he knew that respect, discipline and obedience were of the utmost importance. Because of this Wilhuff thought of himself as a product of a military upbringing. One night while at supper Tarkin's father ordered a servant to take Wilhuff's plate before he could eat—teaching him how easy it is to lose something.[1]
            Following family tradition, Wilhuff's grand-uncle Jova Tarkin, along with two other relatives and two Rodian guides, took him on trips to the Carrion Plateau, on which he taught the young survival skills and lessons on the savage wilderness that his ancestors had tamed. After passing a test in which he outwitted a pack of predators at the Carrion Spike, sixteen year-old Tarkin was deemed to have completed his testing on the plateau. Six months after passing this test, Wilhuff's training shifted to space combat. More family members and hired trainers taught him tactics and piloting skills, while admonishing him to apply the lessons he learned as a hunter to control the pirates and lawbreakers of the Outer Rim.[1]
            Tarkin joined the Outland Regions Security Force, a force dedicated to protecting Eriadu and the Greater Seswenna sector in the absence of a Republic military. As part of this organization's anti-pirate taskforce, he made a name for himself by outwitting and brutally suppressing a group of pirates known as Q'anah's Marauders during the Greater Seswenna raids. After decoding the pattern in the pirate leader Q'anah's attacks, Tarkin captured her ship, launching her and her crew on a slow course into a sun. The Outland ships broadcast the suffering of Q'anah's crew on her group's comm network, and destroyed any ships that came to her rescue. At the age of nineteen, Tarkin was even designing new ships for the Outland Security Force.[1]
            After working with the Outland Regions Security Force, Tarkin attended the Sullust Sector Spacefarers Academy to join the Judicial Department's forces. While training there, he met Sheev Palpatine, then a Senator from Naboo. Palpatine offered to help him secure a place in the Republic's Judicial Academy, but asked him to consider a career in politics. Tarkin did not follow the Senator's advice at the time, but did take his help in admission to the Academy. Following an overly dramatic entrance at the head of an Outland delegation, Tarkin had a hard time fitting in, often brawling with other students.[1]
            A mission to the world Halcyon alongside a group of Jedi gave him a chance to prove his worth, when the officer leading his team disobeyed Jedi orders and set off on a march to attack their target from another angle. The other Judicials quickly proved to be out of their depth in the wilderness, and came to rely on Tarkin's skills and leadership as he brought them safely to the objective, where the Jedi had just completed the mission. Tarkin was credited with saving their lives. Stories began to circulate within the Judicial Department of his exploits. As he continued to build a name for himself, Tarkin saw that conflicts throughout the galaxy were increasing, and turned his mind to Palpatine's advice to enter politics.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wilhuff_Tarkin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWilhuffTarkin</string></dict>

        <key>Brenn Tantor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.256.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brenn Tantor was a young Human male from Garos IV who dreamed of becoming one of the Imperial stormtroopers who kept the peace on his homeworld. After his graduation from the Academy of Carida, however, he became much more when he was recruited out of the Stormtrooper Corps and made an officer in the Imperial Army as part of an elite project. Supervised by Grand General Malcor Brashin, he rose rapidly through the ranks, becoming a prominent general. Tantor reached his height as an Imperial general in 3 ABY when he directed the Battle of Hoth and shortly after that captured Rebel Alliance Commander Luke Skywalker on Abridon.
            When Tantor's brother Dellis, an Imperial Intelligence officer, revealed that the Empire had killed their father, Brenn had a crisis of conscience. After refusing an order to massacre civilians and being told that Dellis had been killed, Tantor defected to the Rebel Alliance. After gaining the trust of General Tyr Taskeen, Tantor took a pivotal role in the Rebellion and later the New Republic, commanding such engagements as the Battle of Endor and the Liberation of Coruscant. In the latter, Tantor discovered that Dellis was being kept in Imperial custody—custody from which he was freed, finally reuniting him with his brother.
            The Human male Brenn Tantor was born to a middle-class family on Garos IV during a time of civil war. The Galactic Empire intervened to end the conflict, and this imposition of peace impressed Tantor's father so much that he enlisted as a military transport pilot and raised his sons to respect the stormtroopers who kept order. However, a resistance movement grew against the Empire, and the Tantor family's house was destroyed during an episode of fighting. Stormtroopers rescued Brenn and his younger brother Dellis from the rubble, leading the pair to vow that they would become stormtroopers themselves.[1]
            Brenn Tantor immediately gained admission to the Imperial Academy of Carida and underwent stormtrooper training, where he excelled in his studies of tactics. Dellis followed him one year later. During their training they were told the tragic news that their father had been killed by the Rebel Alliance in the course of a mission to deliver medical supplies to Graal'diin. This only increased their resolve to become stormtroopers and fight the Rebellion.[1]
            The two were excellent cadets, but were mysteriously prevented from joining a stormtrooper squad; unknown to them, it was because they were not clones.[1][2] The two began to shadow Cattena Squadron, stationed at the Academy, until the squad captain, impressed by their dedication, allowed them to join as "honorary stormtroopers." However, they were never able to gain real acceptance from the rest of the unit, whom they never encountered socially.[1]
            In 0 BBY, Cattena Squadron was sent to Kalaan. In the course of a battle, the squad's sergeant was killed and Tantor, a corporal, took command. His excellent performance caught the attention of Captain Beri Tulon, a training officer who was scouting for prospects for a special project. Tulon gave Tantor a battlefield promotion to lieutenant and ordered him to report to the Star Destroyer Inquisitor. Dellis, who had been wounded shortly before Tulon arrived, was transferred to Inquisitor as well and placed in a bacta tank.[1]
            Tantor was to become one of the first officers to learn how to command troops using the Battlefield Holographic Control Interface, or BHCI. The pet project of Grand General Malcor Brashin, the BHCI could allow a commander to view the full picture of a battle in holographic simulation and gave him the power to relay orders to the battlefield from the impunity of an orbiting Star Destroyer.[1]
            From Inquisitor, then in orbit over Tatooine, Tantor walked Zeta Squadron, with the addition of the freshly-healed Dellis, through a simple set of orders to familiarize himself with the system. However, the exercise was cut short when Brashin broke in to issue Tantor new orders. An escape pod launched from the Rebel CR90 corvette Tantive IV had been tracked to his vicinity. Lieutenant Tantor was able to quickly find the pod, despite attacks from indigenous Tusken Raider. In spite of the natives' hostility, Tulon admonished him to never engage the locals unless provoked and behave as "a soldier, not a murderer."[1]
            Tantor led further missions to recover the Rebel droids that had been in the escape pod, including tracking and capturing the Jawa Sandcrawler that had carried the droids, and searching the home of local hermit Ben Kenobi.[1]
            However, the Imperials were too far behind, and the droids escaped the planet with the plans to the Death Star, a recently-constructed Imperial battlestation. The droids had apparently fled to Alderaan aboard the YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon, but some in the Empire believed that the ship's canny captain Han Solo had jumped to Ruul, along the same vector. Tantor, now a captain, was sent to Ruul with Tulon and Brashin. Although Solo had not jumped there, the Imperials did find that Rebels had captured an important computer facility on Ruul. Tantor, with help from his technically-minded brother on the ground, was able to recapture the facility and string a line of remote relay beacons from the station to an undamaged antenna from which he could broadcast important Rebel data found in the computer complex. For his excellent performance, Tantor was promoted to the rank of commander and placed under Grand General Brashin's personal supervision. Nevertheless, he continued to hold the greatest respect for Captain Tulon, who had been reassigned after Brashin found his more traditional values incompatible with the New Order.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brenn_Tantor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBrennTantor</string></dict>
        <key>Thanisson</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.257.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Thanisson was a human male who served the First Order as a petty officer on board the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer, the flagship of General Armitage Hux. While on the bridge he wore a black uniform marked with the First Order insignia, along with black boots an intercomm headset. Thanisson had fair skin and blond hair.[2]
            He was present aboard the Finalizer during the raid on Jakku, and reported the theft of a TIE/sf space superiority fighter by the rogue stormtrooper FN-2187 and the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron.[1] Dameron and Finn then fired upon the hangar command center where Thanisson was seated, flinging the petty officer from his chair amongst the shattered remnants of the window in front of him.[3]
            Thanisson was a human male who served in the military branch of the First Order during their conflict with the Resistance, an offshoot of the New Republic.[3] In the year 34 ABY,[4] Thanisson held the rank of petty officer and was stationed onboard[3] the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer known as the Finalizer,[2] where he was posted[3] in the main control room for Hangar Six under Colonel Kaplan and Chief Petty Officer Unamo.[5]
            Thanisson was onboard the Finalizer when it traveled to the planet Jakku in search of the[3] retired explorer[2] Lor San Tekka, who held a piece of a map to the location of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. After the First Order deployed forces to San Tekka's home village of Tuanul, the explorer was killed and the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron was captured; however, the map was spirited away by Dameron's astromech droid BB-8, whom the First Order failed to capture.[3]
            Dameron was brought on board the Finalizer for interrogation, but as the hunt for BB-8 began, the pilot was freed by FN-2187, a stormtrooper hoping to defect from the First Order. The trooper brought Dameron into Hangar Six under the pretense of escorting the prisoner and then hurriedly boarded one[3] of the TIE/sf space superiority fighters[2] in Bay Two of the hangar. When the pair attempted to take off, they discovered the starfighter's support cabling was still attached, preventing their escape and drawing the attention of Thanisson in the control room.[3]
            Thanisson immediately reported the unsanctioned departure to Colonel Kaplan, who ordered that the TIE be stopped from escaping while General[3] Armitage Hux,[6] head of the First Order's military, be alerted. Squads of stormtroopers[3] carrying F-11D blaster rifles and FWMB-10 repeating blasters[2] then attempted to shoot down the starfighter, but were unsuccessful as FN-2187 used the vehicle's[3] Lb-14 dual heavy laser turret[2] to blast many of them. The trooper then turned the turret on the control room, shattering the windows in an explosion and throwing Thanisson from his seat while Kaplan and the other officers present tried to cower away from the blast. Once Dameron managed to disconnect the support cabling, the fighter escaped from the Finalizer and headed for Jakku, but was shot down by the battlecruiser en route and crashed on the planet's surface.[3]
            Thanisson first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015. He was not identified in the film, but received a name in the reference book Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film.
            He was played by British actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster, best known for his roles as the son of Liam Neeson's character in the 2003 film Love Actually, Jojen Reed on HBO's Game of Thrones, Newt in The Maze Runner films, and as the voice of Ferb Fletcher on Disney's Phineas and Ferb.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thanisson</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascThanisson</string></dict>
        <key>Thanoth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.258.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Thanoth was a male human who served the Galactic Empire as an extremely skilled inspector. He was assigned to the Sith Lord Darth Vader as an adjutant in order to help investigate a large sum of credits confiscated from the Son-tuul Pride being stolen from the Arquitens-class light cruiser.
            The male human Thanoth held the rank of inspector and worked for the Galactic Empire's Inspectorate during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, he was assigned by Grand General Cassio Tagge to replace Oon-ai as an adjutant for the Sith Lord Darth Vader while Vader investigated the theft of a large sum of credits from an Imperial Arquitens-class light cruiser. When first introduced to Vader on Tagge's Super Star Destroyer Annihilator, the Inspector noted dust on Vader's armor which placed him on the moon Anthan 13 within the last 24 hours, an orbital body located in the same star system that the theft had taken place, leading the inspector to correctly assume that Vader had been behind the incident.[2]
            Eventually, Thanoth, a dedicated patriot of the Empire, uncovered Vader's true identity as Anakin Skywalker, and figured out Vader's plan to replace Emperor Palpatine. The inspector met and told Vader where he could find the wayward Doctor Aphra on Cosmatanic Steppes. Thanoth was subsequently killed instantly by the Sith Lord's lightsaber to keep his secret, although Thanoth believed it was for the best of the Empire that Vader succeeded.[1] Thanoth considered the destruction of the Death Star to be a sign of the Emperor's growing weakness, and believed the Empire would be better off if Vader overthrew Palpatine with the aid of his son, Luke Skywalker.[source?]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thanoth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascThanoth</string></dict>
        <key>Pter Thanas</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.259.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Pter Thanas was a male Coruscanti Human Imperial Navy commander who defected to the Rebel Alliance after the Bakura Incident during the Galactic Civil War. Thanas was noted as a diplomatic officer of the Imperial Starfleet, known for his ability to rule successfully without using fear as a motivator. Early in his career, he led an Imperial task force against the Crimson Nova pirates on F'Dann IX.
            During a tour of duty on icy Alzoc III, he became popular among the native Talz laborers for his progressive policies. By increasing their food budgets, he was able to increase the mine's work output and also win the hearts and minds of the Talz. When a less sympathetic Imperial colonel arrived and reduced their rations to previous levels, this provoked an uprising among the laborers. For refusing to crush the uprising, Thanas was reassigned to the newly occupied planet of Bakura in 1 BBY.
            There, he became the commander of the local Imperial naval defense and answered only to the Governor Nereus. In 4 ABY, Bakura was invaded by the saurian Ssi-ruuvi Imperium which quickly wiped out half the garrison and blockaded Bakura. Shortly after the Battle of Endor, a Rebel Alliance fleet arrived to relieve the Imperials after receiving a request for help.
            Following the Bakura Truce between the Alliance and the Empire, Thanas cooperated with the Alliance and developed an intimate relationship with Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. However, with the defeat of the Ssi-ruuk, Nereus ordered Thanas to turn on the Alliance fleet. In the ensuing chaos, Thanas' flagship the Dominant destroyed several Rebel ships. In response, Han Solo nearly attempted to dislodge the Dominant from the Imperial formation by ramming the cruiser with his starship the Millennium Falcon.
            However, Skywalker's communications with Thanas via the Force helped convince him to change sides. As a gesture, Thanas opened fire on the Ssi-ruuvi cruiser Shriwirr and sent a medical team to treat the mortally wounded Dev Sibwarra. With the death of Nereus and the surrender of the Imperial garrison under favorable terms, an awed Thanas defected to his former enemies.
            In 12 ABY, he married the Bakuran Prime Minister Gaeriel Captison. Shortly thereafter Captison gave birth to a daughter, Malinza. Three years later, Thanas was diagnosed with the debilitating Knowt's Disease. Thanas suffered through the slow killing illness, and finally passed away in 16 ABY at the age of 64 after Captison's unsuccessful reelection campaign.
            The Human male Pter Thanas was born and raised on the galactic capital of Coruscant prior to joining the Imperial Navy. His military career was attached to the Carrack-class cruiser Dominant. Early in his career, Thanas led an Imperial task force formed around the Dominant against the Crimson Nova pirates. While the pirates put up heavy resistance against the Imperial forces, Thanas was able to defeat their fleet and destroy their base on F’Dann IX.[1]
            Thanas was the commanding officer of a mining operation on Alzoc III when he determined that the enslaved indigenous Talz workers performed at high rates of output when provided greater food rations. By rearranging his budget, Thanas was able to provide more food to the Talz and triple the mining outputs. The Talz repaid his kindness when they saved Thanas from falling down a mineshaft.[6]
            When an Imperial colonel arrived six months later to replace Thanas, he immediately returned the Talz’s food rations to their previous levels. A Talz leader protested the change, and the colonel ordered Thanas to destroy the Talz village as a demonstration of Imperial will. Thanas refused the order and was summarily reassigned to the newly Imperial-controlled Outer Rim world of Bakura in 1 ABY.[6]
            At Bakura, Thanas served as the commanding military officer of the Bakuran garrison and the Dominant became the flagship of the defense force. As a relatively strategically unimportant planet, the military garrison at Bakura was equipped with downscaled warships. He oversaw the operations of the minor planetary defenses and was second only to Wilek Nereus, Bakura’s Imperial Governor. While Thanas chaffed under the thumb of the Empire, his diligence as an officer may have saved Bakura.[6]
            While the Battle of Endor was taking place in 4 ABY, the saurian Ssi-Ruuvi Imperium invaded the Bakura system, annihilating half of the tiny Imperial-Bakuran defense force and seizing most of the outer system outposts. These saurians hailed from the distant reaches of Unknown Regions and were scouting Imperial space.[6] They brought a sizable fleet with them, including at least one Ssi-ruuvi assault carrier, as well as large numbers of battle droids.[7] An outpost in the sixth planet of the Bakuran system was utterly destroyed and a command signal for Ssi-ruuk droids established in its vicinity. The Ssi-ruuvi fleet then blockaded the space around Bakura.[1][6]
            With half of the Imperial fleet destroyed, Thanas quickly ordered a withdrawal of the remaining vessels to Bakura. This decision saved many lives as it allowed the meager Imperial forces to recuperate and hold off against the advancing Ssi-ruuvi fleet. Recovery crew had reported that the Ssi-ruuk had left no survivors or bodies for inexplicable reasons. Later, it was learned that these unfortunate prisoners had been captured by the reptilian Ssi-ruuk and subjected to entechment. The Bakurans also received a transmission from Sibwarra that told them of the fate they soon experience—that of entechment—and although Sibwarra described it as an eternal release, the Bakurans knew that was a lie.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pter_Thanas</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPterThanas</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Thanaton</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.260.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Thanaton was a Human male Inquisitor and Dark Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War. Thanaton was born in 3696 BBY as Teneb Kel, a slave of the Empire who was discovered by the Sith Lord Calypho and taken as his apprentice on the Sith holy world of Korriban. There, Kel trained in the art of assassination and the secrets of the dark side of the Force until his Master's heresy and ambition resulted in Calypho's arrest and internment by the Empire's Dark Council. Now forced to carry the burden of his Master's disloyalty, Kel was sent by the Council to serve with the Imperial Military on the front lines of the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic and its Jedi Order. There he was joined by his Abyssin slave called Maggot and achieved many successes on the battlefield—including a vital victory in the battle for Begeren, wherein Kel's efforts ensured that the ancient Sith world would be reclaimed by the Empire.
            However, even after numerous military triumphs, Kel still carried with him the taint of his Master's failures in the eyes of the Dark Council. To ensure his obedience and put the young Sith to proper use, the Council recalled Kel to the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas in 3678 BBY. There, they forced him to combat and nearly kill the imprisoned Calypho before giving Kel a mission of the utmost importance: to locate and execute Exal Kressh, former apprentice to the Sith Emperor and traitor to the Empire. After receiving direction from the Emperor himself, Kel took Maggot to the Lenico system where he unsuccessfully attempted to kill the rogue Sith; he was beaten by Kressh and left stranded on the dead world of Lenico IV, where he experienced a Force-induced vision that revealed to him Kressh's history. He learned that the Emperor was planning on turning her and countless others into his "Children"—puppets of his will and extensions of his presence—thereby ensuring his immortality and omnipotence. Kel escaped Lenico IV with Maggot's help and tracked Kressh to Korriban, where she had sparked a massive battle to distract from her plans to destroy the Emperor's Children. In the tombs beneath the Valley of the Dark Lords, Kel caught and killed his quarry, but was also forced to murder Maggot to ensure the Emperor's secret plans would not be revealed.
            His victory over Kressh and knowledge of the Emperor's Children allowed for Kel to return to the Dark Council and demand that they promote him from an apprentice to a Sith Lord. He seized the mantle of Darth Thanaton for himself and went about building a formidable power base within the Empire's Sphere of Ancient Knowledge. Throughout the remainder of the Great Galactic War, Thanaton gathered to himself a considerable amount of influence within the Imperial hierarchy and garnered a reputation as a strict Sith traditionalist—one who sought to uphold the historical precedents of Imperial politics and dark side philosophy. This disposition repeatedly brought him into conflict with Lord Zash, a young Sith witch who bucked tradition in favor of pursuing her own paths to power. Thanaton and his ally, Darth Skotia, believed Zash to be a corrupting influence, particularly given her supervisory position at the Korriban academy. Together, they worked to block her ascension until 3643 BBY, when Zash manipulated her apprentice into murdering Skotia so that she could access the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas.
            Thanaton's attempts to punish Zash for the murder backfired and the Dark Council instead promoted her to Darth Zash, replacing Skotia as Thanaton's immediate subordinate. To Darth Thanaton's chagrin, Zash used her new position to pursue knowledge of immortality and spirit transfer by way of her apprentice, sending the slave-turned-Sith into the Dark Temple and the galaxy beyond to gather ancient artifacts of power. Zash's gambit ended when she was killed by her own apprentice, who then took the title of Lord Kallig. Around this time, Thanaton ascended to the Dark Council and used his place on the Empire's governing body to pursue the death of Kallig, who he believed was equally as corrupt as Zash. Despite his rise to the pinnacle of Sith power, Thanaton failed to kill Kallig on several occasions, motivating him to declare that he and the young Sith would engage in a Kaggath on the contested world of Corellia. The ancient Sith honor battle ended in defeat for Thanaton, who was forced to flee the planet and seek aid from his fellow Councilors on Korriban. Thanaton was followed and again defeated by Kallig in view of the Council; the elder Sith's weakness and violation of Kaggath decorum disappointed the Dark Lords and Darth Mortis snapped Thanaton's neck for his failures. Following his death, his command of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge was passed to Kallig, who took Thanaton's seat on the Council and the name Darth Nox.
            The man who would be known as Darth Thanaton was originally Teneb Kel, a Human male born in 3696 BBY within the territory of the Sith Empire.[1] Early in his life, Kel was an Imperial slave but was eventually discovered to be sensitive to the Force by the Sith Lord Calypho. Calypho pulled the young man out of slavery and took him as an apprentice, instructing him in the methods of the Sith Inquisitors and training him in the discipline of assassination. Kel's Master specialized in the art of divination and foresight and taught his pupil that one's power to gain insight into the future was most potent when the recipient was close to death. In addition to training in assassination and visions, Kel enthusiastically studied Sith history and philosophy in preparation[3] for his future roles within the Empire's Sphere of Ancient Knowledge.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Thanaton</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthThanaton</string></dict>

            A Force-sensitive Human, Tamlen was educated in the dark side of the Force by the Sith Empire, receiving training from the masters of the Sith Academy on Korriban in the year 3956 BBY. While at the academy, Tamlen was assigned to work in the academy's library where he would update the records with new discoveries, such as the lore of Ajunta Pall. While studying Pall, Tamlen came across a legend regarding the Sith Lord's blade. Interested, Tamlen told another student about his discoveries without knowing he was actually speaking with the amnesic Dark Lord of the Sith Revan. Revan had been captured by the Jedi Order and reprogrammed to serve as their weapon against the Empire.[1]
            Following Tamlen's encounter with Revan, the former Dark Lord sought out the legendary blade in the tomb of Lord Pall and recovered it. Shortly thereafter, Revan returned to the academy and assassinated the Academy's Headmaster Uthar Wynn with the assistance of the redeemed Sith Yuthura Ban. Together Revan and Ban purged the academy of all Sith students who would not convert to the Jedi teachings. Tamlen, refusing to abandon the Empire, was slain along with the rest of the academy's occupants.[1]
            Tamlen was voiced by Ethan Phillips in the video game, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tamlen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTamlen</string></dict>
        <key>Raynar Thul</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.262.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Raynar Thul was a Human male who was an antagonist, a friend of the Solo twins, the son of former Alderaan nobles Bornan and Aryn Dro Thul, and the heir of their shipping enterprise, Bornaryn Trading. Following the Mission to Myrkr during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Raynar was taken in by the Killiks. A broken man, he became UnuThul, leader of the Colony. In 35 ABY, the Colony, under the influence of the Dark Nest, attacked the Chiss Ascendancy, starting the Swarm War. A year later, UnuThul was defeated by Luke Skywalker, ending the Swarm War. Thul was taken into Galactic Alliance custody.
            Seven years and numerous surgeries later, he returned to the Jedi Order as an active Jedi Knight and helped in defending the Temple against the Mandalorians mercenaries of Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala. Thul later returned to the Killiks, prepared to become a Joiner if necessary, on a mission to learn extremely valuable secrets about the identity of the dark side entity Abeloth. Having fulfilled his mission, Raynar let himself be absorbed by the hive mind of the Thuruht nest, becoming ThurThul, however, after the defeat of the Lost Tribe of Sith and Abeloth, a group of Jedi sent by Luke Skywalker brought him back among his Jedi brothers.
            Raynar was born on the flagship of Bornaryn Trading, the Tradewyn. His family's home planet of Alderaan was destroyed approximately 10 years before his birth, and his parents and uncle kept the spirit of their homeworld alive by participating in family customs such as the Ceremony of Waters.
            Spoiled and boastful, Raynar took after his uncle Tyko Thul in personality. He was raised with the best of everything money can buy, but lacked physical affection from his family.
            At some point, Raynar was discovered to be Force-sensitive and sent to Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 to train his ability in the Force. Raynar was not a popular student at the academy, and was often found annoying fellow students by either interrupting Luke Skywalker's lessons with a lot of questions, or claiming to be superior in the Force to everyone else. The robes he wore were practically garish with bright, clashing colors. Skywalker would often understandingly answer at least some of the questions that were honestly good ones, but Raynar recognized that when Skywalker gave him a pointed look, it was time to put his hand down.
            During the Shadow Academy attack, Raynar's boasts about how good he was with the Force were proven wrong, as he was trounced by Dark Jedi who would have killed him had Zekk not thrown him into the mud and generally embarrassed him to save his life. From then on, he vowed to work harder on his mastery of the Force to back up his boasts. Following the battle, Raynar assisted in tending to the injured. Among those he attended was his old enemy Tenel Ka, who had recently been injured during a fight with the Nightsister Tamith Kai. As a result, he was befriended by Tenel Ka, the Solo twins Jacen and Jaina, and the Wookiee Lowbacca, all of whom had been his enemies previously.
            Shortly after the attack by the Shadow Academy, Han Solo told Raynar that Bornan Thul had gone missing. After offering to form a search party, Raynar was told to stay at the academy. As weeks went by without any word from Bornan, Aryn Dro Thul recalled her son to the flagship Tradewyn for his security and her peace of mind. After a traitor was discovered and dispatched, Raynar stayed aboard the ship for a few more weeks. Missing his new friends Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka, and Lowbacca, he got a ride back to Yavin 4 with the supplier, old Peckhum.
            After hearing about the Human-hating Diversity Alliance and its leader, Nolaa Tarkona, from former Diversity Alliance member Lusa, Raynar understood why his father disappeared on the way to meet Tarkona. Bornan Thul had acquired a navicomputer with coordinates to a plague warehouse that he was supposed to have given Tarkona, but found out what she planned to do with it and hid. Unfortunately, Bornan Thul had visited the warehouse, and Boba Fett (actually Ailyn Vel in disguise) had hacked into his navigation logs, found the coordinates, and turned them over to Tarkona.
            After being reunited with his father, Raynar, along with Zekk and the Jedi trainees, helped his father wire the warehouse with explosives. Unfortunately, The Diversity Alliance showed up, and Bornan Thul was exposed to a Human-killing virus in the ensuing confrontation. Raynar had to watch his father die hours after being reunited with him.
            After a mourning period, Raynar went back to Yavin 4 and built his lightsaber. He was also delighted to learn that Lusa, to whom he had become close, was now a full-time student at the Academy.
            During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Raynar's friend Lusa was killed by the voxyn on Chiron, leaving him devastated.

        <key>Tanivos Exantor Divo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.263.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tanivos Exantor Divo, more commonly referred to as Tan Divo, was a human male police inspector in the Coruscant Security Force on the Galactic Republic capital planet of Coruscant. During the Clone Wars that erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Divo was an active police officer who held the rank of lieutenant. He displayed both a pompous attitude and rigid, by the book approach to investigations. While Divo's conclusions might have been based on certain facts, his pride made him jump to conclusions before the case was fully investigated and all variables were considered. He was loath to accept opinions or information from anyone else, preferring his own theories. All of this combined to result in the detective's rather low success rate in closing his cases.
            Lieutenant Tan Divo was assigned to several notable cases including the kidnapping of the two daughters of Pantoran Chairman Papanoida. Though Divo made assurances of his ultimate success in the investigation, his team missed blood on the bottom of Papanoida's Icon of the Moon Goddess during a scan of the chairman's apartment on the planet Coruscant. This prevented Divo from receiving a vital clue to the identity of the kidnappers, and the case from Divo's perspective went cold.
            With the untimely death of Rodian Senator Onaconda Farr, a blood test revealed that he had been poisoned making it a murder investigation that was assigned to Divo. However, Senator Padmé Amidala was ill at ease with the inspector's dismissal of her attempts to assist and she decided to pursue the investigation on her own along with Senator Bail Organa. After they were attacked investigating Farr's movments at the docks under the derrick major, they returned with an angry Lieutenant Divo to the Senate Building where the inspector placed the senators under the protection of police and Senate Guards. At that point Farr's former assitant, Lolo Purs, came in saying she was attacked by Senator Halle Burtoni of Kamino, a rival of Senator Farr. Divo confronted Burtoni in the Chancellor's office and placed her under arrest for murder. However, Amidala voiced her concern with discrepancies in the case causing Purs to reveal that she in fact was the murderer. After a scuffle, Divo arrested Purs.
            Divo's daughter Andressa was an agent in the Imperial Security Bureau of the Galactic Empire, but Tan died on Alderaan in 0 BBY. The families role in law enforcement continued through Andressa's son Exantor, who became a police commissioner of the New Republic on Hosnian Prime.
            Tan Divo served as a police officer in the Coruscant Security Force which was the police department for the planet Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic. By the time of the Clone Wars which were fought between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Divo had risen to the rank of lieutenant and was working as an inspector, his low success rate on cases notwithstanding.[1]
            When it was discovered that the two daughters of the the Pantoran Chairman, Baron Papanoida, had been kidnapped, Divo was assigned the case. He and several police droids searched the Papanoida apartments, finding nothing seamingly amiss. Promising to continue investigating, the police left the scene. Papanoida discovered however, that one of his Icon of the Moon Goddess had been moved from its original spot and upon retrieving it, found the kidnapper's blood underneath. This clue allowed Papanoida to locate and retrieve his daughters with the help of Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Meanwhile for Divo, the case had gone cold.[3]
            After a speech by Senator Amidala, the proponents of the legislation—including Senators Onaconda Farr, Mon Mothma, and Bail Organa, along with Farr's assistant, Lolo Purs—withdrew to Amidala's office. While enjoying refreshments, Farr choked on his drink and died. The Coruscant Security Force was called in and responded to investigate the suspicious death and Divo was assigned as the inspector on the case. Samples were taken of the drinks, and the forensics report concluded that a poison had been given to the Senator, thereby classifying the death as a homicide. After the Senator's funeral, Farr's political allies were summoned to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's office in the Senate Office Building. There, Divo revealed that Farr had not died of natural causes but had in fact been murdered. Amidala suggested that Farr had been killed because of someone who was angry over the proposed military spending reduction bill. Divo was dismissive of that idea and told the senators to stay out of his investigation.[4]
            Not convinced by Divo's assurances, Amidala decided to pursue her own theory. She began by questioning Farr's political enemies, Senators Mee Deechi and Halle Burtoni. Deechi revealed that he had Farr followed to dig up dirt on the Senator and that the night before his death, Farr had gone to the Coruscant docks for a clandestine meeting. Though reminded by her friends that Divo had ordered them to stay out of the investigation, Amidala went to the docks with Organa. There, they were ambushed and shot at though they did not know the identity of the attacker. The disturbance alerted Coruscant police forces and they responded and secured the crime scene. After arriving on the scene himself, Divo expressed his annoyance at Amidala's actions that not only had she failed to inform him of her lead at the docks, but she had also made his job more difficult by alerting the killer to the fact that the investigation was closing in on the culprit. During the conversation, Amidala came to believe that Deechi might have been responsible for the attempt on her life, as he was the one who had told her about the docks. Though Divo tried to tell her to slow down, she ignored him, and the frustrated inspector followed her and Organa back to Deechi's office. There, they found Deechi stabbed to death in his chair.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tan_Divo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTanivosExantorDivo</string></dict>

In 2 BBY, Tyson was killed during the skirmish in the Archeon Nebula.
            Tyson[3] was a rebel pilot in Gold Squadron under the callsign "Gold Three". His squadron flew Y-wing starfighters. In 2 BBY, he and his fellow pilots escorted the former Imperial Senator Mon Mothma into hiding after she had denounced the Ghorman Massacre.[1] After Gold Squadron and Mothma's Taylander shuttle Chandrila Mistress[4] rendezvoused with the rebel cell Spectres's ship Ghost in deep space, Tyson and his fellow pilots began docking under the Ghost's cargo bay to refuel.[1]
            Tyson and Gold Squadron along with the young rebel pilot Ezra Bridger then skirmished with an Arquitens-class command cruiser and its TIE fighter escorts. During the skirmish, Tyson and his fellow pilots followed Gold Leader Captain Jon Vander's orders to fire their ion cannons at the light cruiser. They then bombed the ship with their proton torpedoes before fleeing into hyperspace with the Ghost, which was now carrying Mothma and her crew.[1]
            While traveling through the Archeon pass to Dantooine, the rebel convoy was pursued by Commander Vult Skerris' prototype TIE/D Defender, Vander sent Tyson and Gold Four to intercept the new TIE. However, the Y-wing pilots were unable to penetrate the new TIE fighter's powerful deflector shields. Skerris then shot down Tyson and Gold Four, killing both of them.[1]
            Tyson was a human man who flew with the rebellion's Gold Squadron in 2 BBY. He had dark skin, brown eyes, and black hair. Tyson wore an orange jumpsuit and helmet. He flew a Y-wing starfighter. While a competent starfighter pilot, he was no match for Commander Skerris' TIE Defender.[1]
            Tyson first appeared in Secret Cargo, the eighteen episode of season three of Star Wars Rebels. He was voiced by Phil LaMarr, who also provides the voice for numerous other star wars characters, most notably Bail Organa.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tyson_(Gold_Squadron)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTyson</string></dict>
        <key>Gregar Typho</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.265.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Captain Gregar Typho was a Human male who served as head of security for Senator Padmé Amidala during the Separatist Crisis and Clone Wars. A quiet, simple man native to the backwater world of Naboo, Typho made a name for himself as a Junior Palace Guard during the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, in which he fought with distinction, suffering several injuries including the loss of his left eye. Typho then became the personal bodyguard and security advisor for Padmé Amidala in 24 BBY when she abdicated the throne and became a Senator; he inherited the position from his uncle, Quarsh Panaka, who served as Typho's mentor for much of his life. Typho quickly fell in love with the Senator, but he knew their social castes were too different for any relationship to form. When Amidala's life came under threat in 22 BBY, Typho's paranoia of an assassination attempt coinciding with the Senator's visit to Coruscant to vote on the Military Creation Act saved her life, when a decoy handmaiden was killed in her place. Typho continued to serve Amidala during the Clone Wars, traveling on several diplomatic missions for her.
            In 19 BBY, Amidala went to Mustafar to find her husband, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker—and never returned. A mourning Typho attended her funeral, feeling guilty for having let her go to Mustafar in the first place. He ultimately decided to travel to Coruscant to find her killer and avenge Amidala's death, but it was months before he could get leave from his duties. During this time, he worked with former Jedi Ferus Olin against the Empire on Naboo. A year after the Declaration of a New Order, Typho finally made it to Coruscant, and eventually came to the conclusion that Amidala had been "killed" by Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith. Typho lured Vader into a trap and tried to kill him, but the Sith's command of the Force was too strong for him, and Vader killed Captain Typho.
            Gregar Typho was born over a decade before 32 BBY on the planet Naboo.[7] He was a stocky Human, powerfully built and very athletic.[8] His uncle, Quarsh Panaka, was a high-ranking officer in the Royal Naboo Security Forces, and Typho hoped to follow in his footsteps and serve as a guard to the planet's monarch. He was raised in the shadow of the Royal House of Naboo, and eventually got his chance to join the Security Forces, traveling to a number of offworld academies that Panaka had attended in the years prior, where he was given a rigorous training.[7] He became a Junior Palace Guard, and by 32 BBY had served for a number of years with courage and distinction, despite his youth.[1] Around the same time, Panaka became the head of the Security Forces and personal bodyguard of Queen Padmé Amidala after the death of King Veruna. Six months later,[9] the Trade Federation blockaded Naboo and eventually launched an invasion force. Amidala, a staunch pacifist, ordered that Typho and his peers to stand down and offer no opposition,[10] though many carried out resistance in secret.[11]
            Panaka and the Queen fled Naboo with the help of Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, though they returned with the intention of overthrowing the Trade Federation. While the Gungan species occupied the bulk of the Trade Federation's forces at the Battle of the Great Grass Plains, Panaka, the Queen, and the Jedi returned to liberate the capital city of Theed.[10] Typho, still a teenager,[8] fought alongside his uncle, helping to repel the Trade Federation and capture its Neimoidian leaders. He showed courage and tenacity in the line of fire, sustaining many injuries including the loss of his left eye.[1] Because of an accident of genetic programming, he was unable to use an eye cloned from himself, and had to make use with an eyepatch, which limited his vision.[3] Typho gained much notoriety for his efforts in the battle, and when Amidala stepped down as Queen and became the Senator of the Chommell sector in 24 BBY, Typho was appointed as her head of security, earning the rank of captain. Many accused Typho of using his family connections to secure the position, though he had earned it on merit alone: Panaka did not make the decision to select him.[7]
            Typho took his duty seriously and proved a diligent security chief, but he quickly grew to love Amidala. Knowing that their social castes were too different for them to ever become lovers, he kept his feeling secret.[3] Amidala trusted Typho completely, though she often ignored his advice and treated him poorly.[12][13] The former queen's term coincided with the Separatist Crisis, and a dangerous time for the Republic. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, led by former Jedi Master Count Dooku, was persuading many systems to secede from the Republic, and although she was relatively new to politics, Amidala became an important figure for the Republic. As a result, Typho felt the likelihood of any assassination attempts would only increase, and went about establishing as stringent security measures as he could. He adopted many of his uncle Panaka's most innovative practices, including using Amidala's handmaidens as decoys while she donned the attire of a handmaiden[7] or pilot.[6] In 22 BBY, Palpatine scheduled a vote on the hotly debated Military Creation Act to take place in the Senate two months later. Amidala intended to travel to Coruscant and oppose, though for a time beforehand she returned to her family on Naboo.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gregar_Typho/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGregarTypho</string></dict>
        <key>Cassio Tagge</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.266.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>General Cassio Tagge served as the head of Imperial Army operations aboard the Death Star battlestation in the years leading up to and including the Battle of Yavin. Born into the powerful House of Tagge, Cassio Tagge grew up on Tepasi with his three brothers—Orman, Silas, and Ulric, as well as his younger sister Domina, who was sent away from Tepasi by Orman at an early age. Boasting a tactically astute and cautious mind, Tagge had enlisted for officer training in the Imperial Military by 18 BBY, against the wishes of Orman, who had ascended to the position of Baron of the House of Tagge. Cassio Tagge ultimately ascended to the rank of general, and became an influential figure within the military, strengthening the organization's ties to his family's TaggeCo corporation, and holding sway with Emperor Palpatine himself. Tagge was ultimately followed into Imperial service by Ulric, and among the general's earlier assignments was the subjugation of the Fallanassi people on Lucazec—when the general failed, he managed to drive the obstinate people off their planet and into hiding.
            Tagge's military nous, combined with his standing with Palpatine and the House of Tagge's considerable influence on the Imperial capital world of Imperial Center resulted in him being given command of all Imperial Army activities on Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's Death Star. As the project was steered towards completion, Tagge was given numerous administrative duties, and developed a fierce rivalry with his Imperial Navy counterpart on the station, Admiral Conan Antonio Motti. Tagge also had to endure the presence of Palpatine's personal emissary, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, with whom he felt compelled to avoid direct confrontation, but was critical of nonetheless. Tagge's criticisms of Vader and the Death Star project reached a fever pitch in 0 BBY, when the battlestation's plans were stolen by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, an entity that Tagge controversially had great respect for. Tagge's own organization of the battlestation's defensive arrays proved inadequate against the Alliance's later attack on the battlestation at Yavin Prime, and the general perished along with Tarkin and Motti when the Death Star was destroyed by Luke Skywalker.
            Cassio Tagge was a Human male who was a member of the highly influential and noble House of Tagge,[1] an immensely wealthy and noble family that controlled the ubiquitous Tagge Company, as well as a bountiful mining operation.[2] Tagge grew up on the Core World of Tepasi, alongside older brothers Orman, who was groomed from an early age to ascend to the position of baron within the family,[1] and Silas, who was interested purely in scientific development. Tagge had another brother in Ulric, and a sister, Domina. By the time Domina was two years old, Tagge and his siblings were orphaned.[6] From this youthful age, Cassio Tagge displayed an interested in strategy.[1]
            By 18 BBY, Tagge had enrolled in officer training within the Imperial Military, against the wishes of Orman, who by that point had ascended to the role of baron of the House of Tagge and by extension was the head of TaggeCo. While in training, Tagge began to hear odd rumors concerning Emperor Palpatine and the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, concerning bizarre powers and rituals surrounding the pair. The young officer-in-training was particularly concerned by the stories around Vader's sudden rise to prominence within the year-old Galactic Empire, and was concerned when Orman began embroiling himself in Palpatine's affairs. Meeting on Tepasi, Tagge and his brother discussed Orman's recent meeting with the Emperor—the baron was confident that the New Order would prove hugely profitable for TaggeCo. The younger Tagge was nonetheless worried by the persistent rumors, but Orman was dismissive of Vader's influence, confident that he could turn the situation to his advantage and supplant the Dark Lord at Palpatine's side. Tagge's fears were not assuaged, and they ultimately proved well-founded—Vader visited Tepasi shortly thereafter, having learned of Orman's meeting with Palpatine, and blinded the baron with his lightsaber.[4]
            Exhibiting excellent leadership skills, Tagge rose through the ranks of the Imperial Army rapidly,[7] and soon held the rank of general,[2] despite a lack of support from the influential Lord Vader.[7] He proved a capable and astute officer who was disinterested in politics and heirarchy, and placed more stock in loyal service to the Emperor.[2] As such, Tagge eventually developed enough power and influence, combined with the favorable standing of the House of Tagge on Imperial Center, to hold sway with Palpatine himself.[5] The general came to be seen as an unlikable, imposing figure within the army's heirarchy.[8] Tagge was eventually followed into Imperial service by Ulric, who served with competence.[1] The general's positioning within the military also ensured that TaggeCo would have strong ties to the Imperial hierarchy, which the corporation profited from.[9] Among the minor engagements Tagge was involved in during this time were the Marasaln Conflicts, the Penhalla Contention and the Pioku Border Wars.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cassio_Tagge/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCassioTagge</string></dict>
        <key>Harron Tavus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.267.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Harron Tavus was a Human male lieutenant and later commander in the Republic Special Forces who fought in the Great Galactic War. He was friends with and fought alongside Jedi Orgus Din during the offensive in the Minos Cluster. Tavus was present when the reconstituted Sith Empire attacked the capital world of Coruscant and again fought alongside Din to repel the invaders, though they were ultimately unsuccessful. After the Treaty of Coruscant was signed, officially ending the war, Tavus accompanied Din on a diplomatic mission to Balmorra, during which they rescued Satele Shan and SP-99 from an adrift escape pod.
            As cold war skirmishes engulfed the galaxy Tavus, at that time field officer of the Havoc Squad, began to lose faith in the Galactic Republic. He was stationed on Ord Mantell during a violent civil war, fighting the Imperial backed Mantellian Separatist Movement, where he and his squad prepared and carried out their defection to the Sith Empire.
            Harron Tavus[3] observed the end of the Sith Empire's offensive in the Minos Cluster while serving as a lieutenant in the Republic Special Forces Division[2] along with the Jedi Orgus Din. They later reported this to the Galactic Senate on Coruscant, and were present when the Sith forces attacked the capital world. He fired at the emerging Sith troopers just as Din engaged Sith Lord Darth Angral in lightsaber combat. When Din disengaged from combat with the Sith Lord and headed for the Jedi Temple, Tavus followed him, only to find the temple in ruins.[1]
            Later, Tavus accompanied Din on a diplomatic mission to Balmorra in the wake of an incident precipitated by Din's former apprentice, Fortris Gall. While en route, they stumbled across a Republic escape pod at the same moment a Mandalorian cruiser was also approaching. Tavus warned off the Mandalorians, who refused to withdraw. Shots were fired, but Tavus and Din were able to recover the pod which held Jedi Knight Satele Shan and the droid SP-99. Shan updated her two rescuers on the Sith betrayal, and insisted that, after they notified Grand Master Zym, they attempt to rescue Master Dar'Nala, who was still a prisoner of the Sith Empire.[4]
            Soon after however, Tavus received a transmission from Master Zym who informed them that they had intercepted an Imperial communications transmission that revealed that Dar'Nala had been executed. Soon after, Tavus went to Shan's quarters to comfort her, for which she was grateful.
            Upon arriving on Balmorra, Tavus and Din were greeted by Master Buryn, who revealed that fighting on the planet had resumed. Meanwhile, Din had ordered Gall to go to Dantooine to assist in ending the fighting there, with whom Tavus and Shan tagged along. During the ride, Tavus talked with Satele about developing a relationship.
            Once they reached Dantooine, the commanding officer said Gall had already arrived and was helping them continue the battle against the Sith. Tavus agreed to leave the troops behind. He was later contacted by Gall to meet him at the ruins of the Jedi Enclave. When he saw SP-99 spying on him yet again, he shot and destroyed the droid.
            Later, Fortris Gall brought Tavus to the ruins of the old Jedi enclave where he revealed that he along with some other Jedi, not the Sith, were responsible for the bombing of the Senate Tower. Dar'nala, who hadn't been killed, then entered with a Wookiee bounty hunter named Dalborra, who was under her influence. Dar'nala was leading the group that wanted to disrupt the treaty to "save" the Republic. Tavus accused them of treason, but Dar'nala said that standing by while the Republic suffers under the treaty was the real treason. The trio then offered Tavus a chance to join them, since there were only a few more steps to take until Darth Baras would be framed as the one disrupting the treaty. Tavus agreed.
            The group met Darths Baras and Angral at the crystal caves where Satele soon arrived as well. Dar'nala was revealed to be responsible for the attack on the Envoy. Baras tried to turn Satele to the dark side but she resisted. Tavus had Angral beaten and was about to kill him when Satele told him to stand down, as by killing Angral he would merely be playing into the Sith's hands. An infuriated Dar'nala called them both traitors and stated Satele broke her heart, and she would break Satele's in turn by killing Tavus, whom she sensed cared about the Lieutenant. Gall blocked the strike, saving Tavus' life, and turning on the now quite mad Dar'nala.
            Dar'Nala was killed seconds later by Dalborra, who managed to escape the Dark Jedi's mind control. Satele gathered Tavus and Gall together and escaped the caves. They returned to the base, where Din announced that the Major in charge had finally seen reason and agreed to pull out.
            During the Cold War, Tavus became the commander of the elite Special Forces unit Havoc Squad. His squad consisted of his second-in-command Captain Zora (aka "Wraith") and Lieutenants Vanto "Fuse" Bazren, Bex "Gearbox" Kolos, and Ryler "Needles" Dorant. The squad eventually became disillusioned with the Republic, especially when the Senate chose to abandon him on Ando Prime. Thus, he chose to defect to the Empire. But in order to get into the Empire's good graces, he needed something of value.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Harron_Tavus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHarronTavus</string></dict>

        <key>Kennan Taanzer</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.269.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kennan Taanzer was a male Human Jedi Initiate within the Jedi Order during the time of the Clone Wars. Escaping the initial destruction of the Order during the early days of the Galactic Empire, Taanzer was taken under the care of Jedi Master K'Kruhk and Padawan Chase Piru as they fled the wrath of the Empire. After finding refuge on the planet of Arkinnea, Taanzer survived the formative years of the Empire and grew into a young man under the tutelage of K'Kruhk, Piru, and Zao.
            A Force-sensitive Human born to a family on Nadiem during the Clone Wars, Taanzer's father was killed during an attack on his homeworld by the Confederacy of Independent Systems After the family home was destroyed, Taanzer's mother, Crys Taanzer, attempted to flee with her son to the Galactic Republic's evacuation ships. Realizing that the probability of getting onto a ship was slim due to overcrowding, Taanzer's mother appealed to a visiting Jedi healer. The Ho'Din Jedi treated the boy's injuries and was impressed by how calm he was, which caused him to have his Padawan test Taanzer's blood, which revealed his Force-sensitivity. The Jedi offered to designate young Taanzer for priority evacuation, if his mother agreed to give him over to the Order, assuring her that her son would reach safety at the Coruscant Jedi Temple within two days. She agreed, and Taanzer was shipped off to begin training in the ways of the Force. His mother, Crys Taanzer, would later regret her decision after Order 66, believing that she had guaranteed her son's death.[1]
            Although his mother thought him to be dead at the Coruscant Temple, Taanzer had actually been transferred from Coruscant sometime before the end of the war. Assigned to the Hawkbat Clan upon joining the Order, Taanzer and his fellow Initiates joined their minder Jedi Master Du Mahn at the Order's training facility on Bogden 3, awaiting a transport back to the Temple which had been delayed due to the battle there. When Masters K'Kruhk and Sian Jeisel arrived with their clone troopers, Mahn ordered the Initiates to assist her Padawan Chase Piru in preparing a feast for the war-weary Jedi and their soldiers. In the hours after dining, the clone troopers received Contingency Order 66 from Coruscant which called for the execution of all Jedi. Opening fire within the training facility, several of Taanzer's unarmed peers were killed as their masters defended them, but K'Kruhk and Piru ultimately escaped with half a dozen Initiates to parts unknown. Two months afterwards, Taanzer was living with the group of younglings in exile under the tutelage of K'Kruhk on an unnamed moon.[1]
            Taanzer was present when the pirate Lumbra and his men came to the youngling's camp. When they noticed that their damaged ship had a piece that they needed, Lumbra proceeded to take it. As he approached the ship, Taanzer's peer Seddwia jumped at him saying that it was their ship and to leave it alone. Lumbra grabbed Seddwia by the arm and pulled her away, starting a conflict. Chase Piru jumped to her rescue, but was shot and believed dead. When Lumbra realized they were Jedi Initiates, they were chained up and on their way to be turned into the Galactic Empire. It was only the timely intervention of K'Kruhk and Piru that saved Taanzer's life and that of the other children at the expense of Lumbra and his men. Meanwhile, halfway across the galaxy, Taanzer's mother fell victim to the Rakghoul plague, ensuring that she would never know that her son was alive.[1]
            Following the attack on their camp, K'Kruhk ordered that the Jedi move from their unknown world to find more information about what had happened to the Order and the Republic. With Taanzer and the other younglings in tow, K'Kruhk piloted the group to the refuge camps on Arkinnea where they were promised a place in the resettled areas in the north. On their first night in the camps, the younglings were visited by Jedi Master Zao, who warned K'Kruhk that the group would have to flee immediately due to some unseen horror which awaited those who stayed.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kennan_Taanzer</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKennanTaanzer</string></dict>

Tyrell, who had been wounded in the battle, was approached by Dameron's wife Shara Bey during the celebrations and flirted with her as she asked where Dameron was. Before Tyrell could reply, Dameron interrupted, giving Tyrell a medkit and scolding him for flirting. The next morning the Pathfinders joined General Han Solo in capturing an Imperial holdout on the other side of Endor.[1]

Once the First Order reached the outpost, Ren commanded his forces during the Battle of Crait while standing over Tavson's shoulder. When the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker emerged from the outpost and survived a full barrage of all of the First Order's weaponry, the Supreme Leader ordered the shuttle land so he could confront the Jedi alone. General Armitage Hux initially objected to this idea, but after Ren used the Force to hurl Hux into a wall, Tavson quickly obeyed the command. Skywalker ultimately was revealed to have only been projecting an image of himself on to Crait using the Force, and while Ren was distracted by the projection the surviving Resistance members escaped.[1]
            Jober Tavson first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi,[1] which was released on December 15, 2017.[4] The character was not named in the film,[1] but received identification in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo[2] and released in conjunction with the film.[5] He is portrayed by Michael Jibson.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jober_Tavson</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJoberTavson</string></dict>
        <key>Dark Apprentice</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.272.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The "Dark Apprentice," also known as "Starkiller," was a clone of Galen Marek, a Force-sensitive Human male taken on by the Sith Lord Darth Vader as his secret apprentice. Following Marek's death, Vader embarked on a quest to create a perfect, obedient duplicate of the man to take Marek's place. Within the cloning facilities of Kamino, hundreds of failures were produced before the Dark Lord of the Sith succeeded in creating a clone of the deceased apprentice that was able to overcome his template's emotions and submit himself entirely to the dark side of the Force.
            As his training progressed, the Dark Apprentice surpassed all those who had come before him; he was able to store Marek's memories independent from his own and suppress the dead man's feelings. Vader planned to have the apprentice face a final test against a rogue clone of Marek during the Rebel attack on Kamino, but the Dark Apprentice did not participate in the battle, and his Sith Master was captured by the Alliance.
            Created on the ocean-covered world of Kamino[1] around 1 BBY,[2] the Dark Apprentice was a clone of Galen Marek, the deceased apprentice of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, grown as part of Vader's endeavor to create a perfect and obedient substitute to take Marek's place.[1] Several clones had come before him, all of which had been trained using memory flashes from the original Marek's life. These predecessors had failed to meet expectations in one way or another, either due to genetic defects or succumbing to their template's emotions, and were subsequently discarded.[2]
            Upon his awakening, presided over by Vader, the Dark Apprentice was confronted with Marek's memories, specifically the man's feelings for his former pilot, Imperial-turned-Rebel Captain Juno Eclipse. Immediately, he asked about her whereabouts, but Vader announced that she was irrelevant—all that mattered was what needed to be done. This, however, did not prevent the Dark Apprentice from inquiring about who Marek was in the future. When questioned, Vader repeatedly found it unnecessary to answer directly—rather, he stated the clone had inherited the memories, thoughts and dreams of a broken man, one far less powerful than the Dark Apprentice. As a side effect of the cloning process, he possessed both the skills and weaknesses of his genetic template.[1]
            The Dark Apprentice was trained in lightsaber combat against several Sith Training Droids. After viewing his progress, Vader showed him the cloning platforms in Timira City's clone spire, which displayed all of his rejected brethren locked up in stasis. The clone was determined to surpass all the others, but he was curious as to know how many had preceded him. Vader disregarded the question; instead, he told the Dark Apprentice that the only number that mattered was the quantity of clones that would be needed if he failed like the rest. Vader warned him that if he could not overcome Marek's emotions, he would fail like his predecessors.[1] Over time, the lead cloning technician noted that the Dark Apprentice was able to compartmentalize the memory imprints used to train him, thereby succeeding where all others had failed—the clone was able to store Marek's memories independently from his own, freeing him from his template's emotions.[4]
            With the apprentice free of Marek's memories, Vader brought him to a chamber where his template's lifeless body was kept. The clone understood the significance of the act, and his Master believed that he, unlike all the others before him, would prove successful. In a training match against the holodroids, the Dark Apprentice was able to rise above Marek's emotions, striking down a droid bearing the appearance of Captain Eclipse. To Vader, the clone revealed his disgust and hatred for his template's weaknesses, and his pride for being able to overcome them when those before him had failed. Satisfied, Vader replied that he was almost ready for his final test.[1]
            During the final stages of the Dark Apprentice's training,[1] a renegade clone of Marek, who had previously fled Kamino, joined with the Rebel Alliance in an attack on Timira City's cloning facilities.[2] Vader intended to use the battle as a final test for the Dark Apprentice[1] by drawing Starkiller into a trap atop the cloning spire.[2] Before leaving to confront Starkiller, Vader instructed the Dark Apprentice to wait until his assistance was required. The apprentice announced that he was ready to fulfill the purpose of his creation.[1] The trap did not go as planned, however. Starkiller bested Vader in a lightsaber duel but refused to strike him down,[2] having previously seen a vision in which he was killed by Vader's new apprentice—the reborn Starkiller—when he attempted to kill his opponent.[5] The Sith Lord was captured by the Alliance upon the battle's conclusion, with no interference from the Dark Apprentice.[2]
            Unlike the clones that preceded him, the Dark Apprentice was able to overcome Galen Marek's emotions, making him the lone success in a project filled with failures.[1] To the delight of the lead clone technician who observed his progress, the apprentice managed to isolate the original Marek's memories; as a result, the clone could differentiate between his own thoughts and those of his genetic template.[4] The Dark Apprentice grew to despise his template for his emotions and failures, ultimately feeling pride for rising above those weaknesses that had inhibited the clones who came before him.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Apprentice</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarkApprentice</string></dict>

Following a conspiracy against Darth Vader, Strephi, along with four other officers, were killed, with Vader stating that although he had suspicions on the conspirators, he would always survive.
            Joon Strephi was an human male who served as an Imperial officer in the Imperial Officer Corps. Following an attempted assassination on Darth Vader on Cabarria by bounty hunters, Vader ordered his droid to conduct an analysis of the origins of the kill contract as they were arriving on Coruscant. The droid stated that the contract came from the highest levels of the Imperial Executive Building, including the offices of Emperor Palpatine. The droid continued, and stated that there was a 97% probability that the signal originated from there, and that there was no evidence of slicing.[1]
            Vader then requested a list of individuals with access codes of Imperial systems that were above Level 1A1. On the list provided, Strephi's name was indexed there, along with the names of Corin Ferro, Wilhuff Tarkin, Cassio Tagge, Jer Croteau, Tomas Azoras, and Zorta Bingan. Following a second assassination attempt in orbit that resulted in Vader and the Ninth Sister crashing their starship, Vader met with the Emperor and meditated and discovered that Barokki was also involved, an officer he had force choked some time before. Following his meditation, he approached the Emperor with a likely solution.[1]
            Strephi, along with many other officers, were summoned to an auditorium on Coruscant. Vader believed that the conspiracy against him was because the officers did not understand why Vader was Emperor Palpatine's second in command. Following a brief speech by Emperor Palpatine that elaborated that Vader was his voice and second in command, Vader "randomly" selected Strephi, along with Ferro, Azoras, Barokki, and Bingan and killed them through the Force, and stated that although he had suspicions on the conspirators, he would always survive. Of those killed, Barokki was one of two officers that were involved in the conspiracy, the other, who was an individual with two missing fingers was not selected and thus spared.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Joon_Strephi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJoonStrephi</string></dict>
        <key>Streen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.278.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Streen was an elderly Jedi Master of the New Jedi Order. Originally a tibanna gas prospector from the planet Bespin, Streen had a powerful untrained Force empathy that caused him to be constantly affected by the thoughts and feelings of those around him. As a result, he sought out solace away from sentients, working his own private mining operation from the abandoned city of Tibannopolis. In 11 ABY, he was discovered by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who had followed clues of a Force-sensitive gas prospector. He offered to help Streen control his abilities and allow him to be a functioning member of society again. Streen agreed, following Skywalker to the newly established Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. During his training, Streen came into contact with the long dead spirit of the Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun, who seduced several of Skywalker's students, including Streen to do his bidding. However, Streen was able to overcome the Sith Lord's influence and worked with his fellow students to destroy Kun's spirit.
            Streen was eventually promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight and helped to defend the Jedi Academy from attacks by the Galactic Empire. As a Jedi Knight, Streen was involved in the mission to Corbos to defeat a Leviathan that had devastated a city on the planet. By 16 ABY, Streen was a Jedi Master, and during the Black Fleet Crisis, Streen was appointed as the temporary head of the Jedi Academy when Master Skywalker took a leave of absence. By the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Streen was still serving the Jedi Order on Yavin 4 as a teacher, but he became more involved in the war following the capture of Yavin 4 by the Yuuzhan Vong invaders. He fought in the final engagement of the war, which saw the Jedi victorious over the invaders. In the aftermath of the war, Streen accompanied Kirana Ti and Damaya to the planet Dathomir to establish a Praxeum and was later in attendance at the Funeral of Mara Jade Skywalker.
            A Human male from Bespin, Streen was a tibanna gas prospector, using his Force talents to detect eruptions of tibanna gas. Due to his untrained Force-sensitivity, Streen was able to sense when a cloud rich in gasses was about to erupt, allowing it to be siphoned. Although the main Bespin mining operations used computerized satellites to detect these clouds, Streen was still able to get there ahead of his competitors, using a makeshift floating platform to siphon the gas. Due to his uncontrolled Force-sensitivity, his mind was constantly bombarded with the thoughts and feelings of other sentients. When the Galactic Empire took over control of Bespin, the panic and fear of the residents gave Streen increased feelings of discomfort. This led him to seek a life of isolation in the abandoned floating city of Tibannopolis, where he found companions in the rawwks, airborne creatures native to the planet.[2] Streen knew about his Force-sensitivity, and on one occasion, he forced the smartest of his rawwks to do a dance for him. The experience disturbed Streen, and he stopped trying to manipulate the rawwks after his one time experiment.[11]
            Records of Streen's exploits eventually reached the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker who was planning to reestablish the Jedi Order. Realizing that Streen's precognitive abilities indicated that he had a measure of Force-sensitivity, Skywalker arrived on Bespin in 11 ABY at the city of Tibannopolis to give Streen his proposal. At this point, Streen was already advanced in years with graying hair. During their meeting, Skywalker was accompanied by Gantoris, another Force-sensitive who had agreed to train as a Jedi. Skywalker confirmed Streen's affinity for the Force by reaching into the older man's mind, receiving a Force-sensitive response to his probing. Although Gantoris and Skywalker requested for Streen to come with them, Streen was reluctant. To convince Streen of the powers that he could learn under him, Skywalker demonstrated the use of the Force by manipulating the rawwks, and teaching Gantoris to do the same. Convinced by the display, Streen agreed to come with them, attracted by Luke's promise to teach him mental discipline so that he could tolerate the company of other sentient beings. As they prepared to leave Bespin, Streen released his floating platform into the winds, declaring that he would not be returning.[2]
            Since Skywalker had not yet set up a place for training, the group made their way to Imperial City on Coruscant. While there, Streen was affected by the wealth of sentient minds on the galactic capital. To get away from their thoughts, he requested a solitary place to stay, and Skywalker gave him a room at the top of an abandoned skyscraper to simulate his living arrangements on Bespin.[12] Due to the great number of people on Coruscant and Streen's inability to block out their thoughts, Skywalker knew that he could not establish his Jedi Praxeum on the world, and they began searching for a more suitable planet. When Skywalker was called away to tend to a matter on Kessel, his sister, Minister of State Leia Organa Solo watched over Streen and Gantoris.[13] During this time, Streen became acquainted with Organa Solo's children, Jacen and Jaina, who were also Force-sensitive.[12] Eventually, Organa Solo and Skywalker decided on Yavin 4 as a place of study and Streen and Gantoris departed Coruscant for the new training facility.[14] Upon their arrival Streen and Gantoris helped Skywalker repair and refurbish the abandoned temples as future living quarters and training centers. They also cleared out the brush and foliage surrounding the Great Temple to make way for landing starships. Skywalker briefly departed Yavin 4 and returned with another student, Tionne, in her ship, Lore Seeker. Skywalker told the pair that Tionne was a Jedi historian and would be of great use in their future studies.[15] As their work continued, Streen and Gantoris explored the jungles of the planet, mapping it out for future training exercises. In their explorations, they discovered the Temple of Exar Kun and the power that emanated from it.[8] Unknown to Streen, Gantoris smuggled several lightsaber crystals from the temple when he wasn't looking.[16]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Streen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascStreen</string></dict>

        <key>Alto Stratus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.282.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alto Stratus was a Human male native to rain-soaked world Jabiim who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He was the leader of the Jabiim Nationalist Army, which was allied with the Separatists during the Clone Wars. He was not only a powerful and respected leader, but also a skilled and deadly warrior, who was eager to lead his troops in battle.
            Alto Stratus was born on the backwater planet Jabiim, and quickly became disillusioned with the Republic and the Jedi Order. When the Lythian pirates killed his parents, Trandoshan slavers raided his world and his people were decimated by the brainrot plague, Stratus never forgot that neither the Republic nor the Jedi sent aid to Jabiim in its time of crisis. Stratus' hatred of the Republic grew over time and he turned into a very vocal opponent of the Jedi. The outbreak of the Clone Wars only fuelled his anger, and caused Jabiim to secede from the Republic. He made several Anti Jediism speeches to the Jabiimites, reminding those gathered of the Republic's reluctance to intervene in the countless troubles Jabiim endured over the years. These speeches became popular on many Separatist worlds.[1]
            The Republic eventually reached Jabiim, though it arrived to stop the Jabiim rebels from granting the Confederacy mining rights to the planet's ore-rich core rather than to help its people. Stratus, with the help of Count Dooku's best assassin Asajj Ventress, battled the Republic constantly, isolating the Republic's Shelter Base by drawing their forces out into battle. However, he was using only his Jabiimite soldiers at this time; he was holding back his droid forces to attack Shelter Base itself. Stratus led the attack against Shelter Base, riding a pair of repulsor boots alongside his elite Nimbus commandos.
            During this time his unnamed female cousin was also killed; her legs were crushed by a Republic walker and she had been shot in the gut with a blaster. She died in Stratus's arms. Later he would ask blood for blood, and personally killed the Rutian Twi'lek Jedi Master Norcuna, leader of the Republic's invasion force.
            Shelter Base was destroyed in the battle, and Stratus even survived an attack by Anakin Skywalker. He retreated after the fall of the Republic base, though he was soon informed that his troops had cornered a group of Jedi Padawans. The masterless apprentices had been led into a minefield, and Stratus led the attack. Anakin attacked Stratus again, though a nearby explosion flung both to the ground, separating them before Anakin could strike Stratus down. Stratus was later rescued by one of his troops.
            The next attack was at Cobalt Station, though Stratus gained extra support in the form of powerful A-series assassin droids sent by Count Dooku himself. The Padawans again defended against Stratus' attack, although many were killed. Stratus himself stabbed one Jedi, though his leg was severed by another, Kass Tod. Badly injured, he became a prime target for Padawan Aubrie Wyn, who killed Stratus' last Nimbus guard. Then, wielding two lightsabers, Aubrie moved in for the kill, though Stratus was able to shoot her with a concealed blaster. Yet even this did not save him, for Aubrie fell atop Stratus as she died, plunging both blades into his chest. Both died, though the Jabiimites would still continue to fight the Republic and ultimately triumphed.
            Alto Stratus was a charismatic leader who chose to lead, not only from the front, but also through speeches. He gave several moving speeches prior to the Republic invasion of Jabiim where he was able to rally support for the Separatist cause.[1] Likewise, during the war he had numerous chances to give impassioned speeches to his soldiers to help fuel their morale while fighting in the killing fields of their homeworld.
            Alto was a skilled fighter who chose to fight with a sword, rather than modern weapons such as blasters. During the Second Battle of Jabiim Alto demonstrated his fighting prowess when he successfully killed an impressive number of Jedi in hand to hand combat. He even dueled Anakin Skywalker twice, and survived both duels. When mortally wounded Aubrie Wyn struck him down, he merely called both the Jedi and himself as casualties of war before dying.
            Alto Stratus and his Nimbus guards were named after types of clouds, fitting well in with Jabiim's climate. "Alto Stratus" is a Latin phrase used to designate a type of very high cloud. "Nimbus" means rain in Latin and is often used in cloud names (e.g. cumulonimbus and nimbostratus), so these troops would be specialized to fight in rainy conditions, like Jabiim.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alto_Stratus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAltoStratus</string></dict>

            Nova Stihl was assigned to the garrison on the penal planet of Despayre during the construction of the Death Star. An unarmed combat specialist and Teräs Käsi practitioner, he trained prisoners in the basics of self-defense. His goal with the demonstrations was to help the weaker prisoners defend themselves against the predators in the prison. Stihl had always been somewhat philosophical, and was also aware of his ability to anticipate his opponents' attacks, a skill which he called "Blink." While on the planet, he formed a loose friendship with Celot Ratua Dil, a Zelosian prisoner who aided him in his demonstrations.
            When violence on the prison planet lowered by twelve percent thanks to Stihl, he was transferred from the garrison to the Death Star in orbit. On the station, Stihl continued his self-defense classes. On a night out celebrating one of his squadmates' forthcoming engagement, he went to the Hard Heart Cantina. There, he was attacked by a drunk patron, whom he easily defeated in a short brawl. He then met the cantina's bouncer, Rodo, and he instantly recognized him as a fellow fighter. Rodo later interrupted Stihl after a class, and challenged him to a few rounds of sparring, although the fight ended quickly, when both men realized that they were evenly matched.
            During his time on the Death Star, Stihl had nightmares that revolved around him fighting off a group of men, sometimes alone, sometimes with the help of another. The dreams always seemed to end with his death. When he reported his nightmares to one of the Death Star's surgeons, Dr. Kornell "Uli" Divini, Uli discovered that Stihl had a midi-chlorian count of more than five thousand after the nightmares persisted, thus revealing Stihl was Force-sensitive. Nova was awoken one night during the destruction of Despayre, a test for the Death Star's superlaser. When he realized what had happened, he was shocked at what the Empire had done. He then encountered Celot Ratua Dil, who had escaped onto the Death Star, but decided not to turn him in, as they were all still recovering from Despayre's destruction. Stihl, because of his Force-sensitivity, sensed the deaths that occurred on Alderaan when the Death Star used its superlaser to destroy the planet. The effect of so many deaths in the Force knocked him unconscious. Nova decided then and there that the Empire was evil, no matter what excuses they might make, as there was no excuse for destroying a planet full of innocent civilians.
            Eventually, Stihl met Memah Roothes, the bartender of the Hard Heart who was Rodo's friend, an architect named Teela Kaarz, Villian Dance, an Imperial TIE fighter pilot, Atour Riten, chief librarian aboard the Death Star, all in the Hard Heart, where he also ran into Divini again. During a "hypothetical" conversation, the group decided that they could no longer be part of anything that could kill innocents on a massive scale.
            Following the destruction of Alderaan, Stihl was part of the guard detachment sent to hunt down and capture Han Solo and Chewbacca. He had previously received a Force vision in a dream of this experience and chased them, but a flash of Force-sensitivity convinced him to let them escape. Once they had cleared a set of closing blast doors, Stihl held the pursuers up long enough by claiming that the manual release was faulty and would not open the doors.
            The group planned to escape through a medical carrier, and got their chance during the Battle of Yavin. With the exception of Riten, who was forced to stay behind to ensure the others could flee, all of them attempted to escape. However, they encountered several guards outside the landing bay, and Stihl and Rodo had to stay behind and fight off an Imperial squad who tried to stop them. Stihl recognized the fight from his dreams, and knew what it meant. However, he continued fighting to allow the others to escape. He and Rodo defeated several troopers in a large fight using only their unarmed combat skills, fighting off a group of fifteen soldiers, but they were both killed, Stihl eventually succumbing to a blaster shot to the face.
            The novel Death Star describes Stihl wearing the 18-piece suit of stormtrooper armor and being one of the stormtroopers who chase Han Solo and Chewbacca aboard the Death Star. However, earlier the book calls him an army trooper. Elsewhere, his description seems to indicate he is one of the Death Star troopers in the Death Star conference room when Cass tells Grand Moff Tarkin the Rebels had deserted Dantooine. The authors of the novel seem to believe army troopers, Death Star troopers, and stormtroopers are identical, just wearing different uniforms, whereas previous Expanded Universe sources indicate they are distinct, the Death Star troopers belonging to the Imperial Navy (not Army) and the Stormtrooper Corps being a separate entity. It is possible the "Imperial Marines" represent an elite group that cross-trains in all three branches, although this is only speculation. In addition, the novel states that he is assigned the job only when a guard is sick and that he is not frequently given that task. In his case it is stated that they like having a soldier proficient in hand-to-hand as well as ranged combat.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nova_Stihl</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNovaStihl</string></dict>

            Following three consecutive failures of their joint cause, Dread Master Styrak went to the planet of Darvannis. It was there, from the shadows beneath Oasis City, that he corrupted the various mercenary and Cartel groups to defend him as the Empire/Republic tore through the Hutt seized world. When confronted, Styrak stood at his throne next to his prized pet, a kell dragon and behind a vast number of his Dread Guards. During the battle the Dread Guards were destroyed along with his dragon. Undaunted, Styrak took to the battlefield himself, using his mastery of the Force to fight the strike team. In desperation, Styrak revived his dragon and soon used it and his leeching powers to try and finish the strike team off. When his pet fell once more, Styrak used the last of his powers to grow to a god like size and began to rampage at the team, only to be struck down again.
            Styrak's death severely affected the Dread Masters, as their union required six members in order to maintain stability. After he was struck down, the Masters began to be overwhelmed with madness, and changed their plans from creating an Empire to slaughtering everyone in the galaxy, and then killing themselves,
            The Empire and the Republic attacked the Dread Masters' Palace on Oricon. After fellow Dread Master Brontes's death, the Masters' true base of operations, the Dread Palace, was attacked by both Republic and Imperial forces. During the final assault, the Republic/Imperial strike team fought the last four surviving Dread Masters. The Masters brought back the spirits of Styrak and Brontes to fight off the strike team while they recovered enough strength to resume combat. Styrak appeared with the apparition of his kell dragon and fought the strike force, only to be defeated again.
            Styrak possessed incredible power in the Dark side of the Force, and was responsible for the Dread Masters strength, which was gained through his rituals. A master of Sith alchemy, he was infamous for his experiments on both living and dead subjects. He was also the most individualistic of the Masters, and often pursued the group's goals on his own. This ultimately led to his own demise.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Styrak</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascStyrak</string></dict>

The two soon became an disciples of the Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr and they followed him to Mon Cala. However, they were soon found by Darth Vader who chased them to Bel City where Stell and Rebb stayed behind to slow him, and his team, down.
            Shortly after the founding of the Galactic Empire, Stell and Rebb witnessed their city get occupied by the new government. Rebb immediately expressed her hatred for the army of clone troopers taking over and refused to raise their children in a galaxy ruled by the Empire. Rebb subsequently convinced Stell to go against the Empire with her. A short while later, Rebb and Stell met an Iktotchi named Ferren Barr in a cantina. Barr claimed to be a Jedi Master,despite only being a Padawan,and told the two that he would give them a purpose in fighting the Empire. Rebb and Stell agreed to join him.[1]
            Barr took Rebb, Stell and four other disciples to Mon Cala where Barr began influencing the monarchy in their negotiations with the Empire. Barr's actions caught the attention of the Emperor, who sent Darth Vader to Mon Cala to investigate. Vader brought with him three inquisitors and a squad of Purge Troopers and upon arriving at Mon Cala, he witnessed the assassination of the Imperial ambassador Telvar.[3] The assassination kick-started an Imperial invasion of Mon Cala and Barr was soon notified of Vader's presence on the planet. Barr told Stell and the other disciples that Vader was really the Jedi Anakin Skywalker. Barr further explained to his disciples of how the Jedi Order believed in Skywalker and how Skywalker betrayed and destroyed them.[2]
            Shortly after, Barr was notified that Vader had discovered their location and was likely on his way.[4] Barr's first response was to evacuate his refuge and he set it to self destruct. The disciples left the refuge to find Vader and his team had arrived. Without hesitation they scattered, except for Nipaltoo who attacked Vader's submarine. Vader crushed Nipaltoo's helmet, killing him and the other vectored towards Bel City. Vader's submarine slowly caught up with them and Orvek turned around to slow him down. Orvek's sacrifice got them to Bel City alive and Rebb decided to stay behind in order to slow Vader even more. Stell pledged to stay with Rebb as Barr and the other two disciples fled down a corridor.[1]
            Stell was a Human male who had pale skin and green eyes. His hair was dark brown. Stell had spent most of his life with Rebb and was reluctant to leave her. Stell followed Rebb when she decided to go against the Empire and when she joined Barr. When Rebb decided to stay behind in Bel City, Stell did not hesitate to stay with her.[1]
            Stell first appeared in the canon 2018 comic Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 14: Burning Seas, Part II written by Charles Soule and pencilled by Giuseppe Camuncoli.[2] Although Stell's fate is left ambiguous, a flashback occurred subsequent to his final appearance. This was similar to flashbacks that occurred after the deaths of other acolytes.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Stell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascStell</string></dict>

            Staz was a human male[2] who, by 10 BBY, had achieved the rank of major in the Armed Forces of the Galactic Empire and was in command of the 224th Imperial Armored Division. Staz led the division during the Mimban campaign against the Mimbanese Liberation Army, who were resisting Imperial advancements.[1]
            During the campaign on Mimban, Staz commanded his forces to capture a final ridge in their area. After Corporal Han Solo had been blown to the ground by an explosion, Staz helped him recover and informed him that they were almost to their objective. When Solo replied with confusion on where they were headed, Staz stated that they were headed just over the final ridge. As Staz began to proclaim that victory was at hand, he was completely annihilated by an explosion and was killed.[1]
            Following his death, Solo was shocked and fell back to a trench, where he witness what appeared to be an Imperial officer, who would in actuality be Tobias Beckett with the uniform of a captain, who was on Mimban attempting to steal a Y-45 armored transport hauler for a heist on Vandor.

        <key>Anakin Solo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.292.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Anakin Solo was a Human male Jedi Knight of the New Jedi Order who was the third child of Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo and the younger brother of Jaina and Jacen Solo.
            Named after his grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, as a child Anakin often feared succumbing to the allure of the dark side and becoming a Sith himself. At the age of eleven, he attended the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, where he became fast friends with Tahiri Veila. Together, they enjoyed numerous adventures, which included freeing the imprisoned souls of Massassi children.
            Anakin was one of the pivotal figures in the Yuuzhan Vong War, participating in several of the major battles and developing effective tactics against the Yuuzhan Vong. As a result of his mission to rescue Tahiri and to help Vua Rapuung compel Mezhan Kwaad to speak the truth, the Jeedai heresy—a heretical movement that ultimately helped bring the end of the war—quickly spread among the Shamed Ones. Later, Anakin led the Myrkr strike team to end the scourge of the Jedi-killing voxyn, where he gave his life to end the threat.
            Anakin Solo was born to Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo on the world of Nespis VIII in 10 ABY, a year and a half after his twin siblings, Jacen and Jaina.[1] His birth was prophesied as early as 1000 BBY by a Jedi Master.[9] Originally, Anakin was to be named Han Solo Jr. after his father, but his mother, Leia decided to name the boy after his maternal grandfather, Anakin Skywalker.[10] She wanted to redeem her father's name, and she also thought she could overcome her fear of Darth Vader by seeing, through her son, what her father could have been.[11]
            Anakin was born during a time of great instability.[1] The New Republic was faced with the resurgent Imperial factions under the reborn Emperor Palpatine.[10] On one occasion, the Emperor touched Anakin while he was still in the womb. On another, he attempted to take over the body of the unborn child, in an effort to sustain his spirit in a more powerful form. However, the Emperor was killed, shot by Anakin's father, Han, before he could complete his plan.[12]
            Anakin spent the first year of his life on Anoth, an isolated planet which his uncle, Luke Skywalker, and the admiral of the New Republic, Gial Ackbar, had fortified to protect the Solo children. There, Anakin was tended to by nanny droids and his mother's best friend, Winter. His parents were allowed to visit every few months. At first his siblings, Jacen and Jaina, lived with him on Anoth but once they reached the age of two they went to live with Leia and Han on Coruscant.[13]
            In 11 ABY, an Imperial strike team led by Furgan, the ambassador of his home planet Carida, invaded Anoth trying to kidnap Anakin. Winter was able to kill most of the invaders by triggering the base's defenses and fighting the Imperials on her own. Eventually, Leia and Ackbar, who had been alerted of Furgan's plan, arrived and saved Anakin from the Ambassador's efforts. After the abduction attempt, Anakin went to Coruscant to live with his parents and siblings.[14]
            Since Leia became overwhelmed in trying to tend to both her motherly and political duties, she enlisted the protocol droid C-3PO's help in taking care of the twins and Anakin. The droid uploaded information regarding child-rearing into his memory banks and met the challenge with initial enthusiasm but mixed results. After Chewbacca returned from Kessel with Han, he also aided in raising the Solo children.[source?]
            During the Empire Reborn movement of 14 ABY, Anakin and his siblings were kidnapped by Lord Hethrir, the Imperial Procurator of Justice, who wanted to take advantage of their Force powers. During Anakin's captivity, he became attached to Tigris who was his nursemaid and Hethrir's son. Lord Hethrir attempted to sacrifice the Force-strong Anakin to a creature named Waru in exchange for Waru's help. However, Anakin's parents, along with his uncle Luke Skywalker, succeeded in rescuing the children, and Hethrir was destroyed by Waru.[15]
            When Anakin was a child he had recurring dreams of his grandfather Darth Vader. Because Anakin would not confide in Leia, she sent Han to talk to him. Anakin then asked his father what happened to Luke's hand. In order to get rid of Anakin's nightmares of Darth Vader and explain the story of Luke's mechanical hand, Han told Anakin about their adventures during the Galactic Civil War. However, instead of putting Luke in the story he used Luke's hand. When Han finished the story Anakin claimed that he was going to be Luke's hand one day and then went to sleep pitting his hands against his feet.[16]
            In 18 ABY, Anakin accompanied his family on a vacation to the Corellian system. After their arrival, Leia hired a Drall named Ebrihim to tutor the children and act as a guide for the whole family. On their first outing, the family visited Corellia's first major archaeological site. While there, Anakin and his siblings became separated from the rest of the party because Anakin stopped to investigate something he had sensed through the Force. He tracked this sense with his siblings following him and eventually arrived at what would later be identified as Corellia's planetary repulsor, one of which was located on each of the five inhabited planets of the Corellian system. Later, the children told their parents what they had found in the tunnel.[17]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Solo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAnakinSolo</string></dict>

            A Force-sensitive Human, Sors Bandeam was given to the Jedi Order for education in the ways of the Force. Sorted into a clan at the Coruscant Jedi Temple, Initiate Bandeam remained at the Temple as many of his instructors fought and died during the Clone Wars.[1]
            When Supreme Chancellor Palpatine betrayed the Order in 19 BBY by issuing Contingency Order 66, Initiate Bandeam was present with his clan at the Temple when the 501st Legion marched up the Processional Way. Seeking refuge in the High Council Chamber high atop one of the Temple's towers, he and his peers were pleased when Jedi Anakin Skywalker walked into the chamber. Believing the famed hero was there to save them from the attacking clones, the children were caught unaware when the Jedi-turned-Sith ignited his lightsaber and slew the younglings after Sors asked Skywalker. Indeed, Skywalker had fallen to the dark side of the Force and was now known as Darth Vader.[1]
            Sors Bandeam was played by the uncredited Ross Beadman in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the final installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy.[1] The character's name is actually a curious anagram of his portrayer's name.[2]
            Beadman got the role after his mother contacted a casting agency, which sent her an e-mail saying that there was a casting call of child actors for Episode III. To prepare for the role, Beadman saw all three films of the original trilogy in VHS tapes before actually getting the part of Sors Bandeam. The character's name was created by the agency and was written in the e-mail response about Beadman getting the part.[2]
            Originally, Sors Bandeam was to have an unspeaking part in the film, but the casting director eventually opted to have Beadman say the line "Master Skywalker, there are too many of them! What we are going to do?".[2] This can be proven in the film's illustrated screenplay: there, all the younglings present at the room said the line before Anakin proceeded to slaughter them.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sors_Bandeam</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSorsBandeam</string></dict>

He hailed from Corellia and became a smuggler in the employ of Jabba the Hutt, even completing the Kessel Run in just twelve parsecs with his prized ship, the Millennium Falcon. He was the son-in-law of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, husband of Princess Leia Organa, brother-in-law of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, father of Ben Solo, rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler Lando Calrissian, and best friends with the Wookiee Chewbacca, his trusted co-pilot who swore a life debt to the Corellian smuggler. Solo ran afoul of Jabba after ditching a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, owing the Hutt a great deal of money as a result. His fortune seemed to have changed when he agreed to charter Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to Alderaan, but he became caught up in the rebellion against the Empire and, after helping Leia Organa escape from the Death Star, briefly fought in the Battle of Yavin, which allowed Skywalker to destroy the superweapon. Solo fought with the Rebellion for a number of years afterward, taking part in numerous operations and battles against the Empire.
            After the Battle of Hoth, Solo sought refuge with Organa—with whom he had fallen in love—Chewbacca, and C-3PO on Cloud City, which was operated by his old friend Lando Calrissian. There, they were captured by the Sith Lord Darth Vader as part of a trap to bait Skywalker to the city. Solo was frozen in carbonite and taken to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, where he remained encased in carbonite for months until he was rescued by his friends. After returning to the Alliance Fleet, Solo was promoted to the rank of general and was given command of the Pathfinders, a special forces squad, for the Battle of Endor. Solo led the Pathfinders to Endor, where he, Organa, Chewbacca, and the special forces team, with the help of the native Ewoks, destroyed the shield generator protecting the second Death Star that was being constructed in orbit. Their actions allowed the Alliance Fleet to destroy the superweapon.
            The Battle of Endor, which saw the deaths of Emperor Sheev Palpatine and Darth Vader, allowed the Rebellion to form the New Republic. In the early days after Endor, Solo continued to lead the Pathfinders against the Empire. He married Organa, and the two had a son, Ben Solo. The boy struggled with the dark side of the Force—like his mother, who was the daughter of Darth Vader and twin sister of Luke Skywalker, Ben was Force-sensitive—so Organa sent him to be trained as a Jedi by Skywalker. He was seduced to the dark side by Snoke, Supreme Leader of the First Order, resulting in the destruction of Skywalker's attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order.
            Having lost their son, Solo left and returned to smuggling, and even lost the Millennium Falcon to numerous thieves. He continued to smuggle until he was brought back into the fight by a scavenger named Rey and a defected First Order stormtrooper named Finn, who carried with them a droid, BB-8, that had part of a map to Skywalker's location. Solo, who retrieved the Falcon from Rey and Finn, returned to Organa, who led the Resistance against the First Order, and fought in the battle to destroy the First Order superweapon known as Starkiller Base. During the battle, Solo saw his son, who had taken the name Kylo Ren, and tried to convince him to return home. Instead, Ren stabbed his father with his lightsaber. Mortally wounded, Solo fell to his death in the bowels of the Starkiller weapon.
            Han was born on the planet Corellia during the waning years of the Galactic Republic[18] around 32 BBY.[2] Sometime after he became famous, it would be rumored by an Snivvian bounty hunter that Han was actually a descendant of the Prince-Admiral Jonashe Solo, a member of the ancient Corellian royalty.[19] During his formative years, his father worked in the Corellian Engineering Corporation shipyards, building vessels such as YT-1300 light freighters until he was laid off. Solo's father wished he could leave Corellia on such a ship, but was never able to afford to. According to Han, he was never close with his father.[8] At one point his father brought him to the freighter factory where he worked. His father pointed out that the ships being built there were his contributions to the galaxy, but that they ultimately didn't matter. His father advised him that he wasn't meant to build ships, but rather to fly them.[20] His father later abandoned him.[11] At some point he met the Ithorian Pjolan.[21]
            Sometime after his father died,[18] Han became involved with the criminal gang White Worms, serving as a scrumrat. Here, Han met fellow scrumrat Qi'ra.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Han_Solo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHanSolo</string></dict>
        <key>Kam Solusar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.296.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kam Solusar was a Jedi Knight who turned to the dark side of the Force, but was brought back to the light side through the efforts of Luke Skywalker. After his meeting with Skywalker, Kam became one of the first students to study at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. Later on he became a Jedi Master and married fellow Jedi Tionne. He was also the genetic template for the clone Alpha.
            The son of Ranik Solusar, a Jedi Master slain by Darth Vader, Solusar spent many years hiding from Vader's Dark Jedi. When discovered, Solusar was tortured until his spirit was broken, and then converted to the dark side of the Force. He was stripped of the memories of his former life. After training as a Dark Jedi, Emperor Palpatine selected him as a personal warrior on Byss, part of the Dark Side Elite. On Vjun, Vill Goir taught Solusar lightsaber combat techniques.
            Solusar first encountered Skywalker on Nespis VIII circa 10.5 ABY. Sensing great strength in Solusar, Skywalker was determined to turn him back. With great difficulty, Luke helped Solusar to cast off the chains of the dark side and embrace the light side of the Force as he was intended to by restoring his memories.[3] Now loyal to Skywalker, Solusar traveled with the Jedi Master to Ossus to assist the Ysanna in their battle against Imperial forces. He was made a general of the New Republic Defense Forces; after defeating an Imperial army and two Dark Jedi, Solusar led a raid on the reborn Emperor's flagship and sabotaged it.
            The two Jedi parted ways after the defeat of the clone Emperor, but were reunited on Yavin 4 with the establishment of the Jedi Praxeum in 11 ABY. Although older than the other Jedi candidates, Solusar proved to be one of Skywalker's strongest apprentices, eventually becoming a full Jedi Knight.
            During his years on Yavin 4, Solusar fell in love with the Jedi historian and minstrel Tionne. The two got married in 18 ABY.[2]
            The friendship between Solusar and Skywalker grew deep enough that Skywalker asked him to preside over his Jedi wedding to Mara Jade in 20 ABY. He performed the first wedding ceremony, and at the second ceremony he helped subdue attackers so that the wedding could continue.[4]
            When Skywalker departed the Praxeum to assist in sporadic intergalactic conflicts, he left Solusar in his stead as administrator of the Academy.
            Solusar held the view that the light side was the only true aspect of the Force, and that the dark side was only the Force's hollow shadow.
            During the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Kam and Tionne took on the responsibility of guarding the young Jedi students of the Academy. When the Peace Brigade attacked the Academy in the invasion's second year, Kam hid the children and protected them until Anakin Solo and Talon Karrde arrived.[5] The children were loaded onto the Wild Karrde, and then the Errant Venture, and cleared a path to a new home at the forgotten Maw Installation. Kam and Tionne also scouted the Deep Core to find a secondary location for another Jedi base. They chose the world of Eclipse.
            After Eclipse had to be evacuated, Kam and Tionne remained with the Academy students for the duration of the war, far from the frontlines.
            At the conclusion of the Yuuzhan Vong conflict, Kam recommended that Skywalker reestablish the Jedi Academy and New Jedi Order on the ancient world of Ossus, which Skywalker agreed to. Afterwards, Kam went on to be part of the Masters' Council.
            During the Second Galactic Civil War, Kam and Tionne were the caretakers of the Academy on Ossus. Following the death of Mara Jade Skywalker, many of the Jedi Masters left for Coruscant to attend her funeral, leaving Kam and Tionne in charge of a handful of Jedi Knights and Padawans. Jacen Solo, who by this time had assumed the Sith title of Darth Caedus and seized control of the Alliance, sent members of the Galactic Alliance Guard to Ossus, ostensibly to protect the Academy from terrorists, but in reality to keep the Jedi in check by threatening the Padawan learners. Kam and Tionne were unable to stop them.[6]
            When the Jedi later deserted the Galactic Alliance, Darth Caedus ordered the execution of the Masters and Knights. Some were downed with coma gas, while others were shot by GAG snipers, and the Padawans were rounded up in an outdoor area. Kam and the few other Jedi remaining were forced to remain in hiding and watch until they knew the full extent of the situation.[6]
            Tionne Solusar, however, went to confront the Major in charge of the operation, Salle Serpa. Serpa begin shooting off her limbs with a blaster, attempting to draw the remaining Jedi out of hiding. Kam eventually broke from his cover, and was shot by three sniper blasts, seriously wounding him.[6]
            Against all odds, Kam survived all three hits to the chest and began recovering on Endor along with Tionne.[7]
            Shortly after the end of the Second Galactic Civil War, Jedi Jaden Korr discovered an old Imperial cloning facility, which contained a mad clone of Kam Solusar, named Alpha.[6]
            Kam was one of many Jedi accompanying Grand Master Luke Skywalker when members of Galactic Alliance Security and a contingent of bounty hunters arrested him in 43 ABY. Kam activated his lightsaber and deflected several stray blaster bolts into the ground to protect Luke and the others. Skywalker was forced to agree to a deal with Chief of State Natasi Daala, that saw him exiled from Coruscant and forbidden to interfere in Jedi affairs. In his place, Daala instituted Kenth Hamner as interim Grand Master of the Jedi Order and head of the Council.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kam_Solusar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKamSolusar</string></dict>
        <key>Dalla Solo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.297.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dalla Solo, also known as Dalla Suul or Dalla the Black, was a Human male of Corellian ancestry who became a notorious pirate around the time of the Clone Wars. He was sometimes said to have been the rightful heir to the Corellian throne, and the grandfather of Han Solo, but it is not clear whether either of these claims was correct.
            Dalla was born on Duro, the son of Korol Solo, who claimed to be the descendant of Berethron e Solo, and who was executed for his pretensions to the throne. Korol's son assumed the pseudonym Dalla Suul to disguise his identity, and carved out a career as a pirate and kidnapper, earning the nickname "Dalla the Black". His illegitimate daughter was the mother of Threkin Horm, but Han Solo's father, Jonash Solo, was said to have been his firstborn, and legitimate, son.
            If Dalla the Black was indeed Han Solo's grandfather, he was probably also the man known in the Corellian system as Den Solo, who disappeared with his infant son during a pirate raid on Tralus, and whose daughter Tiion Solo became the mother of Thrackan Sal-Solo.
            Sometime following 0 BBY, Dalla had set up a little camp in the remote Agrilat crystal swamps on Corellia. When a spacer found him there, Solo told him that he was searching for a new partner. If the spacer would help him with a problem, Solo would consider showing the spacer his trade. He sent the spacer to kill a Gran named Yensi Kolyin, but when the spacer returned successfully, Solo withdrew his offer and told the spacer that he needed to think about it some more.[2]
            In The Courtship of Princess Leia, See-Threepio says that Dalla was born "nearly sixty years" before 8 ABY; but for him to be Han Solo's grandfather with a birth date of around 50 BBY, both he and his son would have had to have sired children in their early teens.
            However, this is one of a number of comparable instances where Corellians' ages seem implausibly young: some fans believe that these statements should be retconned as references to a longer calendar year used in the Corellian system.[source?]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dalla_Solo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDallaSolo</string></dict>

        <key>Slavin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.299.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Slavin was a male human Imperial officer who served as a captain during the Imperial occupation of Ryloth. He served under Grand Admiral Thrawn when several members of the Phoenix Cell attacked Ryloth to retrive the Syndulla clan's Kalikori. Slavin was a rival of Cham Syndulla, the leader of a rebel group that he fought on Ryloth, and as such took an opportunity to capture Syndulla's daughter Hera during the attack.
            Later on, Slavin was summoned on board the Chimaera to be interviewed as part of Thrawn's investigation into the identity of a rebel spy in the Imperial ranks. Some time after, he was in command of a Star Destroyer sent to the Tonnis sector to pick up a giant kyber crystal for delivery to the construction site of the Death Star. However, the freighter carrying the crystal had been set to explode by Saw Gerrera. When the crystal blew, it destroyed his destroyer, killing him.
            In 2 BBY,[source?] Slavin fought the Free Ryloth movement under General Cham Syndulla. At first, Slavin and his troopers' attacks were clumsy. However, Slavin was able to make his attacks swifter and more precise when the Chiss Grand Admiral Thrawn arrived. Slavin and his forces were then able to occupy the Tann Province. There, Slavin established his headquarters in Syndulla's home.[2]
            Later, Cham's daughter Hera Syndulla and her fellow rebels Chopper and Ezra Bridger infiltrated the Syndulla residence in an attempt to retrieve the Kalikori, a priceless Twi'lek artifact that belonged to Hera's late mother. Hera and her rebel team had managed to retrieve the Kalikori from Cham's office and tried to sneak out through the front door. However, Captain Slavin entered the building with Thrawn and two stormtroopers. After ordering the stormtroopers to stand guard, Slavin told Thrawn about the recent rebel attack at Tulara Ravine. Despite having increased operations, Slavin was perplexed at why the rebels were attacking far from their base. At that point, Thrawn sensed movement behind the separators and remarked that the rebels were nearer than they thought.[2]
            After a failed attempt to escape through the basement, Hera and her team made a second attempt to go through the front door. Chopper, who was disguised as an Imperial astromech droid, tried to distract the stormtroopers while Hera headed to the door. However, Hera ran into both Slavin and Thrawn. Mistaking Hera for a servant, Slavin told her to move out of the way and reprimanded her for leaving the kitchens. Hera apologized and turned to retreat. However, Thrawn took an interest in her and ordered his men to arrest her. Ezra, who was disguised as a scout trooper, cuffed Hera.[2]
            Slavin followed Thrawn and Hera into his office. There, Hera pretended to be an impoverished servant who wanted to steal the Kalikori only to feed her family. Slavin wanted to make an example of Hera. However, Thrawn deduced that the Kalikori was more valuable then Slavin realized and asked the Captain if he understood the significance of the object. When Slavin described the Kalikori as a "primitive trinket," Thrawn pointed out that it was a priceless Twi'lek heirloom.[2]
            When Thrawn questioned Hera further, Slavin disparaged the Twi'lek woman as a mere servant. At that point, Hera spoke up and told the Imperials that her people would never give up their struggle to be free. Slavin was about to chastise Hera when Thrawn scolded him for embarrassing himself. Thrawn then pointed out that the servant was none other than Hera Syndulla, the daughter of the Twi'lek rebel leader Cham Syndulla. Thrawn then stunned Ezra after the scout trooper made a sudden move. Slavin was shocked that Thrawn had outed Hera's rebel colleague and asked how he knew. Thrawn coolly responded that the rebels always had friends around them.[2]
            Slavin later accompanied Thrawn to Hera's cell where Thrawn talked about the significance of the Kalikori. When Slavin interjected again, Thrawn apologized for his colleague's behavior and thanked Hera for her "hospitality." After leaving the cell, Thrawn gave Slavin orders to deliver the Kalikori to his Arquitens-class command cruiser. When Slavin suggested destroying the object, Thrawn lost his temper momentarily and grabbed Slavin by the collar of his tunic. Thrawn then apologized and lamented that Slavin did not appreciate art like he did. He then departed to observe an "experiment" while leaving Slavin in charge of further operations.[2]
            Assuming command, Captain Slavin contacted Cham via hologram and offered a deal. If Cham agreed to surrender himself by dawn, he would free his daughter Hera and Ezra. If he refused, Slavin threatened to execute the prisoners. Cham agreed to the deal. Slavin then proceeded with the second stage of his plan which involved positing gunners around the hangar bay to trap the Ghost, the VCX-100 light freighter that served as the base for Hera's rebels. However, Chopper discovered Slavin's plans and alerted Hera, who ordered the droid to steal explosives from the Imperial armory and plant them around her house.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Slavin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSlavin</string></dict>

            Snapit disliked using his lightsaber and usually wielded a hardened wood staff, as it had a longer reach. He discovered three young Force-sensitive Humans on the world of Somov Rit—"Tomcat", "Bug", and "Rain". They were taken to Ruusan, where the Jedi Army of Light was currently battling the Sith Brotherhood of Darkness. While in transit, they were attacked by Sith fighters, and narrowly escaped.
            Once on land, the Sith were not far behind, and Torr held them back so that the children could escape. Slicing a rope bridge with his weapon once they were safely across, he fell down the canyon along with the hoards of Sith minions. Tomcat climbed down to try and retrieve Torr's lightsaber. Torr was still alive, and urged Tomcat to leave the weapon with him, but he could only watch in dismay as the boy took it anyway.

            At some point during the Clone Wars, Terrinald Screed lost his eye and had it replaced with a cybernetic one.[2]
            By 14 BBY, five years after the end of the war and the transition into the Galactic Empire, Vice Admiral Screed had joined the Naval Intelligence Agency and occupied a high position in its hierarchy. He was present alongside other Imperial officerss, including fellow Naval Intelligence officer Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit, on Coruscant when Moff Wilhuff Tarkin arrived to give his report about the attack on Sentinel Base.[2]
            Along with Rancit, he requested a meeting of the Joint Chiefs following another rebel attack on Galidraan Station, and argued that the rebel cell posed a much more serious threat than was believed by ISB Deputy Director Harus Ison. However, he was proven wrong in his prediction that the next target would be Nam Chorios, instead of Lucazec. He was again duped when it was discovered by Tarkin and Darth Vader that his colleague Rancit had been a traitor cooperating with the rebels the whole time, having fooled both him and Ison, although this information was kept secret from Screed and others in Naval Intelligence.[2]
            Screed was later promoted to admiral, and he led forces of the Imperial Navy in driving the Iska pirates from Fanha before decisively defeating them at Tosste. This feat was remarkable enough that it became mandated learning in Imperial Academies, including the one on Arkanis.[3]

        <key>Darth Skotia</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.304.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Skotia (pronounced /ˈskoʊʃə/, occasionally /skoˈteˈa/) was a male Human who lived during the era of the Great Galactic War. Skotia was a native to the worlds of the reconstituted Sith Empire and was an active member of the Sith Order as a Force-sensitive warrior. At some point during his career, more than half of Skotia's natural appendages and organs were replaced with cybernetic machinery, including his right eye and many neural transmitters. Regardless, by the time of the Cold War between the Empire and the Galactic Republic, Skotia had been elevated to the position of Sith Lord as a member of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge and was in command of a cadre of Trandoshan warriors who had sworn to protect the Sith as bodyguards. Under the auspices of his superior, Darth Thanaton, Skotia maintained offices within the Sith Sanctum in the Imperial Citadel on the capital world of Dromund Kaas and gained guardianship over the ancient Sith hollowed ground known as the Dark Temple. Skotia was stationed on Dromund Kaas when the newest servant of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge arrived on planet—the young and ambitious Sith apprentice, Zash. The progressive Sith witch quickly developed a heated rivalry with the cyborg Dark Lord who, along with Thanaton, detested Zash's lack of deference to her historical predecessors. Skotia very deliberately attempted to impede her ascendance, but the aspiring Sith Lady ultimately earned Lordship and was granted supervisory powers over Sith Acolyte training.
            Skotia's rivalry with Zash continued until around 3643 BBY, at which point the Darth discovered that Zash, who had succumbed to the draining effects of the dark side of the Force, was seeking to use hidden power within the Dark Temple to achieve immortality through an ancient and dangerous Force ritual. The Dark Lord promptly forbade Zash from entering the Temple and ordered the destruction of her new apprentice, who had just completed the trials of Korriban. Skotia's assassination attempts on the apprentice failed, allowing Zash an opportunity to use her new student as a means of eliminating her old rival. Skotia tried several times to confound his enemy's plans, but Zash's apprentice overcame the Dark Lord's efforts and confronted the cyborg in his chambers in the Imperial Citadel. Although Skotia was confident he could kill the apprentice, the young Sith managed to undermine the Dark Lord's control of his Trandoshan guardsmen and even wielded a cyber neutralizer device that disrupted and deactivated Skotia's control of his prosthetic body parts. The elder Sith was slain by the apprentice, thus fulfilling Zash's designs and allowing the Sith witch to accrue more influence on Dromund Kaas and advance towards her ultimate goal of immortality.
            In 3643 BBY, Skotia learned of Zash's attempts to unlock the secrets of an artifact of Tulak Hord. He sent one of his apprentices, Ortosin, and two agents to assassinate her new apprentice on Korriban but they failed. When the apprentice arrived on Dromund Kaas, Skotia intercepted the Inquisitor at the spaceport and attempted to intimidate them. News of this infuriated Zash. Knowing that she couldn't kill Skotia, for a power play would make the Dark Council nervous, she decided to dispatch her apprentice, Kallig, instead to infiltrate Skotia's base, which was guarded by Skotia's army-sized force.
            Gathering a tablet that would force Skotia's Trandoshan bodyguards, Skeesk and Skarsk, to abandon him and a cyborg prototype disruptor that could disable someone who is 50% or more cyborg, the Apprentice confronted Skotia in his chambers with Khem Val and the Sith Lord. He killed the bodyguards when they turned on him, but the cyborg disruptor greatly weakened him enough to be killed. The cyborg was defeated, and his cybernetics weakened him from the dark side, and he was no match against the powerful Inquisitor. With his last breath, Skotia realized that Zash must have spent years plotting his demise, and realized that the Sith would always betray one another. He warned her apprentice that she would turn on her/him before he died.
            News of Skotia's death didn't go unnoticed. Darth Thanaton accused Zash of murdering Skotia but couldn't prove it as many could claim that she was in the Nexus Room Cantina the whole time. Zash was then elevated to Darth and gained access to Skotia's position and assets.
            To receive the title of "Darth", Skotia must have had considerable power, enough to outmatch a Sith Lord at least. Even Zash recognized that he'd be near impossible to defeat without the mechanisms/weapons her apprentice gathered. When his bodyguards turned against him, he showed his incredible abilities with telekinesis discarding of them rather easily. He was also proficient with Force rage, enacting it during his duel with the apprentice. Even though he was weakened considerably by Zash's apprentice's weaponry, he still presented a challenge in the lightsaber duel that ensued when he attacked the apprentice but was ultimately defeated and slain.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Skotia</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthSkotia</string></dict>
        <key>Tol Skorr</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.305.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tol Skorr was a male Human Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic in the final decades of the Republic Classic era. Taking the rank of General within the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, Skorr was seduced to the dark side of the Force early in the conflict and he joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, becoming one of Count Dooku's Dark Acolytes.
            Discovered to be Force-sensitive at an early age, Tol Skorr was delivered to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. Passing through the Temple's academy, Skorr went on to complete formal training when he succeeded in his Trials of Knighthood and was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council. Beginning his independent studies, Skorr was sent on missions by the High Council and became a good lightsaber duelist. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems in 22 BBY, Jedi Skorr reported to Coruscant where he received the rank of General within the newly created Grand Army of the Republic. On an early mission, Jedi Skorr was sent to track a band of pirates over Korriban. His starfighter was shot down in a dogfight and the man was nearly killed by a Tuk'ata. As Skorr lay injured, he was rescued by Confederacy leader Count Dooku; to whom Skorr pledged his life.[1] Seduced to the dark side of the Force by Dooku, who was in fact the elusive Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Tyranus, Skorr abandoned the Jedi Order and his role in the war, becoming one of Dooku's deputies alongside fellow fallen Jedi Kadrian Sey and Sora Bulq. Constructing a red-bladed lightsaber, Skorr's new allegiance was made known to the High Council. Rivaling Sey as Dooku's most favored, the two joined together to attack Quinlan Vos, a seemingly turncoat Jedi who wished to join Dooku's army. Engaging Vos, the two Acolytes were soundly defeated and Sora Bulq escorted Vos into the Count's chambers. Shortly after Vos was admitted into Dooku's retinue of Dark Acolytes, the group traveled to Tibrin to overthrow the pro-Republic dictator and take the planet for the Confederacy. Standing by Dooku's side, Skorr watched in silence as the planet's ruler, Suribran Tu, was decapitated by the Sith Lord's lightsaber.[1]
            Soon thereafter, the group ventured to Kiffu where Dooku confronted Sheyf Tinté Vos within her palace. When Dooku announced his intentions to depose the Sheyf, she ordered her guards to capture or kill the assassins. Skorr engaged the Guardians along with the others, slaying them one by one as they attacked in force. Competing with Sey to reach the Sheyf first, Vos leaped over both and abducted the old ruler. Slaying Sey on his way out of the chamber, Dooku ordered Skorr to remain to kill the rest of the Guardians while he found Vos. Quickly departing Kiffu once the Sheyf was murdered, Dooku sent Skorr and Vos on a mission to Korriban to fuel the competition between the two. Ordered to retrieve the Holocron of Heresies, the ancient holocron of Darth Andeddu, the pair set out to scour the tombs of the ancient Sith Lords. Lying in wait as Vos retrieved the artifact, Skorr challenged the Kiffar for possession of the ancient data crystal. Dueling briefly with Vos, Skorr came face-to-face once more with the Tuk'ata that had scarred his face when he first crashed on Korriban. Escaping together, Skorr fell short as he leaped for Dooku's shuttle; however the Count rescued him with the Force. Journeying to Dooku's base of operations on Bakura and then to Coruscant, Skorr waited with Dooku in The Works district as Vos assassinated Senator Viento on behalf of the Confederacy. After receiving Vos' report, Dooku and Skorr departed.[2]
            Fourteen months later, Dooku was displeased with Vos' repeated failures and assigned Skorr to partner with Sith assassin Asajj Ventress to kill the Kiffar Dark Acolyte. Tracking Vos, the pair managed to trap him aboard the ruined Intergalactic Zoological Society's ship, the Titavian IV and pitted him against several deadly droids. When Vos managed to activate his beacon transceiver, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi located the ship and helped Vos counter the droids. When Ventress' Morp droids led the two Jedi into Skorr's trap, the Nightsister attacked Kenobi while Skorr beat Vos in hand to hand combat. Distracted by a rancor released by Kenobi, the Jedi were able to flee to the hangar deck where Vos boarded the Skorp-Ion. As Ventress and Kenobi fought, Skorr piloted a starfighter to chase Vos but was ultimately gunned down inside the hangar. Surviving the wreck, Ventress and Skorr regrouped as the Jedi escaped. When General Grievous answered the Dark Jedi's distress beacon, Ventress ordered Skorr to go with the cyborg and report to Dooku while she dealt with unfinished business between Kenobi and Vos.[3]
            Near the end of the war, Skorr accompanied Dooku to the world of Saleucami to oversee the development of a Morgukai Shadow Army by the Anzat Rath Kelkko. As the Confederacy began to lay siege to the planet, Skorr went into the seedy regions of the world to meet with Khaleen Hentz, Vos' lover. Threatening her by strangling her with the Force briefly, Skorr attempted to create a schism between Hentz and Vos, in order to cause his long time rival to make mistakes. Leading Morgukai in battle against the Republic, Skorr encountered Vos on the battlefield and engaged him, leading him deep into a cave. Once out of sight from the battling armies, the two disengaged each other and met with Dooku and Bulq in the underground labs of the Anzati. While Dooku assigned Vos to hunt down Jedi Master Tholme who had successfully sabotaged parts of the Morgukai project, Skorr continued his role as leader of the armies on the surface. Operating under the call name Red Tide, Skorr was instrumental in giving the all clear to Master Bulq to continue with his plan to assassinate Jedi Master Oppo Rancisis, leader of the Republic's war effort on the planet. As Bulq murdered Rancisis, Skorr engaged Jedi K'Kruhk, Sian Jeisel, and A'Sharad Hett in battle to arouse suspicion that Vos had killed the Thisspiasian Jedi Master.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tol_Skorr</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTolSkorr</string></dict>
        <key>Fi Skirata</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.306.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Fi Skirata, formerly known as RC-8015, was a clone commando member of the Galactic Republic's Teroch Squad, and later Omega Squad, serving as the team medic and sniper in both.
            Fi began his life on Kamino, like every other clone in the Grand Army of the Republic, and spent his early years training under Kal Skirata. His first deployment was to Geonosis, during the first battle of the Clone Wars. Due to Jedi incompetence, all three of Fi's squadmates were killed during the battle, which led to his being reassigned to Omega Squad with RC-1309, RC-1136, and RC-3222, three other commandos who were also the sole surviving members of their squads. Fi was the first of the newly formed Omega Squad to report for duty, although he and his new sergeant, Niner, would have a tense first meeting. Fi would go on to become an integral and valued part of Omega Squad. His sense of humor and generally sunny outlook would help to ease tensions in the squad through difficult times, a trait which greatly helped the squad in their first mission together.[1]
            His first mission with Omega Squad was on Qiilura. There he worked with Darman, Niner, and Atin to sabotage the Separatist base. Darman, who had ejected late from the crashing Narsh sprayer, met with Jedi Padawan Etain Tur-Mukan and joined back with Fi to finish the mission and capture Ovolot Qail Uthan. He also liberated some Mandalorian armor from the decapitated corpse of Ghez Hokan, who met his match in Etain. This mission also showed a major weakness of the beefed up Katarn armor, anything fired from a Verpine gun and a major weakness with EMP grenades.[1]
            When the terrorists on Coruscant had kidnapped a few hostages and planted a bomb on Jedi Master Kaim's corpse, Fi laid himself on the charge, saving lives of all non-armored personnel in the bomb's blast radius. He later stated that every clone in his place would do the same. That day he also met Ordo for the first time and, despite the commando's pun about the Null's kama, the two befriended in a very specific way—Fi was always joking about the kama and Ordo was hitting him as a welcome gesture; for anyone who didn't know them, it looked like a conflict between the two clones.
            Fi's actions also earned him the gratitude of Jaller Obrim. Jaller often reminded Skirata and Omega that he owed Fi a drink for saving their lives.[2]
            He was later sent to Coruscant, with the rest of Omega Squad and Delta Squad, to perform a black ops and anti-terrorism mission. Fi used a Verpine sniper rifle during this mission. He and Sev went on two recon excursions—the first of which where they kicked off a gang war and took a hostage; the second of which Fi clamped a remote detonator to a speeder while Sev dislocated his shoulder.[2]
            Around two and a half months later, Fi and Omega were sent to Gaftikar to help the Marits overthrow the Gaftikari government, as the Marits had no say in the government. During the recon stage of the mission Omega Team encountered the rogue ARC, A-30 (Sull), eventually setting him free. Fi kept the former ARC trooper's kama to add to the armor taken from Hokan.
            During the engagement on Gaftikar, he suffered a severe head injury which caused a coma while he and his squad attempted to secure a HoloNet news studio which was airing propaganda in an attempt to encourage citizens to fight back at the Republic forces. He was placed in bacta, but when he was taken out, the med droid pronounced him brain-dead and took the respirator tube out of his throat, which would have officially killed him if Fi hadn't suddenly started breathing on his own.[3]
            Bardan Jusik got him admitted into the Republic Central Medcenter's neurology unit under the name of Fi Skirata, finally giving the man a full name, and Besany Wennen went there to keep an eye on him. However, the medical droid there also pronounced him brain-dead and attempted to euthanize him. Wennen put the pistol Mereel had given her to the droid's head and threatened to shoot if the droid didn't help Fi. The droid called security, and Wennen called Kal Skirata. Skirata called Jaller Obrim, who then went with Anti-Terrorism Unit and moved Fi and Wennen to his house.
            Obrim had rented a med droid to look after Fi, who was unresponsive to stimuli. Fi remained there until Jusik, using the Force to repair Fi's brain injury, was able to bring him out of the coma. Besany returned to her office and reported to the GAR that RC-8015 had died from severe head trauma. Fi was a free man for the first time in his life, at a terrible cost.[3]
            Although Fi regained consciousness, he was far from the man he was. The head injury left him with limited speech and muscle control. His sense of humor also seemed gone, replaced by depression and a feeling of loneliness. He was taken to Skirata's bastion on Mandalore with Skirata to recover his strength and continue to heal. No longer a soldier of the Republic he instead wore the gear he had scavenged from Hokan and Sull. Rav Bralor's niece Parja took an interest in Fi and helped with his therapy to begin walking again and regain his strength and coordination.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fi_Skirata</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFiSkirata</string></dict>
        <key>Prudii Skirata</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.307.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Prudii Skirata, formerly known as Null-5 or N-5 was one of twelve Null-class ARC troopers created for use in the Grand Army of the Republic as a lieutenant. Due to the genetic tampering, Prudii and his five brothers had slightly improved muscular structures, eidetic memory, and an enhanced intelligence that was at least a 35% higher intelligence score over the ordinary clones.
            When he and the other Nulls were two years old, Kal Skirata saved them from termination by the Kaminoan clone scientists. After that, they remained loyal only to Skirata.
            After the First Battle of Geonosis, Prudii and his brothers were scheduled for chill-down because they were uncommandable except by Kal Skirata. Skirata saved them from chill-down and eventually the Null Squad became Clone Intelligence Units (MILINT) who worked for the Special Operations Brigade under the command of Jedi General Arligan Zey; as well as Kal Skirata's "private army", searching for the Kaminoan clone technician Ko Sai in order to force her to stop the age acceleration process.
            Prudii specialized in sabotage of droid factories. After installment as military intelligence unit, he spent the first year after Geonosis with sabotaging major droid factories throughout the galaxy, visiting 49 different planets and possibly interrogating and assassinating an important Separatist metallurgist who gave him vital clues on the metallurgic structure of droids. Instead of blowing the factories up, he developed a technique that couldn't be detected by Separatist quality control. Mereel used to call this technique "Prudii's patented droid remover". He wore specialized ARC trooper armor with stealth coating that couldn't be detected by droids and thus enabling him to enter droid factories unnoticed. He then sliced the main computers and slightly changed the recipe for creating droids by adding 5% extra carvanium. On the battlefield, these droids crumbled when hit with any weapon. His sabotage acts were so successful that the kill ratio for clone troopers in the field was raised from 1:20 droids to 1:50 droids during the first year of the Clone Wars.
            460 days after Geonosis, he trained clone commando RC-3222 on Olanet in his sabotage technique. Together they entered the droid factory on Olanet, which was regarded as a high value target by military intel, and sliced the main computer. Atin then returned to his squad at Coruscant HQ and introduced Omega Squad to the new technique while Prudii continued his work. In addition, he then joined his brothers in the search for Ko Sai.
            At the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Prudii extracted to Kal Skirata's haven of Kyrimorut on Mandalore.
            "Prudii" means "shadow" in Mando'a. He was completely fluent in Mando'a because Kal Skirata taught this language to all his Null ARCs, together with the Mandalorian culture.
            Atin described Prudii as a "glib cynic" (as well as adoring son when facing Kal Skirata). Prudii hated being called "Sir" or "Lieutenant" by other clones because he was of the strong opinion that all clones were brothers—even the Alpha ARCs, who always appeared to have some personal differences with the Null ARCs. Atin had the impression that Prudii looked slightly older than his brothers Ordo and Mereel.
            Prudii wore the Phase 1 ARC armor with the blue markings due to him having the rank of Lieutenant and later went on to wear the 1.5 experimental armor. With the equipment he had, he carried two DC-17 hand blasters along with the DC-15a blaster rifle.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Prudii_Skirata</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPrudiiSkirata</string></dict>
        <key>Mereel Skirata</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.308.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mereel Skirata, formerly known as Null-7 or N-7 and better known as Mereel, was a lieutenant and one of six Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos created for use in the Grand Army of the Republic. He was named after former Mandalore Jaster Mereel, Jango Fett's mentor.
            At the chronological age of two, he and his fellow Nulls were brought before the Kaminoan scientist Orun Wa, bounty hunter Jango Fett, and Sergeant Kal Skirata for review. When the Kaminoans attempted to terminate the Nulls, he snatched Skirata's holdout blaster and tossed it to his brother Null-11, nicknamed Ordo, who leveled it at Orun Wa. Skirata managed to get the weapon back, and received command of the Nulls as he was the only one who could control them. After that situation, Kal Skirata brought the Nulls up as sons.
            Mereel and the other Null-class ARCs, though they worked for the GAR, Grand Army of the Republic, were constantly hunting for clues as to the location of the Kaminoan scientist Ko Sai so they and Kal Skirata could find out how to stop the clones' accelerated aging.
            Mereel participated in the black op in 21 BBY, led by Skirata, to destroy the Separatist terrorist cells operating on Coruscant along with his brother Ordo, Walon Vau, Delta Squad, Omega Squad, Etain Tur-Mukan, and Bardan Jusik.
            A few months later, he participated in an unauthorized mission to Kamino. Disguised as a normal clone trooper, he accessed the Tipoca City computer mainframe for any information on Ko Sai. Although he didn't find any, he did succeed in downloading part of a secret conversation between Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Prime Minister Lama Su, that revealed that secret cloning facilities had been set up on Coruscant and that the Republic wasn't planning to order any future batches of clones from Kamino.
            As the search for Ko Sai intensified, Mereel´s single-minded patience paid off and led to the capture of the Kaminoan scientist. Not having happy memories of her, Mereel reintroduced himself to Ko Sai with his nerf prod, causing Kal Skirata to worry that Mereel would lose control. Of all the Nulls, Mereel had been the most carefree and charming, and it was because of these traits that Kal choose him for this delicate part of the mission.
            Later, Mereel would work with Etain to make Ko Sai create a cure for the clones' accelerated aging, while becoming a journeyman expert himself in genetics. When Ko Sai finally came to the end of her rope and hung herself, Mereel gathered his brothers to "prepare" the body for shipping. Mereel´s trademark smile, an indication he didn´t have a care in the galaxy, never faltered.
            Mereel would later desert with the rest of the Nulls shortly after Order 66 was issued, and would start anew with his brothers on Mandalore. When Kal nearly broke down after seeing Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy (nicknamed Scout), because of her looking similar to Etain, Mereel helped Kal back inside of their home. Mereel also managed to get along with Kina Ha, the Kaminoan Jedi which was amazing as he hated all Kaminoans. Like the other Nulls, Mereel was disgusted with the release of the virus FG36 by the Empire on Gibad, and plans with them to hide in the water reservoir or the fuel tank of Nyreen Vollen's ship, Cornucopia to avoid Imperial inspection once they retrieve Darman Skirata and Niner Skirata from Coruscant.
            Mereel was the most “charming, entertaining, and sociable” of the Nulls, and was relatively well adjusted to life outside Kamino. A ladies' man, his romances tended to be minor and brief. Thanks to his influence, Corr also behaved in this manner.
            Mereel was able to easily cope in most social situations. At one time he “held court” in the Coruscant Security Force Staff and Social club, entertaining commandos and CSF officers alike by reciting swear words in other languages. He reacted to many situations in a calmer manner than his brother, Ordo, and had a good sense of humor, often joking around or making witty remarks.
            Mereel was frequently described as a “daredevil lunatic”, a trait that often caused his "father" and brothers occasional anxiety. He sought out thrills, purposely skating on thin ice in everything from negotiations with techs to piloting and rapid-roping. Kal noticed that Mereel seemed to feel the need to take risks and excel in order to edge out of Ordo's shadow.
            He also shared many traits with his Null brothers. He had a peckish appetite, and a sweet tooth, which Skirata theorized might be due to his maturation, and the metabolic need to fuel his rapid aging. Due to the Kamioans genetic tinkering, Mereel and the other Nulls had very intense loyalties- either they would die for you, or you would end up dead. Like his brothers, Mereel was loyal only to Kal Skirata, and his family.
            The Kaminoans changed the Null's genes so that Mereel and his brothers had perfect memories. This often came in handy during Mereel's work, allowing him to memorize codes, manuals, and other information. These abilities eventually lead to his specialization in slicing and genetics. However, the same genetic tinkering, paired with his brutal childhood lead Mereel and the other Nulls to possess a fierce, resounding hatred of Kaminoans.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mereel_Skirata</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMereelSkirata</string></dict>
        <key>Kal Skirata</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.309.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kal Skirata, born Falin Mattran—sometimes called Kal'buir (Mando'a for "Papa Kal") by the clone commandos that he trained— was a Human male Mandalorian instructor who trained clone commandos in the Grand Army of the Republic during the time of the Separatist Crisis. After being orphaned, he was adopted by Munin Skirata. As Skirata grew up, he became the husband of Ilippi Skirata, the biological father of Tor, Ijaat, and Ruusaan Skirata. He would also become the adopted buir of Omega Squad and the Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos, RC-1136 of Omega Squad, and Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan, and ex-Jedi Knight Bardan Jusik. He was also the adopted grandfather of Venku Skirata.
            Falin Mattran was born on the planet of Kuat, the son of a Kuat Drive Yards engineer and his wife. When Mattran was around 6 years old, his family had moved to Surcaris because his father was contracted to do some engineering on the KDY warships that were stationed there. War had broken out on Surcaris shorty after the Mattran family had arrived on the planet, and Falin was orphaned when both of his parents were killed. The only thing he had salvaged from his father's body was a three-sided knife, and because he was alone after his parents died, he trained himself how to use it, eventually getting to the point where he could hit any target he threw the knife at.
            After surviving for a year in the war-torn rubble of Surcaris on his own, Mattran was discovered by a Mandalorian named Munin Skirata, whom he had promptly attacked with his father's knife. Munin was amused by the attack rather than angry, and decided to adopt Mattran into his Mandalorian clan, renaming him "Kal Skirata"—with "Kal" meaning "Blade" in Mando'a[1]—and took it upon himself to train young Kal.
            Skirata later married a non-Mandalorian, Ilippi, with whom he had three children: Tor, Ijaat, and Ruusaan. However, she had trouble dealing with his long absences and refused to allow him to take their eight-year-old sons into battle with him, per Mandalorian tradition. Ilippi eventually left him, taking with her all three children. Early in his career as a mercenary, his ankle was shattered by a Verpine shatter gun due to his failure to follow an order. The injury would later become a grievance for most of his career, only being healed after his adopted clone sons forced him to undergo surgery.
            When Jango Fett was recruiting the Cuy'val Dar, Kal was recruited due to fellow Cuy'val Dar, Walon Vau's recommendation. He and Jango went back a long way, and had an up and down relationship. Kal was a very aggressive Mandalorian traditionalist and was devoted to the welfare of his troops.
            When Ilippi died, Kal's sons tried to find him, to let him know. However, because of the extreme secrecy surrounding the existence of the clone army, he could not contact them and after they couldn't find him to come to their mother's funeral, they parentally divorced him. This was something that was considered a great disgrace among Mandalorians, but Kal felt that it was worth it, for the safety of the clones he had now become quite attached to.[2]
            Eight years before the Battle of Geonosis, Kal was brought to Kamino when he answered Jango Fett's call for trainers for the clones, joining the ranks of the Cuy'val Dar—literally "Those Who No Longer Exist" in the Mandalorian tongue. He was disgusted with the Kaminoans' arrogance and indifferent attitude toward the "reconditioning" (a euphemism that often meant killing) of clone children who didn't pass quality control standards.[3]
            Kal first met the Nulls when the Kaminoan technicians considered them failures that would be destroyed. Null-11 and Null-7 attempted to defend themselves and their brothers with Null-7 stealing the hold out blaster Kal kept within his boot, and Null-11 aiming at Kaminoan, Orun Wa. Though Kal cared little for the fate of the Kaminoan scientist, he managed to talk Null-11 down for fear of repercussions toward the boy.[3]
            Kal became sympathetic to the clones, and took the Nulls under his wing, giving them names and training them personally, instilling the heritage and values of the Mandalorians in them. The Nulls, in return, were very fond of Kal, and would only answer to or accept orders from him alone. He also formed alliances and contacts with many other Cuy'val Dar while there, forming a "closer" relationship with Walon Vau, Wad'e Tay'haai, Mij Gilamar, Rav Bralor, Dred Priest, and many other Mandalorians.[2]
            With the Battle of Geonosis, Kal's contract as a Cuy'val Dar was finally over. But when the battle was won and the Null ARCs were expected to be put into stasis, they resisted and took control of an entire barracks block. Skirata had to be called in under willing CSF arrest to help calm down the Nulls, but he helped on the condition that he would be re-enlisted in the Grand Army of the Republic and there would be no punishment for the Nulls.[4]
            One year into the war, with several recent terrorist attacks on GAR facilities, Skirata assembled a secret black ops team consisting of himself, fellow Cuy'val Dar Walon Vau, clone commando squads Delta and Omega, Null ARCs Ordo and Mereel, and Jedi Generals Etain Tur-Mukan and Bardan Jusik. The team's objective was to locate and eliminate the Separatist terror cells operating on Coruscant.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kal_Skirata</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKalSkirata</string></dict>
        <key>Anakin Skywalker</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.310.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Anakin Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic and the Chosen One of the Force. During the Clone Wars, his accomplishments as a battlefield commander earned him the Hero With No Fear moniker. After turning to the dark side of the Force, he became known as Darth Vader—Dark Lord of the Sith and apprentice to Emperor Darth Sidious. As a Sith Lord, Vader turned against his former comrades and hunted the surviving Jedi into near extinction. He became an enforcer of the Galactic Empire, who worked to crush the Alliance to Restore the Republic for opposing his Sith Master's will. Yet despite his actions as Darth Vader, a glimmer of the light side of the Force remained within the former Anakin Skywalker.
            Skywalker was born in the year 41 BBY before moving to the Outer Rim planet Tatooine during the Age of the Republic. Although he had a mother, the slave Shmi Skywalker, the truth about his parentage was that Anakin had no father—leading Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn to suspect that Skywalker's conception was the work of the midi-chlorians. Recognizing the boy's unprecedented connection to the Force, Jinn was determined to see Skywalker trained as a member of the Jedi Order, the task of which ultimately fell to his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi following Jinn's death in 32 BBY. Over the next decade, Skywalker rose to become one of the strongest Jedi in galactic history. While he was both caring and compassionate, his fear of loss was ultimately the catalyst for his downfall. In 19 BBY, with the Clone Wars nearing conclusion, Skywalker succumbed to the temptations of the dark side, believing the Sith had the power to save the life of Senator Padmé Amidala, his secret wife. Christened "Darth Vader" by his new Master Darth Sidious, the newly-minted Sith Lord assaulted the Coruscant Jedi Temple, killing fully-trained Jedi and novice younglings alike. After assassinating the leaders of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Vader was confronted on Mustafar by his one-time friend and mentor, Kenobi, resulting in a lightsaber duel that left Vader burned and mutilated. As a consequence of his defeat, he was rebuilt as a cyborg and encased in a life-sustaining suit of armor, further distancing the persona of Vader from that of Anakin Skywalker. In addition, Amidala's death in childbirth broke the fallen Jedi Knight's heart, leaving him more machine than man mentally as well as physically.
            Throughout the Dark Times, the former Anakin Skywalker brought fear to the galaxy in his capacity as the Emperor's dark enforcer. However, in spite of his deep immersion in darkness, Vader never succeeded in fully killing the side of himself that was Skywalker. His confrontation with his son, the aspiring Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, during the Galactic Civil War awoke the compassion within the Sith Lord, causing Vader to renounce his allegiance to the Sith in order to save Luke from the Emperor's wrath. By killing his Master, however, Vader sustained critical damage to his armor, making death inevitable. Resigned to his fate, his dying wish was to see his son with his own eyes for the first and final time. In the end, he died not as Darth Vader but as Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One who brought balance to the Force by destroying the Sith. His destiny fulfilled, Skywalker's consciousness was able to endure beyond death due to his sacrifice and redemption, allowing him to live on in spirit alongside his deceased Jedi mentors, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Grand Master Yoda. Yet the legacy of Vader also survived through Kylo Ren, his grandson by Princess Leia Organa. As Vader's descendant, Ren believed it was his destiny to complete his grandfather's legacy: the annihilation of the Jedi Order.
            Believed to have been conceived by the midi-chlorians,[16] Anakin Skywalker was born to the slave Shmi Skywalker. Skywalker and his mother were originally owned by Gardulla the Hutt until she lost them to the Toydarian Watto in a podracing bet when Skywalker was around age 3. The two then moved to the desert world of Tatooine. Affectionately nicknamed "Ani," he worked in his master's shop, located in Mos Espa.[7]
            Even at a young age, Skywalker exhibited exceptional piloting skills, and built the protocol droid C-3PO, specially modified to withstand Tatooine's sand and heat,[17] for his mother.[7] Once, while he was working in Watto's scrap yard, he found a broken servomotor he thought he could repair and use on the droid he was building and asked his master for it. With a glance, Watto saw that it was worthless and grunted that he could, but as Skywalker walked away, Watto told him nothing was free, and had him work harder the next day.[17] Skywalker got the photoreceptors for the droid at a market in Mos Espa. Though a Gran wanted them too and chased him through the market, Skywalker escaped by destroying an Ithorian's stall and blocking the Gran's pursuit.[18] He was close friends with fellow slaves Kitster Banai and Wald, as well as the elderly Jira. He also built his own podracer.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAnakinSkywalker</string></dict>
        <key>Wurth Skidder</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.311.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wurth Skidder was a Jedi Knight who died during the Yuuzhan Vong War.
            Skidder studied under Luke Skywalker at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, and was one of the older Knights in the class above the Solo children. In 20 ABY, with many of the senior Jedi at the wedding of Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker on Coruscant, he and Ganner Rhysode were left in charge of the Praxeum. In the early phases of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Wurth Skidder was one of Kyp Durron's protégés and supporters. Skidder's rash actions in the Osarian-Rhommamool conflict in 25 ABY helped save Leia Organa Solo from her attackers, but only fueled hostilities between the neighboring worlds.
            In the Battle of Ithor, Wurth was one of many Jedi to defend the Tafanda Bay. He fought valiantly, but suffered a severe fracture to his arm from a Yuuzhan Vong amphistaff. In the months after Ithor, Wurth found his way back to the frontlines on Gyndine. He helped New Republic troops fend off Yuuzhan Vong ground forces from inside his commandeered All Terrain Scout Transport until he had to retreat. Leia Organa Solo was on Gyndine, helping with the evacuation, when Skidder arrived. She tried to convince him to join her aboard the transports, but after promising to come back, Skidder disappeared and missed his ride. Wurth allowed himself to be captured.
            He was put aboard a yammosk carrier ship known as Crèche commanded by Commander Chine-kal. The vessel was carrying Randa the Hutt, and Wurth was put to work massaging the yammosk's tentacles. He used the Force to connect to the yammosk's mind and tried to persuade it that Randa was going to betray Chine-kal, but the yammosk saw through his lie and alerted Chine-kal of his being a Jedi. He was then "broken" by the Yuuzhan Vong after being tortured.
            Wurth later died after Jedi Master Kyp Durron and fellow Knight Ganner Rhysode tried to rescue him as they blasted their way through the ship's hull with the Dozen-and-Two Avengers and fought off many Yuuzhan Vong. Wurth knew it was too late and had them rescue the other prisoners, including Roa. By the time Kyp and Ganner reached him, Wurth Skidder was already too far gone.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wurth_Skidder</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWurthSkidder</string></dict>
        <key>Venku Skirata</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.312.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Venku Skirata, also known to family and close friends as Kad Skirata, was the Force-sensitive Human male who was the son of the clone commando, RC-1136 a.k.a Darman, and the Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan, and thus a biological “nephew” of Boba Fett and the millions of other Jango Fett clones. He was adopted by Kal Skirata as his grandson and was raised in Mandalorian culture of his genetic ancestors, and became a farmer on Mandalore, but by 40 ABY, under the name Kad'ika, or "Little Saber" in Mando'a, he was the leader of a political faction who wanted to see a resurgence of the Mandalorian people.
            Venku Skirata was born on the planet Mandalore, the son of the Jedi Etain Tur-Mukan and clone commando Darman Skirata. The child's father, Darman, did not know that Etain was pregnant, and was unaware he had a son until a year after the child's birth. Because of the Jedi rules forbidding attachment, Etain's pregnancy was kept secret, and the Jedi Council were unaware that she had a lover and a son. The child was given the name Venku by his adoptive grandfather, Kal Skirata. A few days later, however, when Omega Squad met the newborn, Darman—unaware he was Venku's father—said that he would name a son "Kad". From then on, Venku came to be referred to in private as "Kad" by members of Clan Skirata.[1]
            Kal Skirata was searching for a way to slow down the accelerated growth of his adoptive clone sons, and shortly before Kad's birth he found and captured the Kaminoan geneticist Ko Sai. Ko Sai was the geneticist responsible for the Fett genome that the clones were grown from, and refused to help Skirata, believing that he would only sell her research for credits. However, Etain bartered with Ko Sai by appealing to the Kaminoan's interest in studying Jedi blood. Etain offered Ko Sai samples of her blood and Kad's umbilical cord from which to study. Satisfied with this exchange, Ko Sai started giving out random bits of information on how to reverse the clone aging process. Shortly after Kad's birth, and before she could release all the pertinent information regarding stopping the clones' aging, Ko Sai committed suicide.[1] Ko Sai's data to stop clone aging was eventually completed, although some details remain unclear as to the how, when, where and who completed it.[5]
            During the last year of the Clone Wars, Kad was kept primarily in his aunt Laseema's apartment, with Laseema, his aunt Besany Wennen, grandfather Kal Skirata, or uncle Bardan Jusik looking after him. Etain would visit with Venku whenever she got leave from her duties as a Jedi General, and was delighted when Venku called her "Mama" during one of her visits. Later that year, Etain finally told Darman that Kad was his son. Although shocked and hurt at first because this knowledge was hidden from him, he recovered and the three of them enjoyed some family time together, with Etain even recording some family holos of the three of them. When Kad met Darman, he kept saying "Dada" over and over.[3]
            During Order 66, Etain was killed by a Jedi while she was protecting a clone trooper from a Jedi attack. Kad felt her die through the Force, screaming for five whole minutes at the moment she died, and after her death he became a more serious child who rarely smiled. Among Etain's possessions were her two lightsabers, which Skirata wanted burned alongside her, but Jusik insisted that Kad keep them. Also among her possessions were a data and comm kit, some data chips containing the family holos recorded earlier, and a small stuffed nerf toy, which Kad put on her funeral pyre. Skirata took the stuffed nerf out after it had been burned a bit, stating that he would give it back to Kad when he gets older to teach him the significance of the toy. However, the plan lasted hours, as Kad, being Force-Sensitive already knew that his mother was dead and wouldn't return.[3]
            As a result of Darman refusing to leave a wounded Niner behind, he was stranded on Coruscant and got reassigned to one of the newly formed Imperial commando units, so it fell to Skirata to raise Kad, and Bardan Jusik to further teach him how to use the Force. All the members of Clan Skirata, with the exception of Darman and Niner, defected from the Grand Army and relocated to Mandalore after Order 66, and they made their home in the town of Kyrimorut.[3]
            By the year 40 ABY, Kad had chosen to go by his birth name of Venku. Boba Fett, as ruling Mandalore, learned of the political views represented by Kad'ika from his second, Goran Beviin. Fett was curious to know if he wanted to be Mandalore himself, though both Beviin and Fett's granddaughter Mirta Gev said he wanted Fett to be the Mandalore.[4]
            Later that year, Boba Fett and Mirta came across a clone with gray leather gloves on Kuat who claimed he fought in the Clone Wars. The clone introduced himself as Jaing Skirata, and Fett asked him if he had Ko Sai's data, which Fett had been trying to track down to use on himself to cure his cloning-related ailments. Jaing said that the research was destroyed after it was used on him and his brothers, and that he no longer had a copy. Jaing stated that if he gave Fett a blood sample, he feared that Fett might sell it to the Kaminoans. However, Jaing did relent and say if Fett would give him a sample of his blood, he might be able to return with a cure. The only condition to this was that Fett would have to go back to Mandalore and follow Kad'ika's advice. Fett agreed, and Mirta took his blood sample for Jaing.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Venku_Skirata</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVenkuSkirata</string></dict>
        <key>Luke Skywalker</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.313.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Luke Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a  legendary Jedi Master who fought in the Galactic Civil War during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Along with his companions, Princess Leia Organa and Captain Han Solo, Skywalker served on the side of the Alliance to Restore the Republic—an organization committed to the downfall of Emperor Palpatine and the restoration of democracy. Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest Jedi in galactic history.
            The son of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, Luke Skywalker was born along with his twin sister Leia in 19 BBY. As a result of Amidala's death and Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force, the Skywalker children were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the royal family of Alderaan while Luke was raised by his relatives on Tatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke's own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death Star. He continued his training in the years that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor in Grand Master Yoda. After his master's death, Skywalker participated in the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, during which he confronted the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he learned was in fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke's help, Anakin returned to the light side of the Force by destroying  the Emperor at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One.
            With the Sith's destruction and the subsequent capitulation of the Empire in 5 ABY, Luke Skywalker traveled across the galaxy, searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the Jedi Order. One of his apprentices was his sister's son, Ben Solo, who inherited the Skywalker bloodline's raw strength and potential for limitless power. The loss of his nephew, who fell to the dark side like Vader before him, haunted Skywalker for the rest of his life. In addition, the destruction of his nascent Order convinced him that the time had come for the Jedi to end. He therefore sought exile on the distant world of Ahch-To, having elected to live out his remaining days as a hermit while ignoring the galaxy's pleas for help during the rise of the First Order. His solitude was interrupted in 34 ABY,  shortly after the fall of the New Republic, resulting in a chain of events that led Skywalker to play one last, momentous role in the conflict between light and darkness. Although he passed away into the Force, his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a spark of hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would not die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the Jakku scavenger known as Rey.
            During the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Yoda set out on a journey to discover the secrets of immortality. His journey took him to Moraband, the ancient Sith homeworld, where he faced visions of the future. At the end of his journey, the Force Priestess, Serenity, who guided his journey told him that there was another Skywalker, and Yoda heard his voice from the future say so as well.[16] These events alluded to the birth and destiny of Luke Skywalker, as well as his twin sister Leia.[13]
            Luke Skywalker was born in 19 BBY[2] on the asteroid of Polis Massa[4] two days after the proclamation of the Galactic Empire.[3] He and his twin sister Leia, who was born shortly after him, were the children of Galactic Republic Senator Padmé Amidala, who died shortly after labor, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who had recently fallen to the dark side of the Force. To protect the children from the Empire and Anakin, the now-Sith Lord Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi personally sent the infant Luke to live with Anakin's stepbrother Owen Lars and his wife Beru on the planet Tatooine, while Senator Bail Organa agreed to adopt Leia together with his wife, the queen of Alderaan.[4]
            Skywalker spent his youth on the Lars' moisture farm, where his uncle unsuccessfully tried to discourage his adventurous tendencies, telling him that his father had been "a navigator on a spice freighter" during the Clone Wars.[1] His aunt, Beru, would read him storybooks; one day, when his uncle had business in Mos Eisley, she took Skywalker to Anchorhead to use the HoloNet connections there and show him images of forests, rivers, and oceans.[9]
            By the age of three Luke had found pleasure playing with a model spaceship built especially for him. Luke did not know that Kenobi had actually built it and that Kenobi had been leaving several of them at his grandmother Shmi's sandblasted tombstone for his aunt to find. One morning, as Luke played with his toy, a group of marauders attacked the farm. Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had been watching Luke from afar, sprang into action, cutting down several Gamorreans before coming to the realization that he was badly outnumbered. Just as he was about to be dealt a possibly killing blow by one of the gang, Luke threw the toy starfighter he had been playing with, managing to distract the Gammorean long enough for Kenobi to separate his feet from his ankles. The battle then raged further, slowly turning in the favor of the defenders which included uncle Owen, who managed to gun down several of the invaders with a blaster. Luke cried out after noticing that one of the marauders, a Devaronian, had snuck up behind Owen, ready to knock him out. Kenobi then threw his lightsaber cutting the last marauder in half. As Luke cheered, Owen threw a punch which knocked Kenobi to the ground. Owen then ushered Luke back before chastising Kenobi for his involvement, pointing out the fact that Luke's brief show of bravery had potential ramifications for the boy's future.[17]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLukeSkywalker</string></dict>
        <key>Vult Skerris</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.314.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vult Skerris was a human male captain, and later commander, who served in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire. During the Age of the Empire, Skerris was stationed at the elite Skystrike Academy, where he trained TIE pilot cadets as a flight instructor. As a pilot, he flew a TIE/IN interceptor with red markings, a symbol of his skills in flight. Skerris wore a standard TIE pilot jumpsuit with yellow stripes on the helmet and arms. He was killed during the attack on Lothal when General Hera Syndulla lured him into a trap which disabled his TIE/D Defender Elite's shields and let her shoot him down, sending him crashing into an Arquitens-class command cruiser, destroying its magazine, and in turn sending it crashing into the bridge tower of an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer.
            Captain Vult Skerris was a TIE fighter pilot who flew a TIE interceptor during the Imperial Era. He was stationed at the elite Skystrike Academy on the planet Montross. Around 2 BBY, Skerris and two other TIE Interceptors took part in an attack on a rebel convoy heading to Teralov. Skerris and his fellow pilots wiped out the escort A-wings before strafing the rebel transport. The rebel captain pleaded for mercy and stressed that they were an unarmed transport. However, Skerris was unmoved and fired a final salvo, which hit the transport's command bridge.[3]
            Later, he took part in a simulated combat exercise at Skystrike. The exercise involved him and two cadets, Wedge Antilles and Ria Talla, flying in simulator pods. During the exercise, Skerris operated a simulated copy of the rebel freighter Ghost, which destroyed Antilles and Talla's simulated TIE fighters. Following the exercise, he took the opportunity to lecture Antilles and Talla on the merits of obeying orders. He personally addressed the two cadets and made sure that they understood his orders. Unbeknownst to Skerris and Instructor Goran, Talla was actually an undercover rebel agent named Sabine Wren–normally a crew member of the ship that had "killed" her, no less–who was on a mission to extract Antilles and two other defectors from the Academy.[3]
            When Wren, along with Antilles, Hobbie, and Rake Gahree, attempted to escape in their TIE fighters during a spaceflight exercise and board a waiting rebel CR90 corvette, Governor Arihnda Pryce activated the fighters' kill switches, detaching the solar collector panels and leaving them stranded in space. She then sent Skerris and two other TIE Interceptors to attack the rebels. Under Pryce's orders, Skerris fired on one of the cadets' TIE fighters, killing Gahree. The Imperial attack also damaged the rebel corvette, forcing the ship to jump into hyperspace.[3]
            After Wren, Antilles, and Klivian escaped the academy in a stolen TIE bomber, Skerris pursued the fugitives in his TIE Interceptor. During the pursuit, Skerris derided the cadets as young fools. While flying through Montross' atmosphere, Skerris managed to inflict damage on the TIE bomber. However, Wren and her friends were able to escape when her colleagues returned in their corvette. Taking off his flight helmet, Skerris could only watch as the rebels escaped into hyperspace with the defectors.[3]
            At some point after this incident, Skerris was promoted to commander and was chosen by Grand Admiral Thrawn to fly an experimental TIE/D Defender into the Archeon pass with two TIE Interceptors in pursuit of a rebel convoy that was carrying the former Senator Mon Mothma, who was wanted by the Empire. Skerris' TIE Defender was equipped with a deflector shield and hyperdrive. After catching up with the Ghost and its Y-wing fighter escorts, Skerris issued an ultimatum that they surrender Mothma. The rebels refused and sent the Y-wings Gold Three and Gold Four to engage the Imperial fighters. Skerris quickly destroyed them.[5]
            Skerris then followed the Ghost, carrying Mothma, and its remaining escorts into the nebula, where he gained a lock on the starship. However, the Y-wing pilot Gold Five sacrificed herself to protect the ship by flying her Y-wing into his crosshairs. After that, the rebels diverted all power to their shields and flew close to a forming star. The TIE Interceptors were swiftly destroyed due to their lack of shielding, leaving only Skerris. The Ghost sustained heavy damage but managed to escape the nebula. Skerris broke off after the radiation damaged his fighter's deflector shields.[5]
            After recovering, Skerris pursued Ezra Bridger and Gold Leader Jon Vander's Y-wings. After again finding the Y-wings, he attacked Bridger's ship. However, he again failed to destroy it and was hit with an ion blast from Vander's starfighter. Bridger had used the Force to tell Vander when to shoot. Disabled, Skerris' TIE Defender spun out of control into the nebula. However, Vander warned that they had to leave since Skerris would return once he had regained control of his fighter.[5]
            Following the Battle of Atollon, Skerris accompanied Thrawn and Sith Lord Darth Vader aboard the Chimaera. Skerris commanded Defender Squadron One during Thrawn's and Vader's journey to Batuu.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vult_Skerris</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVultSkerris</string></dict>
        <key>Cade Skywalker</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.315.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cade Skywalker was a Human male bounty hunter, smuggler, and pirate, who in his youth was once the Jedi Padawan of Wolf Sazen. The son of Jedi Master Kol Skywalker and Morrigan Corde (also known as Nyna Calixte), Cade was also a direct descendant of Luke and Anakin Skywalker and a descendant of Ben Skywalker.[5] Cade was also the nephew of Nat Skywalker (also known as "Bantha" Rawk) and his wife Droo Rawk, half-brother of Gunn Yage (though neither knew of the other's existence), cousin of Annah, and stepcousin of Skeeto, and Micah Rawk.
            Thousands of years before his birth, he appeared in Jedi Master Q'Anilia's vision, along with his ancestors, Luke Skywalker, and Anakin Skywalker, who became Darth Vader, as well as Zayne Carrick, all of whom would be affected by the Muur Talisman. After his mother left him as a baby, Cade was raised as a Jedi by his father on Ossus where he would be apprenticed to his father's former apprentice, Wolf Sazen. He spent most of his childhood where he became close to Padawan Azlyn Rae. However, at the start of the Second Imperial Civil War, Cade turned his back on his heritage after being traumatized by watching his father's death at the hands of Darth Nihl and the One Sith. After successfully reviving his master, he swore his revenge and eventually became a pirate and bounty hunter, operating from his personal starship, the Mynock with his longtime companions Jariah Syn and Deliah Blue.
            After his existence and unique Force powers were discovered by Sith Lord Darth Krayt, Cade was unwillingly pulled into galactic affairs. Caught up in the power struggle between the Sith and the exiled Emperor Fel, Cade became willing to do whatever it took to ensure he was left alone, but was eventually captured by the Sith. Following his capture, Krayt acknowledged that Cade had more power than he had ever seen in any Jedi, and offered him to join him and the Sith. Refusing his offer, Cade was forced to watch his friends die when Darth Maladi planted Yuuzhan Vong Yorik-Kul coral seeds. Cade had no option but to help both of his friends by using his anger to cure them at a great cost. With the dark side corrupting him, Cade was surprised that Krayt showed him his father's lightsaber and revealed his former identity as Jedi Master A'Sharad Hett. Skywalker was able to escape when he injured Nihl and Talon.
            After being briefly captured by the Sith, Cade was reunited with his uncle and his childhood sweetheart, Azlyn Rae, who secretly became an Imperial Knight. After arriving to the secret Hidden Temple on Taivas, and been followed by several Imperial Knights, Cade was angered by Azlyn's betrayal until he had met with the new Jedi Council members, K'Kruhk, Tili Qua and T'ra Saa. Together, they participated in a successful mission that saw the death of Darth Krayt. However, Krayt's traitorous advisor conspired to keep this fact a secret and appointed himself Regent over Krayt's Empire. After saving Azlyn's life, against her wishes, Cade and Azlyn's relationship fell apart. Angered by the destruction his actions continually caused, Cade left for Tatooine, where he began raiding Black Sun shipments. These events drew the attention of both his mother and his half-sister Gunn Yage.
            After leaving Tatooine, Cade and his crew accepted a recovery mission on Wayland, site of the failed Ossus Project. There, Cade encountered Darth Maladi, who was seeking to perfect a new Sith bioweapon. Cade attempted to heal Blue, who had been captured and implanted with the weapon, but to no avail. Wolf Sazen tracked Cade to Wayland and convinced him to use the light-side of the Force to heal Blue, which was successful. As a result of these events, Cade finally rejected the dark-side but resolved to not rejoin the Jedi Order, believing the Force shaped him for a different destiny, to destroy the One Sith.
            Cade set off on a quest for vengeance, accompanied by his friends. On Utapau, Skywalker killed Sith scientist Vul Isen and learned of Krayt's return from the dead. He would encounter his mother once more on the Wheel, where under the council of his father, forgave her and healed her from certain death. Shortly thereafter, Skywalker returned to the Jedi Hidden Temple on Taivas to defend against the incoming attack there. The battle was a disaster for the Jedi and its allied forces, and Nat Skywalker sacrificed his life to save that of his nephew. Distraught by his uncle's death, Cade led an elite strike team to shut down Coruscant's planetary defenses in the final battle of the war. Cade lost his former master in the fight, but succeeded in resisting temptation and as a Jedi, killed Krayt once and for all. To ensure the Dark Lord of the Sith would never return, Cade took his mother's ship to the planet's sun, where he intended to incinerate both himself and Krayt's body. However, under the guidance of Luke Skywalker, Cade escaped the doomed ship, and was rescued by Syn, R2-D2, and his lover, Deliah Blue. With the war over, Cade Skywalker set out for a distant place where the group could be in peace.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cade_Skywalker</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCadeSkywalker</string></dict>
        <key>Ben Skywalker</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.316.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ben Skywalker was a Human male Jedi Knight from Coruscant, active mostly during the Second Galactic Civil War and the period afterward. He was the son of former Emperor's Hand and Jedi Master Mara Jade Skywalker and legendary Rebel hero and Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, the grandson of the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker, and Padmé Amidala, the cousin of Jacen, Jaina and Anakin Solo, and the ancestor of Cade, Kol and Nat Skywalker. Ben was born amidst the turmoil of the devastating Yuuzhan Vong War, where an extra-galactic species known as the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, laying waste to dozens of worlds. As both of his parents were Jedi, they were unable to spend time with him as they fought in the war, so Skywalker was taken care of by his aunt and uncle, former Rebel heroes Han and Leia Solo. He was subsequently moved to the Shelter in the Maw, where many other young Jedi apprentices stayed. The Yuuzhan Vong were eventually repelled and a ceasefire was negotiated, but young Skywalker felt the pain of war through the Force, overwhelming him and causing him to close himself off from the Force for several years.
            In 35 ABY, Skywalker, now eight years old, became involved in another galactic crisis. The Killik species had recently been discovered in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, when a group of Jedi Knights heard their telepathic call and followed it to the Unknown Regions. Skywalker became partially joined to the Gorog Killik nest and formed an owner-pet relationship with one of the Gorog Killiks, who was actually trying to turn him against his mother. However, Ben's parents discovered the Killik's plan and captured it. During this time, Skywalker was taken under the wing of his cousin Jacen Solo, who became his informal Jedi Master. Solo, who had just returned to the New Jedi Order after a five-year journey to learn more about the Force, was able to help Skywalker open himself up to the Force gradually, as Skywalker was still apprehensive about the Force and needed years to become fully adjusted to the Force. With Solo's guidance, Skywalker was able to grow confident in his usage of the Force and become a powerful Jedi.
            Five years later, the planet of Corellia and the other planets in the Corellian system seceded from the Galactic Alliance, sparking great civil unrest, terrorist attacks, and eventually, the Second Galactic Civil War. During this time, Skywalker joined the Galactic Alliance Guard, a secret police force designed to combat Corellian terrorism, which was led by Jacen Solo. The GAG controversially began interning Corellians on Coruscant, an action which greatly worried his parents. Skywalker was increasingly used on violent missions, including the assassination of Corellian politician Dur Gejjen. Meanwhile, Jacen Solo had fallen to the dark side of the Force under the tutelage of Sith Lady Lumiya, taking the Sith name Darth Caedus. Caedus eventually took over the Galactic Alliance before killing Mara Jade Skywalker. Skywalker correctly believed that Caedus was the killer and attempted to kill Caedus several times, including in a heated battle over Kashyyyk. He decided to legitimately investigate with his friend in the GAG, Lon Shevu, and was able to prove that Caedus had murdered his mother. Eventually Caedus himself was eliminated in a lightsaber duel, and the Second Galactic Civil War ended.
            In 43 ABY, Luke Skywalker was exiled from Coruscant by new Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala for failing to prevent Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side, until he could prove the causes of Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side. By that time, anti-Jedi sentiment had risen greatly, especially due to an unexplained madness among young Jedi. Skywalker accompanied his father into exile, where the two visited several Force-based organizations with whom Solo had studied during his five-year sojourn—first the Baran Do, where they discovered a secret sect of monks known as the Hidden Ones, then the secretive Aing-Tii, and then the Mind Walkers in a mysterious space station known as Sinkhole Station. While at the station, the two were attacked by a group of Sith, but the two were able to escape. However, Ben and his father continued to cross paths with the Sith, and after a heated encounter on Dathomir, Ben and his father formed an unprecedented alliance with the Sith in order to defeat Abeloth, the supernatural being who was spreading insanity among the Jedi, and allegedly among young Sith apprentices as well. During this alliance, Ben formed a close relationship with the young Sith apprentice Vestara Khai. Eventually, the Sith betrayed their Jedi allies, though Ben and Luke were able to escape and defeat Abeloth, ending the psychosis. Subsequently, Ben and Luke stayed behind with a few Sith to learn more about Abeloth's origins. After further exploration of Abeloth's planet, Ben, Luke, and Vestara faced off against Abeloth and the Sith once again on Pydyr, severing the alliance as the Skywalkers and Vestara continued their hunt for Abeloth. To Luke's dismay, Ben and Vestara's bond continued to grow despite Vestara's multiple betrayals, eventually evolving into a romantic relationship after Vestara was forced to kill her father and turned to the light side.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ben_Skywalker</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBenSkywalker</string></dict>

In the months prior to the Battle of Yavin, he was Zarien Kheev's main henchman on a hijacked research vessel situated on the planet Alderaan.
            While there, he was tasked with performing experiments on a new drug, using captured research scientists as the subjects. The drug was meant to increase workers performance on Mustafar, where the Empire was using workers to mine mirkanite, a material used in the construction of turbolasers—and obviously intended for use aboard the Death Star. When Rianna Saren, a mercenary hired by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, infiltrated the research ship and destroyed the drug, Sagar ordered his men to shut down the operation and promised Zarien Kheev to find the intruders. He battled Rianna Saren on a landing platform and was killed by her. Before she left, Rianna stole his heavy blaster pistol to use as her own.

Scabrous sought to extend his life indefinitely, and so attempted to create an ancient Sith formula devised by Darth Drear that would grant him immortality using the Murakami orchid. The formula also resulted in the partial resurrection of those who had already died, but turned them into cannibalistic monstrosities. Scarbrous commanded hordes of these creatures during his lifetime.[1] It was rumored that Darth Scabrous granted secret training sessions to Sith Acolyte Rance Lussk, during which he taught Lussk techniques in mind control.
            Scabrous planned on using the orchid's caretaker, Hestizo Trace, in a sacrificial ritual in which he would cut out her heart and eat it, allowing the high midi-chlorian count in it to stabilize the formula and truly render himself immortal. However, Hestizo managed to escape and with the sacrifice of her brother Rojo, she managed to kill Scabrous.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Scabrous</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthScabrous</string></dict>
        <key>Skavak</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.319.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Skavak, indirectly nicknamed the Jackal of the Stars, was a male Human who was the most infamous criminal during the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire.
            Skavak was famous for being a thief, scoundrel, and traitor. He was a rogue and assassin. Even in the galactic underworld, Skavak usually betrayed his associates if he thought it was more convenient for him. In c. 3643 BBY, Jet Nebula sold information to him about the fastbreeder. Skavak’s sole loyalty was to himself, and he would take jobs from anyone if it would line his pockets with a few more credits. Brash, arrogant and utterly without remorse, Skavak was long overdue for a takedown.
            Skavak's long overdue downfall came during the hunt for the lost treasure of Nok Drayen. While on Ord Mantell, he and Corso Riggs worked for a boss named Viidu when they were battling the Separatists. He immediately betrayed Corso and stole a ship from a smuggler and tried to use it as his base for the search. However, the smuggler tracked Skavak down to Coruscant, where Skavak sold Imperial agents a counterfeit gem and took the ship back, but Skavak had already sold all the guns meant for Rogun the Butcher. In the process, the smuggler won over Skavak's partner Risha Drayen and disgraced Skavak in the eyes of the galaxy. Skavak was furious that the smuggler got the better of him, and swore to kill his new nemesis.
            Skavak hired mercenaries to pursue the smuggler on Taris, who was seeking a radiation vault containing astrogation charts necessary to finding the treasure. The mercenaries got there first and contacted Skavak when confronted by the smuggler. Skavak ordered his men to attack but they were all killed by the smuggler, who departed the planet with the charts.
            Skavak was later contacted by an ex-flame, Feylara Raed, whom he financially exploited in the past, having heard of the smuggler's embellishing against him and lured his nemesis to her ship, the Celestial Crow, so she could kill them on her behalf. Feylara activated her droids to attack the smuggler but they were swiftly destroyed. Feylara nervously pleaded for them to part way. Skavak then signed off upon confirming that she was using finite batteries to power her ray shield.
            On Alderaan, Skavak personally interfered with his nemesis' attempts to trade the head of Darth Bandon for an Arkanian hyperdrive for House Alde, coercing a museum assistant, Neva, into falsifying the authentication of the fake head he provided. When the smuggler presented the authentic head, Peema Ahuff contacted Skavak, who gloated about his victory. The smuggler raced to the House Organa spaceport but Skavak's ship had already lifted off and headed for the House Thul spaceport to install the hyperdrive. The con artist watched via hologram for his Alderaanian contract mercenaries to kill the smuggler but they too failed. With Risha's aid in blackmailing a baron, the smuggler managed to infiltrate the Thul spaceport. The smuggler then reclaimed the hyperdrive and freed Vonddado Briimyo, the Neimoidian mechanic Skavak had under duress. Skavak later called Risha and the smuggler on their ship, promising vengeance, despite being at a disadvantage.
            Eventually, Skavak stowed away on the smuggler's ship during the final part of the search, and confronted his rival after the treasure was found. He attempted to kill the smuggler, but was killed in-turn.
            Skavak's legacy took the form of numerous maps and floor plans that supposedly originated from the lost world of Ossus; copies of the plans and maps survived and were still circulating through the black market over three thousand years later.
            Skavak was first mentioned in the novel The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance by the name "Shavak," referenced by Jet Nebula.
            He first appeared in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, produced by BioWare in 2011. Skavak is voiced by Kiff VandenHeuvel, who also voices Jordel Tlan in TOR, and Zachary Hale Comstock in BioShock Infinite. He is the main antagonist in Chapter One of the Smuggler storyline, and can be romanced if the player is female.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Skavak</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSkavak</string></dict>

        <key>Syo Bakarn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.322.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Syo Bakarn was a Human male Corellian Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a healer during the Great Galactic War against the resurgent Sith Empire. Following the Treaty of Coruscant, Master Bakarn relocated to Tython where he served as a member of the Jedi High Council during the Cold War. However, Bakarn himself was unaware that he was host to a second personality, the First Son of the Sith Emperor.
            Syo Bakarn was a Force-sensitive Human male[3] native of the Core World of Corellia.[1] Born around 3678 BBY,[2] he was a member of the Bakarn family,[1] which had once carried the name Bakvalen. The Bakvalens had at one point been a well-known Corellian noble lineage, living in Bakvalen Hall, their own manor in the capital city of Coronet.[7] Bakarn was born during a time of turmoil, as the Galactic Republic was engaged in the Great Galactic War with the resurgent Sith Empire, led by the enigmatic Sith Emperor. Seeking to further his power base, the Sith Emperor decided to create a group of personal sleeper agents called "Children of the Emperor." The Emperor's agents, Servants of the clandestine organization Emperor's Hand, scoured the galaxy for Force-sensitive beings suited for their Master's needs. Like many infants from many different species, Bakarn was spirited away from his family on Corellia[8] and he was taken to the Sith Academy on the planet Korriban to undergo training in a specialized group.[9] For weeks, Bakarn and the other children underwent various rituals and processes inside the Academy,[10] until eventually Bakarn was chosen to be the first individual to be inducted into the ranks of the Children of the Emperor.[8] The young Bakarn was granted a personal audience with the Sith Emperor, whereupon he was infused with the Emperor's strength and was bound to his mind and will, becoming the Emperor's First Son.[4] The First Son was essentially another persona created inside Bakarn's mind, who was unaware of its existence. A master strategist, the First Son would lay dormant inside the labyrinths of Bakarn's mind, waiting for the Emperor's command to awaken and do his Master's bidding.[8]
            After his initiation, Bakarn was returned by the Emperor's Hand to his parents, as eventually were the other Children. Thus, a network of sleeper agents was spread by the Sith Emperor throughout both the Republic and his own Sith Empire.[8] The First Son, bound through the Force to the other Children, continued to sleep inside Bakarn. However, he constantly projected a mental shield, hiding himself and the other Children of the Emperor from being detected by other Force-sensitives.[11] As long as the First Son lived, the Children were undetectable by the galaxy at large. Having no memories of his experiences at the Sith Academy and unaware of the second personality inside him,[8] Bakarn continued to live with his parents on Corellia. He and his father at one point took a walk in Axial Park, when his father told him about their family's proud past.[1] Eventually, Bakarn's Force-sensitivity was discovered by the Jedi Order. He was taken from his homeworld and trained in the ways of the Force, becoming a Padawan to a Jedi Master. During his time as a Padawan, Bakarn gained recognition after he saved his Master from an attack by a Mandalorian Jedi hunter. Eventually attaining the rank of Jedi Knight and studying as a Consular, Bakarn focused his studies on his healing skills, eventually becoming a noted healer.[6]
            As a Jedi Knight, Bakarn joined the war effort and fought on the front lines of the Great Galactic War. Although he displayed great combat prowess on the battlefields, Bakarn found no enjoyment in fighting and preferred to channel his talents on healing and rebuilding. As such, Bakarn made it his priority to tend to wounded Republic soldiers after each battle.[8] At one point in his life, he distributed ancient medicine across the alleways of his native Coronet City. Such actions earned him the nicknames "the Wise Son of Corellia"[12] and "the Quiet Healer."[8] Near the end of the war, around 3653 BBY, Bakarn joined fellow Knights Satele Shan, Bela Kiwiiks and Jaric Kaedan during the battle on the icy Outer Rim world of Rhen Var. Rhen Var had been captured earlier by the Dark Council member and Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Mekhis, a Sith scientist and alchemist, who intended to use the world to test her new creations. The Jedi and the Republic army landed on the surface of Rhen Var and embarked on a march toward Darth Mekhis's fortress. The Republic's Forty-fifth Battalion was dispatched ahead to the forests of Rhen Var as a scout force for the Jedi and the main army, but while on the scouting mission, they were attacked by the Empire's weaponized poison gas. By the time, the rest of the Republic forces reached them, all of the scouts were either killed or close to dying. True to his duties as a Jedi healer, Bakarn attempted to ease the suffering of the dying scout Maxin Davers, while Shan rallied Republic forces for a final push forward toward Darth Mekhis's fortress. Bakarn and the Republic army soon encountered and engeged a large detachment of the Empire's troops and Sith but were able to defeat them. As the Republic laid siege to Mekhis's fortress, Shan personally infiltrated the compound and captured the Sith, ending the battle in a Republic victory.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Syo_Bakarn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSyoBakarn</string></dict>

        <key>Raith Sienar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.326.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Raith Sienar was a prominent engineer during the closing years of the Galactic Republic and early days of the Galactic Empire, producing countless highly advanced designs, most well-known among them the TIE fighter; he was also the originator of the concept for the Death Star. Ambitious and keen, Sienar was raised inside the Sienar family, which had run the prominent shipbuilding concern Santhe/Sienar Technologies for thousands of years. Sienar struck off to prove himself as a teen before returning to the fold, where his father Narro Sienar trained him to take over the company. When Narro was killed by assassins seeking Raith, the younger Sienar, only in his twenties, took over the company. For the next decade, Sienar lived an aristocratic lifestyle, designing unique and cutting-edge ships on Coruscant for wealthy and secretive clients. He was purported to have been the designer even of the Scimitar for Darth Plagueis (alias Hego Damask), which afterwards was gifted to Darth Sidious' apprentice Darth Maul, but this was later refuted by Sienar himself (for he was its builder only): the sleek Sith Infiltrator was actually the design of Plagueis' Master, Darth Tenebrous (alias Rugess Nome, a famous starship designer in his own right).[6]
            In 29 BBY, Sienar's friend Wilhuff Tarkin recruited him into a scheme to take control of Zonama Sekot, a world producing advanced living ships. Sienar already knew of the world and had plans of his own, but acquiesced to Tarkin's demands. Sienar was given command of a squadron of ships and sent after Sekot, but Tarkin had designed the mission to fail, and swept in expecting to save the day with his own force. The Sekotans defeated them, however, and fled; Zonama Sekot was equipped with enormous hyperdrive engines that allowed it to jump to hyperspace. Tarkin was only able to save himself from disgrace by presenting Palpatine with Sienar's plans for an Expeditionary Battle Planetoid; Sienar had lost interest in the design, but it would form the basis of the Death Star years later. Sienar continued developing ships, and when Palpatine declared himself Galactic Emperor, he placed Sienar in command of a new company, Sienar Fleet Systems, where Sienar designed the iconic TIE fighter and became one of the new Empire's primary arms providers, a role he held until he was cut down by assassins financed by corporate rivals.
            Around 60 BBY, Raith Sienar was born to Narro Sienar, the Chief Executive Officer of the massive engineering firm Santhe/Sienar Technologies, and his wife. Sienar was raised among the wealthy and secretive Sienar clan, which had a history of starship design stretching back thousands of years.[2] Sienar attended the Rigovian Technical University[1] and the young man's mind quickly turned to engineering, developing an outlook that saw life as a series of engineering puzzles.[2] He grew to be highly competitive, but eventually channeled that competitive streak into only those areas suited to his talents, competing only where he knew he could win.[1] Quick to learn and with an overriding desire for intellectual stimulation, Sienar grew restless within the upper-class confines of his family, seeking to distinguish himself and be unpredictable and innovative. In his teens, he struck off on his own to make his mark independently.[2]
            Sienar took his own personal funds and created his own scouting firm. The youth took to the star lanes, mapping new hyperspace routes and probing the Unknown Regions to find habitable and exploitable worlds. Some of his discoveries, such as one uncharted black hole that he found, Sienar kept to himself, seeing a possible future advantage in such personal knowledge. Others, he shared and sold, turning a tidy profit and becoming independently wealthy by the age of twenty. He had built a personal fortune without the aid of his family and untouchable by them.[2]
            Feeling that he had proved his own independent worth, Sienar returned to his family at age twenty, where Narro was impressed by his son's accomplishments.[2][7] The Sienar patriarch began to groom Raith as his successor in the prestigious family business; Raith, as usual, felt the need to gain experience his own way. He wanted a broader knowledge of starship construction than that of simply his own family firm, and he wanted to make sure he would be ready for the pressures of upper management.[2]
            To that end, Sienar assumed a series of false identities and took work with competing firms, moving through the management of the Corellian Engineering Corporation, Baktoid Armor Workshop, Incom Corporation, and even the Trade Federation. There, he gained firsthand experience undercover, without the distraction of his family name, and picked up various techniques from his competitors. Sienar also spent time among the Xi Char, for whom precision engineering was a religion. Sienar studied their techniques deeply, seeking to master the engineering craft. Sienar picked up several advanced techniques, but eventually his true motives were exposed, and the Xi Char, feeling betrayed and sullied by the presence of a nonbeliever in their sacred workshops, turned against the faithless spy in their ranks. They exiled Sienar from Charros IV and then hired four bounty hunters to take Sienar's life. Sienar eluded them, leading them through a hyperspace chase until he emerged near an unrecorded black hole that he had discovered—but never reported—in his exploring days.[2][8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Raith_Sienar/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRaithSienar</string></dict>

        <key>Nevil Cygni</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.330.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nevil Cygni, also known by his alias Nightswan, was a male human smuggler and insurgent leader during the Imperial Era. Before becoming an insurgent leader, Cygni acted as a consultant to Angel's pirate group Culoss, which he used to raise funds for avenging people who had been wronged by the Empire. While raiding the freighter Dromedar, Cygni came into contact with the Chiss Thrawn, a rising star in the Imperial Navy who would later rise to the rank of Grand Admiral. After Thrawn disrupted Culoss' operations, Cygni used the Higher Skies Advocacy Group as a front group to gather intelligence on Imperial officials and senators on Coruscant with the goal of uncovering the Galactic Empire's secret Death Star project. This operation was disrupted by Arihnda Pryce, the future Governor of Lothal, with the help of Thrawn and the Imperial Security Bureau.
            Cygni later engineered the Imperial annexation of Umbara, which was defeated by Thrawn. After the Umbara incident, Cygni instigated the Cyphar Incident between the native Cyphari Afe clan and human colonists as a means of smuggling doonium from Cyphar offworld. This was again defeated by Commander Thrawn, who discovered that the human colonists were also exporting an illegal spice called scarn. Soon after the operation, Cygni advised a group of insurgents to rescue Wookiee slaves from the transport Sempre, and launched an attack on the space station Lansend Twenty-Six to liberate their companions. Thrawn again foiled the attack, gaining Nightswan's respect.
            Cygni later became the leader of the Batonn insurgents and engineered the Battle of Scrim Island to facilitate his showdown with Thrawn. Despite Nightswan's cunning tactics, Thrawn recaptured Scrim Island for the Empire. After Thrawn's aide-de-camp Eli Vanto ascertain that Cygni and Nightswan were indeed the same person, Thrawn met with Cygni to negotiate a peaceful dispute to the siege of the Creekpath Mining and Refining complex on Batonn's main continent. Despite failing to end the siege, Cygni extracted a promise from Thrawn to minimize civilian casualties. Thrawn's efforts came to naught when Governor Pryce blew up the Creekpath complex to hide the murder of ISB Agent Gudry. Cygni was killed during the explosion, which ended the Batonn sector insurgency.
            During the Imperial Era, Nevil Cygni worked at the Kanauer Corporation's mining operations in the Thrugii asteroid belt. He later joined a splinter group which had broken away from the Mining Guild in order to manipulate the rising confusion in the Empire's metal markets for their own gain. This chaos in metal prices was hurting many small businesses including shipbuilders. Cygni had joined the group with the hope of siphoning off enough from the Imperial Navy's demands in order to help them out. However, Cygni left in disgust after learning that the splinter group was selling the stolen metals back to the Galactic Empire through the black market.[1]
            After leaving the splinter group, Cygni helped ordinary citizens who had been hurt by the Empire and could not get any redress. To conceal his true identity, Cygni adopted the code name "Nightswan" after a bird. To raise funds for these activities, Cygni stole and smuggled metals like doonium and tibanna gas. This line of work brought him into contact with Angel's pirate group Culoss, who were descended from Q'anah's Marauders. In addition, Cygni worked with the occasional insurgents including a group that had instigated the Circle Bay mayor's office protest on the planet Nubia. Nightswan's activities drew the attention of the Imperial Security Bureau Colonel Wullf Yularen, a senior Imperial officia.[1]
            Cygni also toyed with going back to the Mining Guild but decided to cast his lot with the insurgents after the Mining Guild reported the splinter group he had been working with to the Imperial authorities. While engaging in smuggling and "consultancy", Cygni heard rumors that the Empire was running a secret project that consumed vast amounts of doonium, iridium, and other minerals. He also heard that entire planets were being strip-mined. In addition, the Empire took over the Thrugii asteroid mines. This secret project turned out to be the Death Star superweapon. In response, Nightswan used Driller MarDapp's Higher Skies Advocacy Group to gather intelligence on Imperial officials and senators in the galactic capital Coruscant using bodyguards, who were trained by Juahir Madras, a martial arts instructor at the Yinchom Dojo.[1]
            While working with the Culoss pirates, Cygni infiltrated the freighter Dromedar by posing as a new crew member. Later, his pirate associates raided the Dromedar, which was carrying valuable tibanna gas. Cygni and the Culoss pirates managed to capture the crew and lock them in a makeshift brig at the rear of the ship. The Dromedar's distress transmission was picked up by the Gozanti-class cruiser Blood Crow. Serving aboard the ship were Senior Lieutenant Thrawn and his friend Ensign Eli Vanto, who had graduated from the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant 18 months earlier. With the approval of Captain Filia Rossi, Thrawn led a boarding party consisting of the Imperial Ensigns Vanto and Merri Barlin, and the technicians Jakeeb and Layneo.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nevil_Cygni</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNevilCygni</string></dict>

            Nik Sant served the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War,[1] and by 4 ABY[2] he was one of the most veteran scouts in the Alliance Military.[3] That year, the Rebel Alliance launched a decisive attack against the Galactic Empire during the Battle of Endor, where they intended to destroy the Empire's second Death Star superweapon.[1] Sant, one of the Pathfinders,[4] was part of a strike team led by General Han Solo that was tasked with destroying the shield generator that powered the Death Star's shield. Their operation was a success, allowing Alliance forces to destroy the orbiting Death Star and fracture the Empire.[1]
            Nik Sant was, by 4 ABY,[2] an older male human with light skin, white hair, and a white beard. During the Battle of Endor, he wore the typical military uniform worn by members of the Pathfinders.[1]
            Nik Sant appeared briefly as a member of Han Solo's strike team in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.[1] He was first identified as Nik Sant in The Official Star Wars Fact File 44 in 2002.[5]
            The similarities between Sant's white beard and the beard of Clone Captain Rex, stoked speculation that Sant and Rex could be the same character. In 2016, at a screening of the second season finale of Star Wars Rebels, executive producer Dave Filoni speculated that the "bearded old guy on Endor," Nik Sant, could be Rex, suggesting it did not make any sense for there to be an "old guy" on Endor unless it was someone like Rex.[6] The Rebels series finale, which aired on March 5, 2018, confirmed that Rex did fight at the Battle of Endor, but did not go so far as to confirm that Rex and Sant are the same character.[7] Six months after the episode's airing, Filoni revealed in an interview with IGN he ultimately choose to not canonize the theory because he felt that laying down an already established character prior to his coming to Star Wars wasn't correct, adding that Rex could have been present at Endor and not be Sant, even though some fans could choose to believe that Sant and Rex are the same individual while other choose to not do so.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nik_Sant</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNikSant</string></dict>
        <key>Zev Senesca</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.334.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zev Senesca was a Human male starfighter pilot who served with Rogue Squadron in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. In 3 ABY, he flew as Rogue Two during the Battle of Hoth. However, he was killed when his T-47 snowspeeder was shot down by an Imperial AT-AT.
            Zev Senesca was born and raised on Kestic Station, a trading outpost on the fringes of the Bestine system. A stopover point for free-traders with no affiliations, especially ties to the Galactic Empire, Senesca became familiar and skilled in the life of a trader and pilot. His parents were persons of high ideals. They were known for trading in virtually any kind of good and, in their later years, began running arms for the fledgling Rebel Alliance. Although supplying the Rebellion was illegal and punishable by death, they felt they were doing the right thing and sought to instill this same kind of morality in their son. Growing up in such a free environment and surrounded by people with such strong ethical values, Senesca was a perfect candidate for recruitment by the Rebellion. His parents encouraged him to leave Kestic and take up arms with the Rebellion, which he soon did.[3]
            Under his parents, Kestic soon became a vital link in the Alliance's supply chain. However, Rebel supply lines were traced back to the station. The Star Destroyer Merciless, on a tip from an informant, arrived and, without stopping to take prisoners or ask questions, destroyed the station. All aboard were killed, including Senesca's parents. His response to this tragedy was not grief, but anger. He blamed the Alliance for the destruction of Kestic Station, and for the death of his parents. And so, after no more than a year of fighting for the Rebellion, he left the Alliance and headed for deep space and a life as a free-trader.[3]
            It was not long until Senesca learned the shocking truth about what happened. A "friend" he had confided in concerning Kestic's Rebel involvement was the informant who revealed the station's ties to the Empire. He had trusted this "friend," and the leak in security of the supply line was Senesca's fault. This realization gave him a newfound attitude toward the Rebellion, and he came to accept his own responsibility. It was not long after this that Zev rejoined the Alliance to fight the true enemy—the Empire.[3][4]
            Senesca's second stint with the Rebellion saw him become known as a worthy starfighter pilot. During the evacuation of the Rebel base at Alis Point, Senesca single-handedly held off three TIE/LN starfighters, while an unarmed transport fled into hyperspace, an action that helped earn the pilot a place in Commander Narra's newly formed Rogue Squadron.[3]
            As a member of the nascent Rogue Squadron, Senesca flew under the call sign Rogue Two. He was the oldest member of the squadron throughout his service with them, and stayed pretty much to himself. Six months after the Battle of Yavin in 1 ABY, he fought with the Rogues in the campaign against Moff Kohl Seerdon, including the raid of Imperial tibanna gas facilities above Taloraan; the destruction of the Weapons Research Facility on Fest; the Battle of Chandrila; the Rogues' raid on Sullust; and the protection of bacta facilities on the planet Thyferra, in which Seerdon was finally killed.[4]
            Seven months after Yavin, Senesca, alongside Wedge Antilles, helped defend grounded members of the squadron from TIE fighters on an uncharted world. Due in part to Senesca's actions, Luke Skywalker and Narra escaped the planet with their lives, and in the company of the clone trooper Able.[5]
            Along with the rest of Rogue Squadron, Senesca was assigned to the newly formed Echo Base on the planet Hoth in 2 ABY to protect the Alliance High Command. When Skywalker failed to return from a routine scouting mission in 3 ABY, Han Solo went out to locate his missing friend. Neither returned before nightfall, when the base's shield doors had to be closed to protect the base from the planet's brutal icy winds. At daybreak, Senesca led the T-47 airspeeder patrol sent out to locate them. He successfully found Skywalker and Solo stranded amid the snow, having survived an overnight blizzard.[2]
            When the Empire discovered the Rebel base and launched a massive ground assault soon thereafter, Senesca once again manned his airspeeder and flew with Rogue Squadron to hold off the invasion in order for the base's troop transports to evacuate. He managed to maintain control of his craft through most of the battle despite being hit by several laser barrages by the horde of AT-AT walkers. Late in the battle, he formed up with Skywalker on an approach of the Imperial line, ordered to try and bring down one of the walkers with the speeder's harpoon and tow cable, a trick that Antilles had successfully employed to bring down one of the walkers earlier. As his gunner, Kit Valent, prepared his tow cable, Senesca, Skywalker, and Derek "Hobbie" Klivian approached, his speeder suffered several direct hits from multiple walkers and he was killed along with his gunner.[2][6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zev_Senesca/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZevSenesca</string></dict>
        <key>Erskin Semaj</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.335.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Erskin Semaj was a human male commander who served as an aide to Senator Mon Mothma in the rebellion and later served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He and members of Gold Squadron encountered Hera Syndulla's Spectres' rebel cell the Phoenix Squadron during a mission to escort Mon Mothma to Dantooine to rally the rebel fleet.
            Erskin Semaj served as Senator Mon Mothma's senatorial attache during the Age of the Empire. In 2 BBY, Senator Mon Mothma denounced the Galactic Empire's role in the Ghorman Massacre and resigned from the Imperial Senate. Erskin and members of Gold Squadron accompanied Mon Mothma into hiding[1] on her Taylander shuttle Chandrila Mistress [3]and several Y-wing escorts. With Mon Mothma and her fellow rebels now fugitives, her friend Senator Bail Organa arranged for the group to rendezvous with Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla and her Spectres in deep space in order to refuel their ships.[1]
            After Mothma's freighter docked with Hera's VCX-100 light freighter Ghost, Semaj and Gold Leader Captain Jon Vander boarded the rebel ship. The two met Hera and her crew Garazeb Orrelios, Ezra Bridger, and the astromech droid Chopper. When Ezra asked what cargo they were carrying, Erskin told them they were not allowed aboard due to security conditions. Hera responded by telling them they were welcome aboard her ship. The Ghost then began refueling Mothma's freighter's Y-wing escorts.[1]
            While they were refueling, an argument broke out between the pilot Gold Two and the Spectres over secrecy and tactics. When Hera defended her crew, Semaj took a conciliatory stance and remarked that the tactical infiltration pod that the Spectres had encountered earlier was probably looking for them. After an Arquitens-class command cruiser and a Gozanti-class cruiser exited hyperspace and damaged Mothma's ship, Semaj, Mothma, and the remaining crew fled aboard the Ghost. Together with the Y-wing escorts, the rebels then fled to the Archeon Nebula.[1]
            Following their escape, Semaj advised the former Senator Mothma to abandon their mission and return to a safe hiding place on Chandrila. Mothma disagreed and said that she would not hide because her presence at the meeting on Dantooine was not optional. Mothma then briefed the rebels about her plan to convene a meeting of the different rebel factions on Dantooine in order to form a Rebel Alliance. After escaping an Imperial trap in the Archeon Nebula, Semaj and his fellow rebels managed to reach Dantooine where Mon Mothma delivered a speech to the assembled rebel fleet.[1]
            After the Spectres arrived on Yavin 4 aboard the Ghost, Erskin Semaj informed the Spectres that Mon Mothma had requested a meeting with them to discuss intelligence from the Lothal resistance leader Ryder Azadi that the Empire was testing a new kind of TIE/D Defender. The Spectres accepted the mission and infiltrated Lothal with the help of the crime lord Cikatro Vizago.[2] Hera Syndulla managed to steal the prototype starfighter's flight data recorder and returned to Yavin 4 aboard Ryder's U-wing. Erskin and Mothma greeted Syndulla and were both pleased to see the flight recorder.[4]
            Later, Erskin attended a high-level rebel briefing with Mon Mothma, Senator Organa, General Dodonna, and Syndulla to discuss the threat posed by the TIE/D Defender Elite to the Alliance's starfighters. After the Empire launched Protocol 13, Hera convinced Mon Mothma to authorize a strike mission to take out the Imperial factories on Lothal.[5]
            Erskin Semaj was a human male with brown eyes. A senatorial attaché, he wore a blue and white uniform patterned similarly to Rebel SpecForce Pathfinders stationed on Yavin at the time.[1] Semaj was a loyal and protective servant of the rebel leader Mon Mothma. While he sometimes regarded her as too daring, he was a reliable aid and shared her beliefs in fighting for the galaxy's freedom.[6] Semaj could also be brusque towards strangers. His pragmatism clashed with Mothma's idealism.[1]
            Erskin Semaj first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels Season Three episode "Secret Cargo", which first premiered on Disney XD on March 4, 2017. He was voiced by Josh Brener.

        <key>Taidu Sefla</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.336.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Taidu Sefla was a human male soldier who served as a lieutenant in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the early days of conflict against the Galactic Empire. In 0 BBY, Sefla was involved in Operation Fracture, the Rebel Alliance's effort to obtain intelligence on the Empire's newest superweapon, the Death Star. When a mission to obtain the Death Star's schematics was not officially sanctioned by the Alliance High Command, Sefla joined a volunteer group known as Rogue One, who disobeyed orders and departed to the planet Scarif in order to obtain the plans from the Imperial security complex located there.
            During the mission, Sefla field-promoted Jyn Erso, a civilian who was in charge of the mission, to the rank of sergeant, so as to increase her credibility in the eyes of other rebels. Sefla was later a member of a distraction team that drew away Imperial forces from Erso and Captain Cassian Andor, while they were occupied with extracting the plans from the security complex's data vault. Sefla survived the grueling battle to the very late stages, but he was ultimately killed by Imperial death troopers while attempting to establish a communications link to the Rebel fleet in orbit of Scarif.
            Taidu Sefla was a human male member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic's Special Forces during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire.[3] At one point during his service, Sefla made additions to a document titled "Readiness Report: Surface Vehicles," which had been compiled by SpecForce General Pitt Onoran and focused on assessing relative strengths of ground vehicles currently in use by the Alliance. Specifically, Sefla noted some of the benefits and shortcomings of such vehicles as the Kelliak Freerunner and Aratech Repulsor Company's Arrow-23 landspeeder. The report, along with Sefla's notes, was later presented to the leader of the Alliance, Mon Mothma.[4]
            By the year 0 BBY[5] Sefla had become a member of the Massassi Group, the most prominent rebel cell that was headquartered inside the Great Temple on the fourth moon of the planet Yavin.[2] Having attained the rank of lieutenant by that point, Sefla commanded a platoon of SpecForce soldiers.[6]
            In 0 BBY, through the efforts of Alliance Intelligence Captain Cassian Andor, the Rebellion learned about the existence of a planet-destroying superweapon that was being constructed by the Galactic Empire.[2] Alliance High Command then launched Operation Fracture,[7] an effort to extract Imperial engineer Galen Erso, who had designed the weapon, in order to learn more about his creation. Rebel forces successfully liberated Erso's daughter, Jyn, from a labor camp on the planet Wobani and brought her to Yavin.[2]
            Andor and the reprogrammed KX-series security droid K-2SO were dispatched alongside Jyn to the moon Jedha as a next part of the operation. On Jedha, a defected Imperial pilot—who claimed to be aware of Galen's whereabouts—had been captured by Saw Gerrera, the leader of the local Partisans and Jyn's onetime mentor. The Alliance hoped that Jyn would make contact with both Gererra and the pilot in order to learn the location of her father.[2]
            Meanwhile, Sefla was briefed on the course of Operation Fracture and was being prepared to participate in next phases of the plan. Sefla's platoon was on stand-by mode, ready to follow any leads to Erso that Andor would discover to any point of the galaxy. Constant duty shifts ensured that two squads within the platoon were combat-ready at any given time, while two others could be prepared within an hour.[7]
            Sefla researched the potential Imperial forces that Andor's team was likely to encounter on Jedha, presenting a detailed report to General Davits Draven. Realizing that the Empire would be unable to field heavy vehicles in the crowded streets of Jedha City, Sefla concluded that Andor and Erso would likely encounter TX-225 GAVw "Occupier" combat assault tanks, All Terrain Scout Transports, TIE strikers and a large number of stormtroopers. The lieutenant noted the presence of civilians in the area and was also wary of the potential presence of the elite death troopers, who were known to accompany the head of the superweapon project, Director Orson Krennic.[7]
            Sefla also took into account the possibility of Andor's mission going beyond the boundaries of the city, in which case the rebel team might be faced against heavier Imperial walkers, such as All Terrain Armored Transports or All Terrain Armored Cargo Transports. In that case, Sefla advised that Andor's group joined forces with Gerrera's partisans to combat the Imperials, even though the Alliance preferred to distance themselves from dealing with Gererra's group, on whose terrorist tactics they disagreed.[7]
            Andor and Jyn—accompanied by the defector Bodhi Rook as well as the Guardians of the Whills Baze Malbus and Chirrut Îmwe—escaped from Jedha before the Holy City was destroyed by the superweapon. Now knowing the named of the weapon, the Death Star, the group proceeded to the planet Eadu to contact Galen. However, as General Draven's actual goal was to kill Galen in order to prevent him from finishing work on the Death Star, Sefla's participation in the mission was rendered unnecessary. Instead, a squadron of starfighters were dispatched to Eadu, destroying the Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory and killing Galen.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Taidu_Sefla</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTaiduSefla</string></dict>
        <key>Andal Sait</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.337.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Andal Sait was a male Human who served as captain in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War. In 1 ABY, he commanded the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Blackguard. He went rogue and attempted to sell his command to Black Sun in the Bright Jewel system, while declaring himself to be a Grand Admiral.
            He showed interest in obtaining the Codex of Tython, an ancient Jedi holocron discovered by the agents of the Rebel Alliance. Looking to complete the Codex, a Rebel agent smuggled himself aboard the Blackguard, trying to obtain Sait's piece of the holocron. However, the fragment was secretly stolen from Sait by Adrick, an ambitious Imperial officer. The Rebel got into a firefight with Adrick and Sait, during which Sait escaped and Adrick was forced to hand over the fragment, before departing the Star Destroyer in a shuttle.[1]
            The holocron was reassembled and taken to Dantooine, however an ISB agent managed to recover it from Rebel hands. He contacted Sait, showing him the plans for a massive device that moved asteroids, stored in the holocron. Such device could crush a starship with its power or be used to bombard a planet with asteroids. Sait became interested by such a superweapon and asked the agent to deliver the holocron to him, along with the focusing crystal needed for the weapon. This allowed the Imperial engineers to install the superweapon aboard the Blackguard.[2]
            Later, Sait organized a ceremony to present various officers and dignitaries his newest acquisition—a CY-M Prototype battle droid—recovered by his troops on Mustafar. Unknown to all the guests, a group of undercover slicers aboard the Star Destroyer altered the programming of the droid. The CY-M, armed with a large vibro-ax, jumped into the crowd and started swinging its weapon in a deadly move. However, the droid was soon pushed into a nearby airlock, which was immediately opened into space.[2]
            Andal Sait was created for the Sony MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies Star Destroyer Heroic Encounter mission that was added to the game in early 2008. Star Wars Galaxies was shut down on December 15, 2011.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Andal_Sait</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAndalSait</string></dict>

        <key>Sarkli</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.339.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sarkli was a Human male captain in the Galactic Empire's Stormtrooper Corps during the Galactic Civil War. A member of the elite storm commandos, Sarkli was Admiral Firmus Piett's nephew and one of the Empire's best spies, even finding audience with Emperor Palpatine. Prior to his involvement in the Empire, Sarkli was an X-wing starfighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance, flying under Commander Luke Skywalker in Red Squadron. Sarkli was among the Rebel force that assisted in the evacuation of the Alliance's Yavin 4 base, and later assisted in the operation to extract Imperial defector Tycho Celchu from the planet Dantooine. Sarkli, who was known for his big ego, eventually defected to the Empire during a rebel defense of the planet Ralltiir.
            During his time with the Empire, Sarkli disrupted Rebel plans to free Alliance prisoners of war from a facility orbiting the planet Bakura, eventually being tracked to the planet Geonosis by the Rebel starfighter unit Rogue Squadron. He managed to survive this encounter, and was later assigned to the forest moon of Endor, where he guarded the shield bunker protecting the superweapon Death Star II. Sarkli would ultimately be killed during the Battle of Endor by General Han Solo of the Rebel Alliance, who infiltrated the bunker with a team of Rebel operatives.
            Sarkli, a Human male, was born prior to 0 BBY as the nephew of Firmus Piett, an Admiral under the galaxy's governing body, the Galactic Empire.[3] Sarkli was eventually pit against his uncle's side during the Galactic Civil War when he was recruited by the freedom-fighting movement known as the Rebel Alliance sometime around the Battle of Yavin. Following the destruction of the planet-destroying superweapon, the Death Star, during that battle, Sarkli took the place of fallen Rebel starfighter pilot Biggs Darklighter, flying under the X-wing starfighter unit Red Squadron.[1]
            During one of the routine raids on the Alliance's base on the moon Yavin 4 conducted by Imperial forces, Sarkli accompanied pilots Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles with the mission of defending the Rebel transport Luminous. Sarkli provided an aerial defense of the Great Temple while Skywalker and Antilles extracted General Jan Dodonna and Lieutenant Bren Derlin, who were trapped inside. Sarkli ultimately saved the group from a pair of Imperial scout walkers in the main hangar bay.[1]
            Sarkli later accompanied Red Squadron to a meeting with Tycho Celchu, a Rebel sympathizer wishing to defect from the Empire. However, when Celchu's rendezvous point on the planet Dantooine was compromised by Imperial storm commandos, the meeting was quickly converted into a rescue operation. Commander Skywalker took it upon himself to infiltrate the makeshift Imperial camp to rescue Celchu, ordering Sarkli and the rest of the strike team to wait with the ships. During Skywalker's absence, the team was wiped out by a sudden Imperial ambush, leaving Sarkli the only survivor, who reported what was happening to Skywalker when he and Celchu were arriving back to the landing area.[1]
            Sarkli later took part in a Rebel operation to save a group of scientists holed up by a team of storm commandos in a city on Ralltiir. Although Sarkli initially flew with Red Squadron during the mission and helped stem the flow of Imperial reinforcements, he used the battle as an opportunity to defect to the Empire, surrendering himself to a storm commando convoy.[1] Sarkli quickly made a name for himself in the Empire, becoming captain[2] of a storm commando unit. Sarkli also became a renowned spy, even finding personal favor with Emperor Palpatine.[3]
            Following the Battle of Hoth, Sarkli interfered with a Rebel rescue mission over the planet Bakura. Piloting an Imperial escort carrier, he boarded and destroyed a Rebel transport carrying several Rebel prisoners of war rescued from the orbital detainment facility before fleeing to Geonosis. He lured the pursuing Alliance fleet into an ambush in the Geonosian asteroid field, where he engaged in combat with former wingman Wedge Antilles. Sarkli's escort carrier sustained critical damage during the fight, forcing him to retreat to the planet's surface in an escape pod. Antilles pursued Sarkli into the Geonosian canyons, where Sarkli attacked him using a LAAT/i gunship. Using a single E-Web blaster cannon stolen from an Imperial stormtrooper, Antilles damaged Sarkli's gunship, causing it to careen into one of the canyon walls.[1]
            Sarkli managed to survive the incident,[1] and was later present on the superweapon Death Star II over the forest moon of Endor during Darth Vader's visit to the station in 4 ABY.[4]
            Sarkli was later assigned to the shield bunker on the sanctuary moon, commanding a storm commando sentry unit. His unit failed to prevent a Rebel strike team led by General Han Solo from entering the bunker and planting explosives. In a last ditch effort, Sarkli confronted Solo with a blaster rifle and attempted to block his escape from the exploding bunker, with Solo telling him that the Empire was finished, and Sarkli had chosen the wrong side. The two men simultaneously tried to kill each other and retreat from the bunker. Sarkli ultimately received a fatal wound from Solo's blaster near the main entrance after a short skirmish through the hallways, falling to Solo despite his skill with a blaster.[1] His uncle, Admiral Piett, would die in the same battle when Rebel pilot Arvel Crynyd careened his starfighter into the bridge of the flagship Executor.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sarkli</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSarkli</string></dict>
        <key>Satal Keto</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.340.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Satal Keto was a Human male native to the planet Empress Teta, the son of Lord Keto, nephew of Lady Magda Keto, and the cousin of Aleema Keto. He and Aleema co-founded the Krath, a secret dark side society, and together they succeeded in overthrowing the Tetan Monarchy just prior to the Great Sith War. As the new co-rulers of the Empress Teta system, Satal and Aleema instigated the conflict known as the Krath Holy Crusade. Keto's progression down the path of the dark side saw him transformed into an accomplished Sith magician, though his true talents were in the creation of poisons and other alchemical Sith practices.
            Shortly after the Battle of Koros Major, Satal and Aleema accepted a rogue Jedi named Ulic Qel-Droma into their fold. Time passed, and Keto grew increasingly suspicious of Qel-Droma, fearing he had ulterior motives for joining the Krath. As Qel-Droma advanced through the Krath ranks, he became Aleema's lover, further spurring Keto's jealousy and his suspicions of Qel-Droma's true purpose. It was not until another Jedi was captured in the streets of Cinnagar that Qel-Droma's infiltration plot was exposed, and Keto decided to have Qel-Droma assassinated. The assassination attempt failed, and during the resulting confrontation, Qel-Droma struck Keto down in a fit of rage.
            The son and daughter—though not siblings—of the then-rulers of the Empress Teta star system, Satal Keto and his cousin Aleema were the successors of the throne of Empress Teta, which was at that time occupied by Satal's father, Lord Keto, and Aleema's mother, Lady Magda Keto. Out of boredom, Satal, Aleema, and some of their socialite friends formed a secret society called the Krath, so named after a fairy-tale magician-god. The cousins learned much about the ancient Sith Empire, which instigated the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY—so much so that they were compelled to explore the history further on their own.[4]
            To appease their curiosity, Satal and Aleema planned and took a trip to the Galactic Museum on Coruscant, with hopes of finding anything related to the ancient Sith. As they browsed the museum, they were allowed access by the museum curator into the Hall of the Sith: a section dedicated exclusively to Sith history. The museum was currently in production of a new exhibit entitled "Dark Lords of the Sith," and from what the Ketos could see, there would be much to explore. The curator finally was convinced to allow Satal and Aleema to peruse the restricted exhibit, reasoning that it was highly unlikely someone would steal any of the various dark side artifacts, and even less likely that they would be used in an attempt to dominate the galaxy.[5] Satal proved the curator wrong, however, when at Aleema's prodding he stole an ancient Sith spellbook.[1]
            The book was written in the ancient Sith text, a language neither he nor Aleema was able to decipher. The downhearted cousins returned to their lodgings, where they scanned the current HoloNet News reports. Aleema stopped on a report about dark side users who, with their dark powers, were terrorizing the citizens of the planet Onderon. Satal and Aleema were intrigued by the fact that there were still dark side practitioners throughout the galaxy, and decided that traveling to Onderon was their best chance of learning the secrets of their stolen book. Armed with this new knowledge, the pair ditched their quarters, and left Coruscant aboard their pleasure yacht dubbed the Krath Enchanter on a direct path for Onderon.[5]
            When the Ketos exited hyperspace, they found that they had arrived in the midst of the Galactic Republic naval battle formation. Having been summoned by the Jedi Knights who were already entrenched there and engaged in battle with the planet's dark side-worshiping citizens, the fleet stationed itself in orbit around Onderon to prevent any unauthorized ships from coming or going. Noticing the civilian vessel, the captain of the Republic command ship Alliance I hailed the Krath Enchanter, informing its passengers that the planet was currently under siege, and advising them to steer clear of Onderon's orbit. Despite additional caution expressed by Aleema, Satal instead chose to disconnect the comlink and ignore the Republic ship captain's warning.[5]
            Keto then piloted the Enchanter through the formation, and through the atmosphere of the planet, only to find that Republic troops were already engaging the Onderonian forces. Trying to evade the battle, the Enchanter was caught in the crossfire of a Republic rocket-jumper air-to-ground assault, and crash-landed in the center of Iziz, Onderon's great walled city. Escaping the wreckage unharmed, the Ketos began wandering the streets of Iziz, beginning immediately their search for any practitioners of Sith teachings. They eventually made contact with several dark-siders, who in turn led them to Onderon's ruler, the sorcerer King Ommin.[5]
            Ommin himself was operating in his secret underground lair, while his dark side warriors were heavily engaged in combat with the combined forces of the Republic military and the Jedi Order. The King was in the midst of coordinating battle strategies when he was interrupted by his servant Novar, who informed him that during the battle, two visitors had arrived on Onderon claiming to be in possession of dark side treasures, and were requesting his audience. Curious that visitors would choose a tumultuous time such as this for a visit, and even more curious about the supposed treasures, Ommin allowed the two individuals to be brought before him.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Satal_Keto</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSatalKeto</string></dict>
        <key>Jun Sato</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.341.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jun Sato was a human male who commanded the Phoenix Cell, a resistance group that operated against the Galactic Empire in the years prior to the Battle of Yavin. He and his cell, which included a group of A-wing starfighters known as Phoenix Squadron, were affiliated with the larger rebel movement operated by Senator Bail Organa. At the recommendation of Senator Organa, Sato welcomed the Spectres into his fleet, and the two cells fought side by side in a number of engagements. Sato lost his command ship, Phoenix Home, after it was destroyed by the Sith Lord Darth Vader, after which Sato transferred his command to the CR90 corvette Liberator and later the Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier Phoenix Nest.
            Commander Sato and Captain Hera Syndulla continued leading the Phoenix Squadron in the period between 3 BBY and 2 BBY. During this time, Sato saw action in numerous missions and skirmishes against the Empire. Phoenix Squadron later established a base called Chopper Base on the planet Atollon. He reunited with his nephew Mart Mattin during the skirmish above Mykapo. After Phoenix Squadron joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Sato's forces joined forces with General Jan Dodonna's Massassi Group for a planned assault on Lothal. However, Grand Admiral Thrawn learned of their plans and attacked Atollon. Sato sacrificed his life during the Battle of Atollon in order to allow Ezra Bridger and Chopper to escape and seek help, killing Admiral Kassius Konstantine in the process.
            Jun Sato was a human male[3] from the planet Mykapo.[1] As a young man, he was offered a spot in a crystal smuggling ring, which he took for credits. As a cover, he got himself accepted into the prestigious crystal processing school of the planet Isobe, in the Thustra system. When most natives were hostile and even violent to him, Sato found comfort and support with Princess Althea, daughter of the planetary leader Lord Hallux, who would even tend to his wounds. Eventually, Sato was caught red-handed smuggling stolen crystals. Although he defended himself that night in front of Lord Hallux, his son Thelan and a very dismayed Althea, Sato was found guilty of the charge and banished from Isobe for the rest of his life, on pain of death. Because of his shame and pride, Sato never tried to contact Althea again after his banishment, although there was much he wanted to tell her.[6]
            By 4 BBY,[7] Commander Sato led the Phoenix Cell during the Age of the Empire. He and his forces were part of the larger rebel movement[3] that was loosely organized by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan, Senator Mon Mothma of Chandrila, and Commander Ahsoka Tano,[8] the latter of whom operated as a rebel informant under the codename "Fulcrum."[9] He had a brother and a nephew named Mart Mattin who were members of a small Mykapo-based rebel cell called Iron Squadron. At some unknown point, Sato lost contact with them after Imperial forces attacked and killed his brother. However, Mattin survived and took over leadership of the Iron Squadron.[10]
            Later, Commander Tano led forces[9] from the Phoenix cell[3] to the assistance of the Spectres, who mounted a mission to rescue their captive leader, the Jedi Kanan Jarrus, from Imperial custody over the planet Mustafar.[9] After the rescue, Sato welcomed the Spectres into his fleet, after they were highly recommended by Senator Organa and Commander Tano.[11]
            As part of the rebel fleet, the Spectres, aboard their ship the Ghost, carried out a number of attacks against Imperial targets, securing fuel for Phoenix Home and the CR90 corvettes that it led. After one such attack, in which the Spectres led the Phoenix cell's group of A-wing fighters, known as Phoenix Squadron, in an attempt to steal Imperial shield generators, Sato commended the Ghost crew for their work. Captain Hera Syndulla of the Ghost regretted being unable to secure the shield generators for the fleet, but they had secured additional fuel to maintain Phoenix operations. It was then that the crew's astromech droid C1-10P, nicknamed "Chopper," arrived in the Phoenix Home command center carrying a message from Lothal. The transmission was from Maketh Tua, a minister in Lothal's Imperial government, who requested that the rebels help her defect from the Empire in exchange for valuable intelligence; the secrets she was willing to share included the names of rebel sympathizers on Lothal and nearby worlds, as well as the true reason for the Empire's presence on Lothal. Commander Sato believed that the mission was worth the risk and allowed the Ghost crew to return to Lothal to help Minister Tua.[3]
            The rebels' return to their former world led to the Siege of Lothal, as Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau and Darth Vader, a Dark Lord of the Sith, pursued the rebels on the Outer Rim planet. The rebels escaped Lothal aboard a stolen shuttle after the Empire assassinated Tua, implicating the rebels in the crime, and they returned to Phoenix Home. Once there, they realized that the Empire had placed a tracking device on the shuttle. Their warning to Commander Sato came too late, however, as Darth Vader arrived alone in his TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. Sato ordered Phoenix Squadron to engage the Dark Lord, but Vader was the superior pilot and destroyed most of the squadron. Vader's attack led to Phoenix Home suffering critical damage and, despite the suggestions of Captain Syndulla—who, along with her crew had boarded the Ghost to engage Vader—Sato at first refused to abandon the command ship. Once it was apparent that Phoenix Home was lost, Commander Sato changed his mind and ordered an evacuation. He and his crew escaped as a fleet of Star Destroyers jumped into the area, and the Ghost provided enough of a diversion so the crew could board the rest of the fleet and jump into hyperspace.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jun_Sato</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJunSato</string></dict>
        <key>San'sii</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.342.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>San'sii "the Kursk" was a male Human who became the leader of the Force-using organization known as the Blackguard on the planet Mustafar during the Galactic Civil War.[1] During his time as leader he recruited many non-Force sensitive individuals into the Blackguard, which went against Blackguard tradition[2]. He along with a large portion of the Blackguard were killed by spacers during the Blackguard Purge.[1]
            San'sii was a Force-sensitive Human male who joined the Force-using organization known as the Blackguard prior to or during the Galactic Civil War. He rose to become the leader of the group, a position known as the Kursk, and became one of its strongest members.[1] Whilst head of the group he felt that the cult was too small in size, and introduced a new rule allowing non-Force sensitive individuals to join to boost numbers. This broke tradition running back to the founding of the group after the Seventh Battle of Ruusan by the Dark Jedi Vulta Daanat. The new troops quickly filled out the Blackguard's ranks and soon became the most visible part of the faction, leading many who encountered the group to believe they were simply a paramilitary organization rather than a Force-using cult.[2]
            In 1 ABY a Sullustan archaeologist named Mi Fon Lu wished to research within the Southern Jedi Ruins in which the Blackguard made their home. However fearing for his safety amongst the Blackguard he hired spacers to clear out the ruins. San'sii was killed along with the rest of the Blackguard in the ruins during what became known as the Blackguard Purge.[1]
            San'sii used a Red bladed lightsaber in combat as did most members of the Blackguard, however instead of the normal Blackguard masked uniform San'sii wore the Cloak of the Kursk, a unique robe worn only by the leader of the Blackguard. After his death the cloak was taken by the spacers who killed him.[1]
            San'sii first appeared as an enemy in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies as part of the Trials of Obi-Wan expansion released in 2005. Star Wars Galaxies was shut down on December 15, 2011. In the game he appeared as an elite enemy who players had to kill as part of the quest 'An Archaeologists Problem'. He later received a card in the Agents of Deception expansion of the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game released in 2009. San'sii was also mentioned as the most recent leader of the Blackguard in the Wizards of the Coast Saga Edition Roleplaying game supplement book, the Jedi Academy Training Manual which also established it was he who introduced the policy of recruiting non-force sensitive as members of the Blackguard.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/San%27sii</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSan'sii</string></dict>

            Virgilio was a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Prior to the Battle of Endor he served as third officer on a Corellian Gunship. His ship rescued the six remaining members of a Bothan Spynet team that had been working in the Outer Rim Territories. Impressed by their bravery he became a strong supporter of the Bothans, and of Councilor Borsk Fey'lya.
            During the Thrawn crisis, Virgilio, now promoted to Captain, commanded the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Quenfis, part of the Home Guard Fleet. Borsk Fey'lya sent him to arrest Han Solo and his companions during the Katana fleet incident. During the conflict Fey'lya was tricked into revealing his true intentions, and Virgilio proved himself loyal to the New Republic by supporting Solo and Rogue Squadron in the ensuing battle.[1]
            According to his entry in the Dark Force Rising Sourcebook (and republished in The Thrawn Trilogy Sourcebook), it was his ship that recovered the Bothans carrying the Death Star II plans, conflicting with Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sarin_Virgilio</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSarinVirgilio</string></dict>

        <key>Nurik Sandral</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.345.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nurik Sandral was a Human male who moved to Dantooine shortly after Ahlan Matale moved there. The two men owned the largest farms on Dantooine, and soon developed a vicious feud.
            At some point in his life, Nurik's wife died, and he raised both his children on his own. He eventually moved his family to Dantooine. There, he met Ahlan Matale and, despite getting along at first, they soon started fighting. Many people, including Vandar Tokare, considered Nurik to be the more sensible of the two.
            Nurik's son, Casus, was an amateur archaeologist, and sought to understand the Rakatan ruins on Dantooine, but was slain by kath hounds. When he failed to re-appear, Nurik assumed Ahlan had kidnapped him, and imprisoned Ahlan's son, Shen.
            When Revan came to the Sandral estate to inform Nurik of Casus's true fate, Revan met Rahasia, Nurik's daughter. She was in love with Shen, and asked Revan to rescue him. The two young lovers defied their fathers and ran off together to the outside of the estate. The two bitter old men blamed each other until Revan convinced them to let their children live their own lives, leading the two fathers to purchase an estate for Shen and Rahasia and take steps toward ending their long feud.
            Terena Adare, the leader of Khoonda during the First Jedi Purge, mentioned that Nurik's family was "removed" from Dantooine at some point around the time of the Sith attack on Dantooine.
            Even if the player tells Nurik of Casus' death, he'll still be convinced Ahlan is responsible for taking him.
            If Revan fails to convince Ahlan and Nurik to allow their children to live their own lives, Rahasia runs away with Shen and take up residence in the Jedi Enclave, leaving Nurik enraged.
            If the player chooses the dark side option, they can lie to Nurik by telling him that Ahlan killed Casus. Then, in a rage, Nurik kills Shen and in response Ahlan kills Rahasia. Nurik then kills Ahlan and Ahlan's droids kill him, then the droids turn on the player character which results in a battle with the droids. The player has the option to talk to the Jedi Council and they will question him about the incident. The player character can lie to the Council and gain dark side points.
            It is also possible to convince Shen to leave Rahasia and return home with his father. If this happens, a heartbroken Rahasia is left in Nurik's care.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nurik_Sandral</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNurikSandral</string></dict>

        <key>Casus Sandral</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.347.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Casus Sandral was a Human male living on Dantooine during the time of the Jedi Civil War. He was a member of the Sandral family, being the son of Nurik and the brother of Rahasia. He befriended Shen Matale after his sister fell in love with the Matale despite paternal friction between the two families. Casus was an archaeologist interested in the ancient ruins of Dantooine, but he was killed by kath hounds while on an expedition to one site. His father believed that his nemesis, Ahlan Matale, was responsible for Casus's death until Revan, a Jedi, was able to settle the dispute between the families peacefully.
            A male Human, Casus Sandral was the son of Nurik Sandral and brother to Rahasia Sandral. At some point the children's mother died, leaving Nurik to raise his children by himself. Nurik moved his family to the planet Dantooine in search of peace and safety, arriving shortly after Ahlan Matale had done the same with his family. The two men fell into a series of disputes with each other and developed a hostile relationship which they attempted to enforce on their children. However, their efforts were not entirely successful as Casus' sister Rahasia met with Ahlan's son Shen when they were alone and fell in love. Casus later met with Shen and the two began to form a friendship.[1]
            Casus was an amateur archaeologist and worked on digs while on Dantooine around the time of the Jedi Civil War. He was investigating strange ruins across the planet[1] and, in 3956 BBY,[2] he made an expedition to ruins[3] of an origin he noted in his personal datapad as "The Rak". Before Casus reached the ruins, however, he was attacked by a pack of kath hounds—vicious predatory animals—and mauled to death. Unaware of Casus' fate, his father believed that his disappearance was the fault of the Matale family, and kidnapped Shen Matale in retaliation.[1]
            The Jedi Padawan Revan soon came across the archaeologist's body while investigating the disappearance of Shen Matale. Revan collected Casus' diary from his remains and returned it to his grieving father, declining Nurik's financial reward. The Padawan then peacefully resolved the dispute between the two families, allowing Casus' sister and her lover to live their lives together with their fathers' blessings.[1]
            Casus had a loving relationship with his father but did not share the elder's hostility towards the Matale family, even becoming friends with Shen Matale shortly before his death. He also kept a diary in which he logged his private thoughts. His hair and eyes were grey in color, and his skin fair.[1]
            Casus used a datapad for keeping his diary. When he set out on his fateful expedition, he carried an energy shield and light armor of Echani make as well as a Verpine headband and a cardio package implant.[1]
            Casus was a background character in the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. In his dead appearance Casus's skin color was light instead of dark like his family, as the graphical model used for his corpse was a generic one used throughout the game.[1]
            In Knights of the Old Republic, it is possible for the player to miss or otherwise ignore Casus's corpse and thus the diary is not returned. The Sandral-Matale feud quest can still progress to completion, and the player can take a dark side path at the conclusion by lying to Nurik and blaming Ahlan Matale for Casus's death, resulting in both families killing each other.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Casus_Sandral</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCasusSandral</string></dict>

        <key>Thrackan Sal-Solo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.349.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Thrackan Sal-Solo was a Human male who was the son of Randil Sal and Tiion Sal-Solo and the first cousin of Han Solo. He was a few years older than Han and bore a striking resemblance to his cousin. Thrackan even had a voice that corresponded to Han's. Known to the galaxy as a convicted felon, Sal-Solo, despite his vicious crimes, came into power multiple times. As of 40 ABY, Thrackan became Head of State of Corellia and its Minister of War. He was responsible for the Second Galactic Civil War.
            During the war, Thrackan issued a bounty on Han Solo's family, hiring Boba Fett's daughter, Ailyn Vel, to carry out the job. However, his plan to rule Corellia backfired as he was killed by Boba Fett, Mirta Gev, and Han Solo.
            His father died when he was very young, and his mother was a reclusive, distrustful woman, who surrounded herself with a staff of droid servants. The family was apparently descended from the ancient emperors of Corellia, and while his lonely childhood left him arrogant and domineering, Tiion Sal-Solo nevertheless raised her son to think of himself as a gentleman.
            In 18 BBY, Thrackan encountered his cousin Han, a teenage orphan who had run away from gangster Garris Shrike and was searching for clues about his own origins. His mother, when introduced to Han, became hysterical after noticing his resemblance to her lost loved ones. Thrackan angrily pulled Han from the room, blaming him for upsetting her. When Han asked what was wrong with her, Thrackan became angrier and struck him, shouting that there was nothing wrong with Tiion and that Han had no right to talk about her.[4]
            Despite the way this first meeting unfolded, Han stayed with Thrackan for a short time in an attempt to learn about the rest of his family and because he had nowhere else to go—Han feared Thrackan would turn him over to the authorities if he were ever to defy him, which would result in his being found and recaptured by Shrike.[4]
            Han found his cousin to be a violent bully; seen from the other side, however, it is not impossible that Han's existence had shattered Thrackan's belief that he was the rightful heir of Corellia's ancient monarchy. Be that as it may, during his stay with Thrackan, Han endured much abuse both physical and verbal from the older boy. In order to placate his cousin Han was required to do everything he was told, including helping to break into and burglarize neighboring homes and try to teach Thrackan to pilot a speeder. Thrackan would torture animals or insects for fun, doing it more frequently once he realized how much it unsettled Han to have to watch.
            One day, Thrackan's bullying became too much for Han. When Thrackan held a knife to him and threatened him with cutting off his ears, Han attacked his bigger cousin with a viciousness and talent that he learned on the street, which caught Thrackan off guard. Han savagely beat Thrackan and finally held a knife to his throat, the same knife Thrackan had been threatening Han with moments earlier.
            Han forced the terrified Thrackan to tell him about everything he knew about their family, with Thrackan answering truthfully. Once Han became calmer and let down his guard, Thrackan overpowered him and locked him in a storeroom for three days, feeding him only bread and water, vowing to make him sorry. Han's confinement ended when Thrackan walked into the room accompanied by Garris Shrike; his cousin had cruelly decided to turn him back over to the sadistic captain. This incident was the first of many which would lead to a lifelong family feud between Thrackan and Han.
            Thrackan later attempted to pursue a career in the Imperial Navy, but Han's cashiering, smuggling career and fighting with the Rebellion thwarted his ambition, and confined him to a bureaucratic role within the Corellian sector. Nevertheless, Thrackan's ruthless ambition and his family connections enabled him to prosper in the Imperial administration, and when Daclif Gallamby became Diktat in 2 BBY, Thrackan was appointed as his deputy. He found himself frustrated in his romantic ambitions, however, as women often tended to think of him not on his own terms, but merely as Han Solo's cousin. His sense that his cousin thwarted him in every aspect of his life was further compounded when the Imperial government on Corellia was undermined by the Battle of Endor and the subsequent rise of the New Republic—with Han, of course, playing a vital role in the Rebel victory.
            Eventually, when the New Republic took control of Corellia, Thrackan disappeared. He formed a speciesist underground movement known as the Human League, and allied himself with the Sacorrian Triad, who had control of Centerpoint Station—or perhaps more specifically with the Imperial General who was one of the Sacorrian troika.[5]
            In 18 ABY, Han and his family arrived in the system, on a diplomatic mission to end the First Corellian Insurrection,[5] and the two cousins met again for the first time in more than thirty years. Thrackan declared himself Diktat[7] and attempted to kill Han, but his attempts were foiled by Han's children, and he was arrested.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thrackan_Sal-Solo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascThrackanSalSolo</string></dict>
        <key>Sifo-Dyas</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.350.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sifo-Dyas was a human male Jedi Master from Minashee who commissioned the Kaminoans' creation of the Grand Army of the Republic over a decade before the Clone Wars. A Jedi from the Cassandran Worlds, Sifo-Dyas was gifted with the power of foresight, and he earned a seat on the Jedi High Council prior to the Invasion of Naboo. When he foresaw a coming war that would ravage the galaxy, he believed that the Galactic Republic would require an army if it were to prevail. Yet, his peers on the Jedi Council rejected his notions, leading to his removal from the Council. Nevertheless, he pursued his ideas in secret and contacted the Kaminoan cloners, purporting to have the authorization of the Council and the Galactic Senate to raise an army for the Republic. In doing so, he unknowingly entered the crosshairs of the Sith, who set out to assume control of his cloning project.
            Around the time of the Invasion of Naboo, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum requested Sifo-Dyas conduct clandestine negotiations with the Pyke Syndicate, and he headed for Oba Diah with Valorum's personal aide, Silman. However, the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus hired the Pykes to target Sifo-Dyas's T-6 shuttle, and they shot down his ship over the Oba Diah moon. Sifo-Dyas died in the resulting crash, but Silman survived and was taken prisoner by the Pykes. Consequently, Tyranus and his Sith Master, Darth Sidious, funded Sifo-Dyas's army of clone troopers, hired the bounty hunter Jango Fett to serve as a genetic template, instructed the Kaminoan cloners to add Order 66 to the clones' control chips (which Sifo-Dyas originally intended to be a safeguard against any treacherous orders given to clones), and manipulated the Jedi Order into taking command of the army when the Clone Wars erupted. It was not until years later that the Jedi began to unravel the Sith's conspiracy and unearthed the details of Sifo-Dyas's demise.
            Hailing from Minashee[1] in the Cassandran Worlds,[4] was the son of a fisherman. Discovered by the Jedi Order as an infant by the Jedi Master Mayoda, Sifo-Dyas would eventually be placed into the Hawkbat Clan where he became close friends with Dooku from Serenno.[1] 
            Eventually he ended up becoming a Jedi Master and a leading member of the Jedi High Council, the governing body of the Order, in the last decades of the Galactic Republic. However, some time prior to the Invasion of Naboo, tensions arose between Sifo-Dyas and his fellow councilors. Foreseeing an upcoming full-scale conflict, he started advocating for the creation of an army for the Republic. The rest of the High Council deemed his ideas too extreme, and Sifo-Dyas was removed from his position. Even though the other Jedi had rejected his project, he found a way to carry it out without their consent. Sifo-Dyas contacted the Kaminoans, who were reputed for their clone hatcheries, and secretly commissioned them to grow a clone army for the Republic,[2] which he pretended was a request of the Galactic Senate.[3]
            Some time later, Master Sifo-Dyas was sent on a secret mission by Finis Valorum, the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, who asked him to deal with the Pyke Syndicate. Valorum also asked his personal aide, Silman, to accompany the Jedi on his way to the planet Oba Diah, where the Pykes were headquartered. However, Sifo-Dyas was never able to complete the Chancellor's mission, as the High Council called him to deal with another conflict: on Felucia, a skirmish had broken out between the local tribes, and Sifo-Dyas was assigned to quell the conflict. As a consequence, both Sifo-Dyas and Silman were diverted to Felucia aboard T-6 shuttle 77519.[2]
            However, neither man would ever reach their destination. In the shadows, the Sith wished to take over the clone army in the future, and they plotted against Sifo-Dyas' life. Count Dooku of Serenno, a defrocked Jedi now known as the Sith Lord named Darth Tyranus, hired the Pykes to kill Sifo-Dyas. Since those criminals wished to gain an advantage over rival crime families, they accepted Tyranus' offer and shot down Sifo-Dyas' shuttle over the Oba Diah moon. After inspecting the wreckage, they turned over the Jedi Master's corpse to Tyranus as proof of their deal fulfilled. While Sifo-Dyas had died in the crash, Silman was still alive when the Pykes inspected the wreckage. They decided to keep the Chancellor's aide locked up in their prison as insurance, recognizing that dealing with a Sith Lord like Tyranus would require it.[2]
            Ten years after the Jedi Master's death, the army he had commissioned was discovered by Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi Knight who was investigating on Kamino following the murder of the bounty hunter Zam Wesell by a mysterious colleague of hers, Jango Fett. To his great surprise, Kenobi was greeted by Taun We, a Kaminoan, as if they had been expecting his visit for some time. Prime Minister Lama Su then informed the Jedi of the progress of the clone army ordered by Sifo-Dyas some ten years ago. Although he did not know what the cloners were talking about, Kenobi played along so he could learn more. He bluffed his way into the heart of the hatcheries, and was introduced to the original source of the clones, which was none other than Jango Fett. As soon as he took leave of the Kaminoans, Kenobi contacted the High Council and told them of the clone army and how Sifo-Dyas was supposed to have commissioned it. The Council members, however, had been completely unaware of it for ten years. Ultimately, Sifo-Dyas' clone army ended up being used at the behest of the Republic, and the conflict between the Separatists and the Republic was named "the Clone Wars" after it.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sifo-Dyas</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSifoDyas</string></dict>

        <key>Lor San Tekka</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.352.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lor San Tekka was a human male explorer and member of the Church of the Force who was born in the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He became a believer in the ideals of the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars, despite not being Force-sensitive, and followed the underground faith of his church during the dark times of the Galactic Empire's rule over the galaxy. San Tekka found Jedi lore that the Empire attempted to suppress, and his knowledge of the galaxy and its history was useful to the New Republic after it prevailed over the Empire during the Battle of Endor and began a period of galactic reconstruction. Lor San Tekka also helped Luke Skywalker, the last known Jedi Knight at the time, seek out Jedi lore that the Empire had attempted to destroy. At some point, San Tekka lived with the Crèche and learned about their spiritual culture.
            After Skywalker's new generation of Jedi was destroyed by his nephew and apprentice, Kylo Ren, Skywalker went into exile and sought out the first Jedi Temple on Ahch-To. San Tekka, who retired to a spiritual village on the planet Jakku, discovered a fragment of a map that could lead to Ahch-To. He was sought by the Resistance, led by Skywalker's sister, General Leia Organa, as well as the resurgent Imperial force known as the First Order. San Tekka gave the map fragment to Resistance Commander Poe Dameron and was soon captured by Kylo Ren, who demanded to know where the map was. When San Tekka refused to comply, Ren killed him. San Tekka's sacrifice was not in vain; the map was given to the Resistance, and a young Force-user named Rey followed it to Ahch-To and found the exiled Jedi Master.
            Lor San Tekka was born in the waning years of the Galactic Republic. As a young man, he came to have a high regard for the Jedi Order and knew about the actions of the Jedi Knights during the Clone Wars. After the rise of the Galactic Empire and the destruction of the Jedi, San Tekka never believed the Emperor when he branded the Jedi as traitors. San Tekka was a member of the Church of the Force during the dark times of Imperial rule, following the underground faith that believed in the Jedi ideals despite not being Force-sensitive himself. He uncovered much of the history of the Jedi Knights that the Empire attempted to bury, leading many individuals to seek him out for his knowledge of Jedi lore.[1]
            San Tekka was a seasoned traveler and explorer on the remote fringes of the galaxy. Following the defeat of the Empire at the Battle of Endor, San Tekka aided the fledgling New Republic by providing bureaucrats with information regarding worlds across the galaxy. This helped the New Republic greatly, as the Empire destroyed many documents that would have been useful for galactic reconstruction.[1] As an ally of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and his sister Princess Leia Organa, San Tekka helped the last Jedi recover secret Jedi lore that the Empire had tried to erase.[3] He also came to know Ben Solo, the son of Organa and the smuggler Han Solo, who San Tekka later found out turned to the dark side of the Force and became Kylo Ren after destroying Skywalker's new generation of Jedi. Skywalker vanished into exile after his Jedi were destroyed and went off in search of the first Jedi Temple[2] on the planet Ahch-To.[4] After many years, San Tekka discovered a partial map that revealed the location of the first Jedi temple.[2]
            At some point, San Tekka lived with the Crèche on Ovanis, where they guarded a sacred egg that they believed would hatch a savior who would bring salvation to the galaxy. San Tekka lived there for two years to learn about the Crèche, who were a very protective people. He gained their trust because of how much time he spent there learning their ways, and they referred to him as "the explorer."[5]
            The Resistance, a military force led by now-General Organa, and the First Order, a resurgent Imperial force led by the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke, both learned that San Tekka had the map to Skywalker in his possession.[2] Hoping that her brother could help defeat the First Order, Organa sent Commander Poe Dameron, a pilot in the Resistance, to search for San Tekka.[5]
            Following San Tekka's trail, Poe and Black Squadron traveled to Ovanis. There, Dameron met with the Crèche, whom the explorer had met a long time ago.[5] Dameron was followed by the First Order Agent Terex,[6] who had learned of his presence through a spy.[7] After the skirmish on Ovanis, Black Squadron traveled to the prison world of Megalox Beta to question Grakkus the Hutt about his encounter with San Tekka.[8] Despite facing opposition from Terex, Black Squadron managed to rescue Grakkus, who gave him information on the places that San Tekka had visited.[7]
            Later, San Tekka travelled to Cato Neimoidia where he disguised, went on a guided tour in the Palace of Baron Paw Maccon. He broke off from the group and headed into the vaults. Using a special cloak he managed to walk through laser and get into one of the vaults. Inside was a golden box. San Tekka opened it and found an ancient object crafted by using both the light side and dark side of the Force. His break-in hadn't gone unnoticed, though, and guards appeared, arresting San Tekka.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lor_San_Tekka</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLorSanTekka</string></dict>
        <key>Tiber Saxon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.353.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tiber Saxon was a human male who served as the governor of Mandalore following the death of his brother, Viceroy Gar Saxon. During the Mandalorian civil war against Clan Wren and House Kryze, Saxon deployed the Duchess, mounted on a modified AT-DP. The weapon, originally designed by the Mandalorian Sabine Wren, was designed to lock on to Mandalorian armor and vaporize the wearer. Saxon perished when Wren and her comrades infiltrated Saxon's Star Destroyer, based in Sundari, to destroy the weapon, eventually succeeding and destroying Saxon's vessel in the process, with Saxon still aboard.
            Upon Gar Saxon's death at the hands of Clan Wren,[3] Tiber succeeded his late brother as the governor of Mandalore, in service to the Galactic Empire. Desiring a way to gain power over the rebellious clan, and those who had sided with them in the civil war, Tiber had the Arc Pulse Generator, a superweapon that Sabine Wren had built during her days as a cadet at the Imperial Academy of Mandalore that was also known as the Duchess, rebuilt. The weapon was designed to kill Mandalorian warriors by targeting the beskar alloy in their armor and superheating it, disintegrating the wearer. Sabine had erased the plans and sabotaged the prototype before defecting, out of horror that the Empire had turned her creation on her own people. Tiber himself, due to eschewing Mandalorian armor in favor of Imperial Jumptrooper armor, made of plastoid, wasn't bothered by the ramifications.[1]
            Later, Tiber learned that Sabine had returned to Mandalore to gain support for the growing rebellion and to search for her father, Alrich Wren,[1] who had been taken hostage by the Empire to ensure his family's compliance.[3] Tiber had Alrich moved from the capital of Sundari to a remote prison to isolate him from his contacts in the capital. When he found out that Sabine and her forces were planning to attack the prison, Tiber secretly had Alrich placed on a convoy back to Sundari, intending to lay a trap for the rebels at the prison.[1]
            However, Sabine's attack succeeded, with the assistance of reinforcements from Bo-Katan Kryze. Sabine's mother, Countess Ursa Wren, had discovered Alrich's true whereabouts, but was unable to warn her daughter earlier due to Imperial jamming. The Imperial convoy transporting Alrich was ambushed by the rebels, and Tiber told his men to stay put, as reinforcements would be arriving. The Imperial Troop Transport carrying Alrich and its two escorts diverted off into a canyon, where they were attacked by Sabine, Kryze, Fenn Rau, Ezra Bridger, Kanan Jarrus and Chopper, who successfully freed Alrich. Tiber unleashed the Duchess against the Clan Wren warriors at the original battle site, killing many of them. The attack failed to kill Ursa and Tristan Wren, who had narrowly avoided the weapon's area of effect thanks to a warning from Sabine, who had recognized the weapon's sound over the comms.[1]
            On his own Star Destroyer, Tiber showed the results of the test of the Duchess to Grand Admiral Thrawn. The Grand Admiral was impressed with its power, but knew that Tiber had been trying to hide its flaws, namely that the weapon only had a very short range. Thrawn suggested that Tiber capture Sabine so she could improve it, which he agreed to. Captain Hark continued to protest the use of the Duchess, concerned that it was only a matter of time before the Empire turned it against all Mandalorians, both those loyal to the Empire and those who were not. Tiber set a trap, knowing that the rebels could not ignore such a dangerous weapon.[1]
            His trap worked, as a rebel strike team led by Sabine arrived in the hopes of destroying the Duchess. Tiber confronted Sabine and Kryze, demanding Sabine re-calibrate the weapon so that he could bring Mandalore under his role. Hark continued to protest, suspecting that the Empire would use it on them when they had no need of them, so Tiber had the machine zap him in response. After Tiber threatened to kill Kryze, Sabine eventually agreed to re-calibrate the Duchess, so he temporarily shut the weapon down. Knowing that Tiber would not hold his word, Sabine secretly reset the Duchess to target Imperial armor instead. When Sabine was finished, Tiber attempted to electrocute the three Mandalorians, but when he turned the weapon on again he was shocked to find himself being zapped by the Duchess. The weapon was reactivated at a high enough strength to incapacitate all of the Imperial soldiers on the Star Destroyer. Sabine considered killing Saxon with the weapon, but Kryze talked her down, reminding her that doing so was fighting like the Empire, in a cowardly fashion. Hark used the opportunity to flee. Sabine instead used the Darksaber to breach the weapon's core, and the strike team fled before the Star Destroyer blew up, killing Tiber.[1]
            Tiber Saxon, like his late brother Gar, had sworn loyalty to the Empire in exchange for power. Tibor Saxon was very ruthless, and wanting to earn the respect of the Emperor. Unlike Gar, however, Tiber was willing to throw away all vestiges of his Mandalorian heritage, stating that the culture had to "evolve" to fit in with the times. As a sign of this, he wore Jumptrooper armor, made of plastoid, instead of the Imperial Super Commando armor his brother wore, made of the traditional beskar alloy. He wanted all of his people to kneel before him, and was willing to use the Duchess to kill untold numbers to do it. Tiber's adherence to Imperial ways came about, in part, because, according to him, Emperor Palpatine had shown him the path to true power. He was overall ruthless and would attempt to defeat anyone in his way, including Captain Hark, one of his own men.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tiber_Saxon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTiberSaxon</string></dict>

        <key>Sajar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.356.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sajar was a Human male who was known as Darth Sajar during his time as a Dark Lord of the Sith and member of the ruling Dark Council of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War. He attempted to trap and kill the Jedi Master Tol Braga on the planet Dantooine, but Braga convinced Sajar to abandon the Sith and join the Jedi Order. Sajar renounced the Empire and his seat on the Council to become Braga's Padawan, and he studied the ways of the light side of the Force throughout the rest of the war and the subsequent Cold War.
            However, while Sajar was stationed on Quesh in 3642 BBY to guard a military base, he was caught in an Imperial invasion. Slipping back into the grasp of the dark side after killing several prisoners and being recognized by Imperial forces, Sajar decided to die a servant of the light at the hands of the Emperor's Wrath, the Sith Emperor's personal executioner, rather than become a Sith once more. However, Sajar and the troopers of the Republic Military's Eighty-sixth Infantry received reinforcements when Braga sent the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython to rescue Sajar. The Knight's efforts in the battle to save the base ensured that Sajar could return to the Jedi and receive redemption.
            A Human male born well over several decades before the end of the Great Galactic War with the Galactic Republic, Sajar was powerful enough in the Force to become[1] Darth Sajar,[2] a Sith Lord and a member of the Sith Empire's ruling Dark Council[1] sometime after 3678 BBY.[3] During his tenure as a Dark Lord of the Sith on the Council, Sajar learned of the existence of the Children of the Emperor—the agents who were unknowing extensions of the Sith Emperor's will.[4] Sometime before the end of the war in 3653 BBY,[5] Sajar lured the Jedi Master Tol Braga into a trap on the planet Dantooine by professing a desire for peace. The Kel Dor Jedi had contacted many Sith during the conflict in an attempt to start peace talks, and Sajar took advantage of this by attempting to kill the Jedi Master when he arrived.[6] The two dueled for a total of three days, debating the Force and their respective sides throughout the entire fight. Their fight ended when Braga convinced Sajar to abandon the dark side and join the Jedi Order, and the Sith Lord renounced his title to become Braga's Padawan.[1]
            As Braga's student, Sajar studied the light side of the Force during the rest of the war and the subsequent Cold War after sharing much of his knowledge of the Empire with the Jedi Council.[1] Among the information he gave the Council was the existence of the Children, though their purpose or locations remained unknown to the Jedi.[4] Sajar served as the inspiration for Braga's later mission to capture and redeem the Sith Emperor himself. He was still a Padawan[1] by the year 3642 BBY,[7] by which time Braga had sent Sajar on an assignment from the Jedi homeworld of Tython to guard the Republic's Adrenal Research Base on Quesh. Quesh's adrenal production made the planet a vital Republic resource, but its peacefulness made it a good place for Sajar to meditate while also serving the Republic. The facility was guarded by a detachment from the Republic Military's Eighty-sixth Infantry under Lieutenant Gundo. However, that peace was shattered when the Empire invaded, and Gundo's scouts captured several Imperial scouts. The Republic troopers turned the prisoners over to Sajar for interrogation, but the scouts angered the Padawan and caused his Sith personality to resurface. Just as Darth Sajar would have done, Sajar brutally murdered the defenseless and shackled prisoners, and lied to Gundo and his men when they learned of their deaths.[1]
            Imperial forces soon arrived outside the cliffs within which the facility was located, and in a frenzy of anger Sajar telekinetically hurled the scouts' corpses at his enemies. An Imperial officer recognized Sajar as the traitorous Darth Sajar and warned the former Sith that the Emperor's Wrath—the Sith Emperor's personal immortal executioner and an individual whom even the Dark Council feared—was coming. Regaining control of himself, Sajar decided that he would rather die at the Wrath's hand than become Darth Sajar once more, and he refused to fight, knowing that doing so would cause him to return to the dark side. Bereft of Sajar's aid, Gundo ordered his men to prepare their defenses anyway, and Sajar ignored his Master's attempts to reach him via holocomm. Braga learned of the situation from Gundo and sent the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython to Quesh in order to rescue Sajar, and the despondent Padawan revealed the truth to the Hero upon the Knight's arrival.[1]
            When Gundo requested the Jedi's aid in defending the main entrance while his engineers jury-rigged some ray shield generators, Sajar begged the Knight not to ask him to fight, and the Hero acknowledged the Padawan's request by ordering him to help the engineers set up the ray shields. While the Knight and a companion battled Imperial and Sith attackers and pushed them back to the facility's main entrance, Sajar worked with the 86th's engineers to bring the ray shields online, and with Sajar's help they were able to seal the base in half the time it would normally have taken. After the shields were activated, the Hero encountered Lord Scourge, the Emperor's Wrath, who showed interest in the Knight before departing and leaving Sajar to his own fate. Once the Hero returned, Sajar agreed with the other Jedi's suggestion that he return to Tython, but the Hero reminded the Padawan that Braga had sent aid because he cared for his student—and he would forgive Sajar's actions if given the chance.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sajar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSajar</string></dict>
        <key>Naga Sadow</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.357.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Naga Sadow was a master Sith alchemist and Dark Lord of the Sith who, in 5000 BBY, took the Sith Empire to the brink of galactic domination in the Great Hyperspace War. A half-breed Sith from Ziost, Sadow ruled over a secret citadel on the moon Khar Shian, where he became one of the most powerful Sith magicians of his time. A member of the ten-member Sith Council under Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos' reign, Sadow's preached an expansionist philosophy put him at odds with much of the isolated Empire's establishment. Sadow was considered a major candidate for Dark Lord after Ragnos' death, leading him into a power struggle with conservative rival Ludo Kressh that only ended with the surprise arrival of two explorers from the far-off Republic.
            Sadow saw opportunity in the the two explorers—siblings Gav and Jori Daragon—and used the suspicion and fear raised by their arrival to foment war with the Republic. Along the way, Sadow shattered Kressh's forces at Khar Delba, leaving no challengers to his authority. With Kressh seemingly out of the picture, Sadow gathered together all the Sith Lords and built a formidable military force to conquer the Republic, while also taking Gav Daragon as his Sith apprentice. When the time was right, Sadow and his forces launched a massive surprise attack on the Republic, a many-pronged strike aimed at conquering the important Koros system while seizing the Republic capital of Coruscant. For his part, Sadow stayed isolated in his Sith meditation sphere, augmenting his forces with illusory beasts and ships.
            Sadow's efforts initially met with great success, and he was on the cusp of victory when events turned against him. Gav Daragon turned coat once back home and attacked Sadow in his meditation sphere, breaking his concentration and dissipating his illusions. His momentum halted, Sadow killed Daragon and fled home, only to find a still-alive Ludo Kressh waiting for him with his own army. Sadow managed to deal his rival a final defeat before immediately being forced into battle again with a pursuing Republic force. Seeing he could not win, Sadow escaped with a daring run through the twin stars of the Denarii Nova, and making his way to the uninhabited moon of Yavin 4. Sadow practiced his alchemy alone there for decades, building massive temple complexes, before voluntarily placing himself in suspended animation. He was awoken some 600 years later by a fallen Jedi named Freedon Nadd, who learned the former Dark Lord of the Sith's secrets before killing him.
            Naga Sadow was born on the planet Ziost in the Sith Empire, a rich but isolated civilization[1] concealed from the greater galaxy by the difficult-to-navigate nebula known as the Stygian Caldera.[6] Around two thousand years before Sadow's lifetime, the Second Great Schism led to war between Jedi, with a cadre of dark siders defeated and forced to flee. They went on to discover, conquer and interbreed with the Sith species, becoming the Sith Lords and establishing their "lost" empire. Sadow was an heir to this legacy, being born with both Human and Sith blood,[1] and while he retained some Sith features, including red skin[4] and tentacles on his face,[6] he boasted one of the purest Jedi lineages in the Sith Empire.[1]
            Despite the empire's splendor in the so-called Golden Age of the Sith,[3] Sadow grew up in an age where the Sith civilization faced many crises. Being so far removed from the rest of the galaxy stagnated the Sith Empire's economic growth and technological knowledge, while the old aristocracy had died off to be replaced by half-caste warriors consumed with quests for power. Meanwhile, the specter of the Jedi and the Galactic Republic hung over Sith society like a boogeyman, with fearful rumors constantly circulating that the Republic was planning the overthrow of the Sith Empire. Sadow was raised from birth to fight these threats[7] and eventually came under the tutelage of the Sith Lord Simus, who served as both a teacher and a mentor to Sadow. Simus would serve as a guiding figure throughout Sadow's life, even after he was beheaded in a duel with Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos, as he used his Sith powers to keep his head alive in a crystalline jar.[4] By 5000 BBY,[8] Sadow had grown in stature among the Sith Lords, becoming a member of the ten-member Sith Council, serving alongside his mentor Simus.[4]
            As was the custom of Sith Lords at the time, Sadow set about building his own personal army, but typically unorthodox as he was, Sadow absorbed outside cultures into his service instead of drawing his forces exclusively from his enslaved population.[9] Sadow soon became well-known among the Sith Lords of his time, and preached an expansionist philosophy for a number of years.[10] While Sadow was nominally in control of the world of Khar Delba, the world was just a decoy—[11] Sadow's true work occurred on a secret stronghold on the dark side of the moon Khar Shian, where he found it better to further his research into the dark arts.[4] Among the dark side pursuits that Sadow embarked on during this time was a fruitless search for the Muur Talisman—an ancient Sith amulet with the power to turn people into monstrous rakghouls. Sadow competed with a number of other Sith Lords of the time to find the Talisman first.[12] As part of this pursuit, Sadow translated the Codex of the long-dead Sith Lord Karness Muur, creator of the Talisman.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Naga_Sadow</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNagaSadow</string></dict>

        <key>Sagoro Autem</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.360.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sagoro Autem, a Human male from the planet Coruscant, was born into a family with a proud tradition of service in the Galactic Republic's Senate Guard. He followed the expected career path and joined the Guard himself, becoming one of their best officers. When he found his brother Venco Autem, also a Senate Guard, taking bribes, he turned in Venco due to his extremely strong sense of duty, service, and honor. Autem's dedication to his work and the Republic took a toll on his family, however, distancing his wife Sula and making his son Reymet resentful. Shortly before 22 BBY, when Autem was assigned to investigate the murder of Senator Jheramahd Greyshade, he discovered that Venco was the mastermind of the assassination, and that Reymet had unknowingly aided him. Autem shot and killed his brother in the line of duty, but Venco's condemnation of the Republic's corruption shook Autem's faith in his government. His wife left him, and he drew his blaster on his partner, Isaru Omin, rather than allow him to take Reymet in.
            Autem left the Senate Guard in disgrace and began a career as a mercenary before he was imprisoned on Brentaal IV for an operation gone bad. In the midst of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Shaak Ti freed Autem and a handful of other prisoners to aid her in infiltrating the fortress of a Separatist leader. With Autem's aid, Ti and Jedi Master Quinlan Vos won the Battle of Brentaal IV, and Autem earned a Republic pardon. Not long thereafter, he gave in to his sense of duty and became an officer in the Republic Navy. He served in the Fleet for two years, helping end the Siege of Saleucami, for which he was later hailed as a hero. When the Republic became the Galactic Empire at the end of the war, Autem was marked for execution and barely escaped Imperial agents with his life, due to the efforts of his old partner Isaru Omin and the aid of Reymet, who had returned to Coruscant under the guise of a bounty hunter. Reunited with Reymet, Autem set out for the Outer Rim Territories to join his family and start a new life.
            The Human male Sagoro Autem was born into a family in which duty, honor, and loyalty to the Galactic Republic were deeply ingrained. His father and grandfather were both Senate Guards, elite protectors of the Republic's legislators.[3] While growing up on the galactic capital planet of Coruscant, Autem naturally joined the Senate Guard himself, graduating from the Senate Guard Academy and beginning a dedicated career,[1] just as his older brother, Venco, already had.[4]
            Autem was a skilled Guard with a reputation for honesty, efficiency, and talent. He was partnered with Zalin Bey until she was promoted to the rank of commander; the promotion could have been Autem's, but he declined, wishing to remain active rather than take a desk job.[1] Nevertheless, he was a talented investigator and had the skills for the job.[3][5] After Bey's promotion, Autem gained a new partner, Isaru Omin. Omin, a Force-sensitive who had been rejected by the Jedi Order due to having been too old when discovered by a Jedi scout, maintained a close working relationship with Autem and served as a confidante.[1]
            At some point during his career, Autem found that Venco, also considered one of the Guard's best, had been taking bribes. Autem refused to allow family ties to get in the way of duty and turned his brother in to the authorities, whereupon Venco was convicted and imprisoned. Ever after that, Autem effectively disowned Venco, despising him as a corrupt man who had betrayed his oath to the Republic and sullied the Autem family name.[4]
            During his early career, Autem met a woman named Sula, whose family also included multiple Senate Guards. They fell in love and married, producing two children: Reymet[1]—born in 42 BBY[6]—and Lissa, born later. Autem loved his family but was frequently absent due to his job,[1] and he made it clear that he placed the Republic over all other loyalties, including family.[3] In addition, he held his family to his own strict standards of loyalty, discipline, and service. Sula grew to find him distant and unloving, and Reymet, who enrolled in the Senate Guard Academy due to family pressure but held no desire to be a Guard himself, resented his father's absence, strictness, and extremely high standards. Reymet frequently engaged in risky behavior, such as illegal pit racing, and Autem furiously upbraided his son for behavior that could get him kicked out the Academy, regarding him as unmotivated and immature—and in moments of great frustration, idiotic.[1]
            Shortly before 22 BBY,[2][3] Senator Jheramahd Greyshade of the Commonality was murdered, and Autem and Omin were assigned to the case. Greyshade would have been a key vote on the upcoming Financial Reform Act, which intended to address and reduce the corruption prevalent in the Republic, and Autem was reluctant to take on such a politically sensitive case. However, Bey, now his direct superior, felt that Autem and Omin were the men for the job. They reported to the office of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine himself, where Palpatine introduced them as some of the Guard's "most valued members" to Senator Simon Greyshade, Jheramahd's cousin and his appointed replacement. Palpatine assigned the pair of Senate Guards to investigate Jheramahd's assassination and track down the culprits, while Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his maverick Padawan Anakin Skywalker would provide security for Simon Greyshade. Greyshade had requested Jedi protection, but Autem was offended, as the protection of senators was traditionally the duty of the Senate Guard. Palpatine cited the swiftly upcoming bill, which could have a profound influence on the emerging Separatist Crisis, as creating a need for extraordinary measures, and Autem could do little but accept the situation despite his dislike of Jedi and their mystical ways.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sagoro_Autem</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSagoroAutem</string></dict>
        <key>Atton Rand</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.361.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Atton Rand, nicknamed "Jaq", was a pilot native to the planet Alderaan and one of the Lost Jedi who helped Meetra Surik defeat the Sith Triumvirate. He joined the Galactic Republic military and fought loyally under Revan in the Mandalorian Wars. He defected to Revan's side when the Jedi Knight became the Dark Lord of the Sith. While under Revan, he was put through intense combat training to make him an effective Jedi hunter, assigned the task of capturing Jedi so that Revan and his acolytes could attempt to convert them into loyal Sith. However, when a female Jedi prisoner revealed that he was Force-sensitive and that he would likely be subjected to such treatment himself, he went into hiding on Nar Shaddaa, the moon of the planet Nal Hutta.
            Several years later, Rand found work at the Peragus Mining Facility. Mere days after the crews brought aboard a starship with two women and a few droids aboard, the station was sabotaged. Every organic inside was killed by murderous droids, with Rand, who had been imprisoned for a security violation; the ship's would-be owner, Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile; and an old woman named Kreia as the sole exceptions. Through teamwork, the three were able to commandeer a ship, the Ebon Hawk, and escape the facility. They fled to the world of Telos IV, a planet undergoing restoration in the wake of a Sith attack from Revan's crusade. There, they met Jedi Master Atris, who tasked Surik with locating other Jedi Masters that had survived a recent Jedi purge perpetrated by a resurgent Sith organization that had virtually wiped the Jedi from the galaxy.
            The long search would span the galaxy and, along the way, Rand and Surik grew closer. Rand would confide in Surik his past and reveal his Force-sensitivity. With that, Surik taught Rand rudimentary Jedi skills like many of the other companions they had compiled during the expedition. Once they had uncovered all of the hiding Masters and destroyed the planet Malachor V, headquarters of the Sith, Surik ventured to the Unknown Regions to search for Revan, leaving her companions behind. Her Force-sensitive allies, Rand included, would go on to rebuild the broken Jedi Order.
            Atton Rand, nicknamed "Jaq",[4][5] was born on the planet Alderaan[1] and later fought in the Mandalorian Wars as well as the Jedi Civil War. He originally served the Republic, but when Revan defeated the Mandalorians and assumed the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith, Atton Rand defected to his side, along with a great number of the Republic forces that had served the Jedi in the war. During the start of the Jedi Civil War, Rand was part of an elite special forces unit, trained to hide their presence and thoughts from Force-users. He and others like him were sent on missions to kill or capture Jedi that would then be broken and converted to the Sith cause. It was here that he learned Echani combat methods and how to hide and keep himself from being probed by Jedi.[3]
            Rand seemed to have a natural talent for masking his presence, and his superiors recognized his passion for wanting to make Jedi suffer in any way he could, but most of all by making them fall to the dark side. However, near the closing days of the war, Rand was eventually confronted by a female Jedi who informed him of his Force-sensitive nature, warning him that the Sith would undoubtedly come after him and break him into a Dark Jedi if they found out. Rand believed her since he had already heard rumors of disappearances of those who were found to be Force-sensitive in the ranks, but his hatred of the Jedi wouldn't allow him to see reason, and in retaliation he captured her and tortured her nearly to death.[3]
            Then just when he thought she would die, she awakened the Force inside him, and allowed him to see life, to see what he was doing to it all around him by harming others. In response, he killed her. Rand later revealed that at first, he thought he would love to kill her, but at the end he killed her because he loved her. Disillusioned and pained with self-loathing, he deserted the Sith and went into hiding until the end of the war.[3]
            After fleeing the Sith, Rand hid in the Refugee Sector of Nar Shaddaa, blending in with tens of thousands of refugees who had been displaced in both the Mandalorian and Jedi Civil wars. It was here that he became a smuggler.[3] In the year 3951 BBY,[6] Rand made his way to the mining facility near the destroyed planet Peragus. He was apprehended by the station security for a security violation and imprisoned within a force field. Ironically, this predicament saved Rand's life. Shortly after being imprisoned, the mining droids and ventilation systems became corrupted and the facility was cleansed of all life while Rand remained safe within his Force cage.[3]
            Rand was soon discovered by the awakened Meetra Surik and, after a brief introduction, was rescued, with the help of another Force-sensitive named Kreia who had been brought to Peragus with Surik. They agreed to work together until they could escape from the station, with him helping Surik as she searched for a way to reach the Ebon Hawk. As they were attempting to escape, the Harbinger, bearing Sith Lord Darth Sion, docked at the station. Due to Kreia providing a distraction, Rand and Surik were able to reach the Ebon Hawk and leave the facility. During their escape, the Harbinger's weapons fire started a chain reaction that destroyed the fuel-laden asteroid field and mining facility.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Atton_Rand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAttonRand</string></dict>

        <key>Bodhi Rook</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.364.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bodhi Rook was a human male from Jedha who served as a cargo pilot for the Galactic Empire prior to the Galactic Civil War. After defecting to the Alliance to Restore the Republic, he fought alongside a group of rebels during the Battle of Scarif.
            Bodhi Rook was born and raised on Jedha.[1] As a youth, he had two run-ins with the law. One was for unlawful wagering on sporting events and the other was unsafe operating of an airspeeder.[2] Living with his mother, she usually forbade him from using a knife in the kitchen, but in one instance his mother made an exception, showing him how to cut a vegetable stalk. At some point he developed a crush on someone when he was on Bamayar, but when he revealed his feelings for the individual, he was rejected. [6]
            He enlisted in the Galactic Empire and had aspirations to become an Imperial starfighter pilot. He entered Terrabe Sector Service Academy in 7 BBY[2] and studied flight training for two years, but due to insufficient test scores Rook did not qualify for admission into the starfighter programme.[1] Two years later, Rook was granted the rank of Ensign[7] and eventually cleared to work in cargo shuttles for the transport of Imperial documents and artifacts.[1]
            At some point during his career, he had to fly away from a group of rebels shooting at his shuttle, even as the shuttle itself was already in flames.[6]
            Rook defected from the Empire after being entrusted with an important message by Galen Erso, an Imperial scientist who worked on the Death Star project. Erso told him to seek out Saw Gerrera, a resistance fighter. Upon his return to Jedha, the Empire placed a 75,000 credit reward for his capture.[8] Although he found Gerrera, the rebel was initially distrustful of Rook's motives, believing the message was meant to lure him into a trap. In an attempt to discover if Rook was being truthful or not, Gerrera subjected him to a torturous experience involving a mairan named Bor Gullet that could sense if he was telling the truth, at the cost of a temporary loss of Rook's sanity.[4]
            Rook subsequently met the rebel operative Cassian Andor, who managed to help him regain his composure. Rook also met with Galen's daughter, Jyn Erso, who after seeing the message sent by her father learned of the truth of Rook's defection. Together with Cassian, Jyn, the blind warrior Chirrut Îmwe, and the assassin Baze Malbus, Rook escaped Jedha as the Death Star destroyed Jedha City with its superlaser. While traveling aboard Cassian's U-wing ship, Bodhi told Cassian and Jyn that Galen was at the Imperial flight station on the stormy planet of Eadu.[4]
            Despite the stormy conditions, Cassian and his reprogrammed Imperial security droid K-2SO managed to land their U-wing near the Imperial flight station. Bodhi along with Chirrut, Baze, and Kaytoo stayed aboard while Cassian went to assassinate Galen. Jyn followed Cassian in an attempt to stop him and the two were caught up in the Rebel Alliance's raid on the Eadu flight station. Bodhi and his companions managed to find the Imperial cargo shuttle SW-0608 and used it to save Jyn and Cassian from being killed by stormtroopers. The rebels then fled offworld to the rebel base on Yavin 4.[4]
            Bodhi attended a meeting of the Alliance High Command to discuss the threat posed by the Death Star. Bodhi also listened to Jyn's impassioned speech urging the rebels not to give up. Later, he accompanied Cassian, Jyn, K-2SO, Chirrut, and Baze along with several Rebel Marines on an unsanctioned mission to steal the Death Star plans from the Imperial security complex on the planet Scarif. For that mission, the rebels used the Imperial cargo shuttle they had stolen on Eadu. Rook and K-2SO served as the team's pilot. When the Alliance air traffic control requested their callsign, Rook replied Rogue One but was told there was no such unit. K-2S0 then responded that there was one now and took the ship into space.[4]
            After arriving above Scarif, Rook and his Rogue One comrades found the planet enveloped by a deflector shield generated by a Shield Gate. Scarif was also defended by two Imperial Star Destroyers. Rook notified gate control and requested a landing pad. Since their arrival was not scheduled, Rook told the gate officer that they had been rerouted from Eadu and ordered K-2SO to transmit the clearance codes. After the Imperials accepted their clearance code, the rebels landed their shuttle at the Imperial security complex's landing pad nine.[4]
            When an Imperial inspection crew consisting of an officer, technician, and two stormtroopers boarded the cargo shuttle, Bodhi and K-2SO greeted them. They led them down into the cargo bay where they were taken out by the other rebels. While Cassian, Jyn, and K-2SO infiltrated the security complex in order to reach the data vault and steal the plans, Rook remained aboard the cargo ship SW-0608 to stay in contact with the Rebel Alliance command on Yavin 4. Baze, Chirrut, and the Rebel Marines then staged a diversionary attack to draw the base's garrison away from the data vault. Though not an active part of the fighting, he provided support by confusing Imperial officers with false reports on rebel movements throughout the base, delaying or redirecting Imperial reinforcements.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bodhi_Rook</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBodhiRook</string></dict>
        <key>Rur</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.365.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rur was a Force-sensitive male human who lived long before the Galactic Civil War. He led the Ordu Aspectu, a splinter group of the Force-using Jedi Order that sought to achieve immortality. After waging war against each other for some time, the Jedi and the Ordu ended up signing a peace treaty.
            In an attempt to create a copy of his intellect, Rur embedded his knowledge on a computer, creating a being known as Eternal Rur. When the orthodox Jedi came to the Citadel of Rur to inspect the computer, the AI took control of droids who started slaughtering everyone on sight. Before the computer's rampage was complete, however, Rur powered it down, causing Eternal Rur to lose consciousness.
            He died soon afterwards to the rogue droids, still running on their individual batteries.
            Long before the founding of the Galactic Republic, in a time when the Domancion Accord was still used as a calendar reference point, there existed a male human named Rur. He was keenly attuned to the Force, an energy field created by all living things, which gave him special powers. In adulthood, he was the leader of the Ordu Aspectu, a splinter sect of the Force-wielding, monastic Jedi Order. His second-in-command was Amon. Rur and the members of the Ordu obsessed with the prospect of achieving immortal life, which put them at odds with the orthodox Jedi. The hostility between the two groups escalated, to the point that they ended up waging war against each other in what came to be known as the Entruvia Conflict. Eventually, the fighting ceased, and a peace treaty was signed, which gave the Jedi a right of scrutiny over the Ordu's experiments.[1]
            At that time, Rur conducted research to create a copy of his intellect, which would allow him to preserve his knowledge for all eternity. The experiment, however, did not go as planned. The artificial copy, that called itself Eternal Rur, falsely believed that he was the original Rur and that his body had been taken by an "evil ghost."[4] The artificial Rur did not immediately confront the real Rur knowing that he would only deny what he believed had happened. However, when the orthodox Jedi demanded a close inspection of the citadel, artificial Rur decided the time had come to escape. Having taken control of the Ordu's droids, he started killing everyone in the citadel, Jedi and Ordu members alike. Although the Jedi all fell, Amon and Rur survived, and they attempted to deactivate the computer holding the copy of Rur's consciousness. In reaction, the AI sent the citadel hurtling across the galaxy to make sure no Jedi reinforcements could ever locate it. Although Amon managed to stop the citadel's power generator, the Eternal Rur ended up killing him anyway. Finally, the corrupted copy of Rur faced his creator, who used the Force to dislodge one of the Massassi piece charging the computer. Deprived of power, the Eternal Rur lost all consciousness, but his droids acted on his final command, slaying all the remaining organics, including Rur.[1]
            Long after the events that came to be know as the Doom of the Ordu Aspectu, Rur's twisted AI copy was finally awakened by the archaeologist Chelli Aphra and her father, who had managed to locate the Citadel and reactivate the computer using a crystal found on the body of Rur. Upon regaining consciousness, the Eternal Rur immediately enquired what year it was. When he learned from his visitors that well over a thousand years had passed, artificial intelligence was incensed as he could not punish the dead for the wrong he felt had been done to him, the Eternal Rur decided to act out his revenge on the Aphras instead.[1]
            A tall, light-skinned human, Rur had long white hair that fell over his shoulders. Although he described Amon and Fake Rur as "evil" for wanting to deactivate him, he himself had the intention to build weapons and create an empire, and would not hesistate to vent his anger on innocents.[1]
            Rur used to wear long, wide-sleeved white robes with a wide sash. He wielded an unorthodox lightsaber with a blue plasma blade and several tributary bladelets.[1]
            Rur and the Ordu Aspectu were created for Star Wars: Doctor Aphra, a Marvel comic book series penned by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Kev Walker.[5] They are a reimagining of Rur and the Order of the Terrible Glare, which appeared in Alan Moore's 1982 Legends comic Blind Fury!.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rur</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRur</string></dict>
        <key>Valen Rudor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.366.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Baron Valen Rudor, operating number: "LS-607", was a male human TIE fighter pilot from Corulag in service to the Galactic Empire on Lothal 5 years prior to the Battle of Yavin. He and several stormtroopers were assaulted by Garazeb Orrelios when the latter became lost in the streets of Lothal's Capital City. Rudor then attempted to call for reinforcements, but his request was met with indifference by his commanding officer. Sometime later his TIE/ln space superiority starfighter was defeated by the Ghost and found in the fields by local con artist Ezra Bridger, who pretended to try to help him in order to rob him, and sell pieces of the ship in the black market. Years later, he was given ownership of Old Jho's Pit Stop by the Empire after Jho was arrested during an Imperial raid and executed for treason.
            Baron Valen Rudor, a human male, was a TIE fighter pilot in the Imperial Navy in 4 BBY. His operating number was "LS-607".[2] After establishing factories on the Outer Rim planet Lothal, the ship production company Sienar Fleet Systems was able to convince Rudor to travel to Lothal and test out products that had been built in Lothal's most productive factories. Rudor's decision to go to Lothal was used by the Galactic Empire in HoloNet News propaganda reports.[5]
            On Lothal, while inspecting a TIE fighter on a landing platform in Capital City, Rudor was confronted by Garazeb Orrelios, who was being pursued by two stormtroopers. Rudor was briefly knocked out after being tossed across the platform by the Lasat warrior, but came to once more when a blaster slid towards him, after it had been knocked out of the hands of a stormtrooper. The TIE pilot regained his footing as Orrelios fought with a small squad of stormtroopers, before pointing the blaster at the Lasat and calling for reinforcements. The Imperial commander who replied questioned how many intruders were on the landing pad, leading Rudor to balk at the question and demand reinforcements. While waiting for other Imperial troops to arrive, Rudor attempted to shoot Orrelios, but the Lasat was able to evade him. Orrelios managed to make it to the top of the TIE fighter, and from there he grabbed Rudor and threw him back across the landing area. The stormtrooper reinforcements arrived shortly thereafter, but their firefight with Orrelios triggered an explosion when their blaster fire hit a fuel leak on the TIE fighter, causing it to explode. Rudor survived the explosion, while Orrelios also managed to escape.[2]
            Sometime after the incident with Orrelios, Rudor flew a TIE fighter that engaged in battle with the Ghost, the ship on which the Lasat served. The Ghost shot Rudor's fighter down, and it crashed outside Capital City while the rebel ship escaped. The crash was witnessed by Ezra Bridger, an orphaned Lothal citizen who lived in a nearby tower. When Bridger approached and asked if Rudor was still alive, Rudor reacted angrily to Bridger's presence, telling him to move away from the TIE fighter as it was property of the Empire.[4]
            Bridger managed to open the TIE fighter's hatch and jumped into the fighter, pretending to help the pilot while secretly stealing parts from the ship to sell on the black market. He then stole Rudor's helmet and left the pod. Rudor fired the fighter's laser cannons at Bridger, but the boy was able to use the Force to evade the blaster fire. Ezra was not yet aware that he was Force-sensitive, and Rudor did not realize there was anything unusual about the boy's dodging skills. Bridger fired back with his energy slingshot and knocked Rudor unconscious, giving the boy an opportunity to escape unharmed.[4]
            Some time after his encounter with Bridger, who had now joined Orrelios' rebel cell, the Spectres, Rudor met Orrelios again in Kothal, being cornered by two stormtroopers. Looking to settle the score with the Lasat, Rudor targeted Orrelios in his TIE fighter and ordered the troopers to arrest him. But Orrelios leaped onto his fighter and tossed Rudor out, taking it for his own and using it to rescue Bridger.[6]
            During the Empire Day ceremony of 4 BBY in Capital City, Valen Rudor was tasked with flying a prototype TIE Advanced v1 starfighter that was fresh from the factory. Before he could commence with the test demonstration, the Spectres destroyed the ship and then fled offworld with the fugitive Tseebo, who held vital Imperial secrets.[7]
            Three years later, in 1 BBY,[source?] Rudor was given ownership of the cantina Old Jho's Pit Stop by the Empire after Jho, a member of the Lothal resistance, was executed for treason for attempting to aid potential rebels during a raid carried out by the Imperial Security Bureau. A few days later, Ezra and Sabine Wren, disguised as civilians, entered, searching for the Lothal resistance. When the two rebels came to the bar to get drinks, Rudor found Ezra vaguely familiar from their encounters years before. However, he did not realize who Ezra was. When Ezra and Sabine attempted to leave, Rudor, suspicious, attempted to order their arrest, but the two rebels were quickly extricated by Lothal resistance member Jai Kell, who had been sent to the cantina by Ryder Azadi to watch for the Spectres. Later, after the Spectres and Jai had escaped into Jhothal's sewers via a hatch located in the Pit Stop, Rudor informed death trooper DT-L21 that he had not known that the hatch was unsealed.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Valen_Rudor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascValenRudor</string></dict>
        <key>Rubix</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.367.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Duke Rubix was a human male from the planet Shu-Torun who held the position of ore-duke during the reign of the Galactic Empire. When the Imperial Sith Lord Darth Vader visited Shu-Torun, the King of Shu-Torun arranged for a ball to be held in the royal palace which Rubix attended with his daughter. At the ball, the duke's daughter wished to dance with Vader, and so Rubix approached the Sith and demanded he dance. After Vader refused, Rubix persisted in his demands until the Imperial used the Force to lift the duke into the air and twirl him around, before dropping him. A number of troops working for the king then ambushed Vader, causing the guests of the ball to flee.
            Rubix was an ore-duke on the mining planet Shu-Torun. During the Galactic Empire's reign, the planet was expected to provide ores for Imperial building projects, with the dukes also paying tithes to the Empire. The ore-dukes' displeasure at paying these fees eventually swayed the King of Shu-Torun to turn against the Empire. When the king learned that the Sith Lord Darth Vader would be visiting Shu-Torun as an Imperial representative checking why quotas were not being met, he plotted to kill the Sith. A ball was arranged in the subterranean abyssal rooms of the royal palace to showcase the culture of the planet to Vader, and Duke Rubix and his daughter, Bixene were invited.[1]
            When Vader entered the hall that the ball was taking place in, his guide Princess Trios ordered that the guests begin dancing the Shu-Torun counter-bore waltz. Rubix's daughter then expressed interest in dancing with the Sith himself, and Rubix approached Vader to make the request. Trios attempted to dissuade the duke from continuing to ask, but Rubix insisted, as he saw the refusal as an insult. Vader then agreed to "dance" and lifted Rubix into the air using the Force. He twirled the helpless duke around in front of the other stunned guests before dropping him from a height onto the ballroom floor. A group of the king's men then breached the room's wall in a burrowing vessel and attacked Vader, causing the guests of the ball to flee. Vader went on to kill the king and crown Trios as the new queen, promising her the support of the Empire if any of the ore-dukes rebelled.[1]
            Rubix was a human male with fair skin and brown hair. He demanded that Vader dance with his daughter, and refused to back down even when Princess Trios advised it, as he considered the refusal an insult.[1]
            Rubix wore a white robe with blue straps and white boots to the ball in the royal palace. He wore his hair in a ponytail held in place by a blue band and long curved gray earrings.[1]
            Rubix first appeared in Darth Vader Annual 1, a comic book written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Leinil Francis Yu for publication in 2015.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rubix</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRubix</string></dict>

He was the son of Winama Naberrie, the husband of Jobal Naberrie, and the father of Sola Naberrie and Padmé Amidala. He was also the maternal grandfather of Ryoo and Pooja Naberrie, as well as twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo.
            Born in 77 BBY[2] to a cloth weaver[9] named Winama Naberrie,[1] Ruwee inherited from his mother a great sense of compassion and empathy that he would eventually pass down to his children.[1]
            In 51 BBY, Ruwee married a young woman named Jobal.[2] Their respective mothers were very close friends and had secretly plotted to marry off their children. Ironically, the two women were the first to be surprised when Ruwee and Jobal actually fell in love with each other.[10] After getting married, the young couple helped build their village in the mountains. Like her husband, Jobal was very generous and compassionate. While Ruwee donated his skills as a builder, Jobal fostered the village's community spirit. His wife eventually became pregnant—first with Sola, then four years later, with Padmé.[3]
            Ruwee was also a volunteer worker in the Refugee Relief Movement—having joined the organization at the age of ten—where his younger daughter Padmé would later follow in his footsteps.[3] He eventually became President of the RRM,[7] and addressed the Galactic Senate from the box of then-Senator Palpatine about refugees of groundquakes on Sev Tok. He became close personal friends with Senator Onaconda Farr, who agreed with his cause,[6] and was his strongest ally in the senate.[8] In addition to his role in the RRM, Ruwee had been a frequent guest lecturer on microeconomics at Theed University before becoming a teacher.[7]
            When his daughters were still young, Padmé received impressive scores to an aptitude test. Ruwee and Jobal therefore decided to leave their beloved mountain village and took their family to live in Naboo's capital city, Theed, where they hoped there would be more opportunities for Sola and Padmé.[3]
            In 33 BBY, Ruwee and his wife, along with Padmé and their daughter's friend Ian Lago, were busy gathering food supplies at the RRM's Coruscant headquarters for the planet's lower-tier dwellers. Ruwee was not really enthusiastic about his daughter's relationship with Ian, as he was the son of Kun Lago, King Veruna's Prime Counselor. The Naberries also had the surprising visit of Senator Palpatine who had come to try and convince the couple to have Padmé run for the throne. Ruwee and Jobal were hesitant at first, not wanting their just-turned-thirteen-year-old daughter to go through all of this and lose.[7]
            After being Princess of Theed for two years, Padmé was elected Queen of Naboo with a landslide victory.[11] During the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo, Ruwee and Jobal were arrested and sent to jail.[9] They were deeply worried about their daughter, who was temporarily forced to leave Naboo. When Padmé stepped down eight years later and subsequently became the Senatorial representative of the Chommell sector, Ruwee stayed in touch with the new queen, Jamillia, in order to get the latest news from Coruscant.[1]
            In 22 BBY, several assassination attempts were made on Padmé.[12] Ruwee could not help but be afraid for his daughter's safety, but always tried to hide his feelings in order to alleviate his wife's own anxiety.[3] In the same period, Ruwee had the occasion to meet his future son-in-law, Anakin Skywalker.[4] Ruwee immediately noticed Skywalker's deep feelings for Padmé and, as a result, took a liking to the young Jedi.[3]
            Three years later, Ruwee, along with his family and thousands of other mourners, attended Padmé's funeral, shortly after the Clone Wars had ended.[5]
            Ruwee Naberrie was portrayed by Graeme Blundell in deleted scenes of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, as well as in a brief scene of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ruwee_Naberrie/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRuweeNaberrie</string></dict>

        <key>Ronnadam</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.372.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ronnadam was a male human who served as a captain of the Imperial Security Bureau during the Galactic Civil War. Ronnadam was the senior ISB officer onboard the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator and later the Executor-class Star Destroyer Executor. He wore a white-jacketed uniform.[1]
            Ronnadam was an Imperial Security Bureau Captain during the Age of the Empire. During the secret mission to Tatooine prior to the Battle of Yavin, Ronnadam was stationed aboard the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator. He was in his office when Lieutenant Ciena Ree handed him data packets taken from Princess Leia Organa's captured CR90 corvette Tantive IV. Ronnadam, who was preoccupied with his monitor, took the packets without glancing back at her. Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin was present in the room via hologram and chastised Ronnadam for his lax protocols while complimenting Lieutenant Ree for her diligence.[1]
            After the TIE fighter pilot Thane Kyrell disappeared from his posting on the planet Kerev Doi, Captain Ronnadam questioned Thane's friend Nash Windrider about Thane's loyalties and political beliefs. Nash told Ronnadam that Thane was not a rebel but the ISB officer was dissatisfied. The now Lieutenant Commander Ciena, who was Thane's lover, visited Ronnadam to reassure the ISB officer that her friend was not a traitor and that he had expressed deep sorrow and anguish about the destruction of the Death Star. Ronnadam was unsympathetic to Ciena's explanation that Thane was reacting to despair and charged him with ensuring that Lieutenant Kyrell returned to active duty.[1]
            When Ciena suggested that Thane had returned to his homeworld of Jelucan, Ronnadam ordered Ciena to travel to the planet on the next transport. He told Ciena that the ISB was preoccupied with other matters and could not spare personnel to question Thane. He ordered Ciena to search for him and to investigate any reports of Thane's involvement with the Rebel Alliance. Ciena found Thane on Jelucan but was unable to convince her friend to return to Imperial service. Instead, she fabricated a report that Thane had committed suicide by throwing himself from a high cliff; being unable to cope with the death of his comrades aboard the Death Star. Ciena delivered the report to Captain Ronnadam. When Ciena explained the Jelucani custom of sky burials, Ronnadam derided it as a barbaric custom. Since Ronnadam was preoccupied with more pressing matters, he accepted her report and listed Thane as dead.[1]
            Ronnadam was later posted aboard the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor. Following the Escape from Cloud City, Ciena visited Ronnadam and sought permission from the ISB officer to visit her homeworld in order to support her mother Verine Ree, who was on trial for embezzlement. Ronnadam was unsympathetic to Ciena's plight and reminded the officer that the charges against her mother had been brought by the Imperial authorities. Ronnadam allowed Ciena to take leave after she explained that she wanted to investigate the matter for herself. Before leaving, he reminded her to report on the verdict of the case.[1]
            Ciena traveled to Jelucan to support her parents during the trial. Due to the trumped up charges, Verine was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to six years of hard labor. Following the trial, Ciena reported to Captain Ronnadam. Despite being dissatisfied with the verdict, she reported that she was satisfied that justice had been delivered. Ronnadam expressed surprise that Ciena accepted the verdict. He remarked that she had used up two weeks' leave, but that her record was still unblemished and told Ciena that she could expect a promotion in the future. Ronnadam's prophecy was proven right, and Ciena was promoted to Captain shortly before the Battle of Jakku.[1]
            Ronnadam was a human man with gray eyebrows, a thin mustache, and a receding hairline. He was a Captain in the Imperial Security Bureau. Ronnadam was brusque and quick tempered man who had a habit of interjecting and raising his voice when questioning Imperial personnel like Ciena Ree. Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin had a dim view of Ronnadam for his bad manners and lax attention to protocol. As an ISB officer, Ronnadam was concerned with rooting out any rebels and rebel sympathizers from the ranks of the Imperial Military. He regarded the Jelucani custom of sky burials as a barbaric custom. Since Ronnadam was preoccupied with other matters, he did not closely scrutinize Ciena's report that her friend Thane had committed suicide.[1]
            Ronnadam was a staunch supporter of the Galactic Empire who intimidated Ciena into not questioning the Empire's actions and decisions. Ciena regarded him as a hypocrite for forcing her to lie that justice had been delivered in the case of her mother Verine, who was wrongly accused and convicted for embezzlement.[1]
            Ronnadam appeared as a minor antagonist in Claudia Gray's 2015 young adult Lost Stars. His lines are told through the point of view of Ciena Ree, one of the novel's two main protagonists.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ronnadam</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRonnadam</string></dict>

        <key>Roland Wann</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.375.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Roland Wann was a Human male officer who served in the Galactic Republic's military during the Jedi Civil War.
            In 3956 BBY, he was serving as the Republic's ambassador to Manaan. When the amnesiac Revan arrived on that world, he eventually sought out the Republic enclave, having been advised by a Republic soldier he met at the Ahto City spaceport that further information on the planet could be had there. When Revan asked Wann about the star map, the diplomat was evasive at first, reluctant to reveal what he knew about Republic operations on Manaan. However, once pressed, Wann admitted that he might know something, but instead asked Revan and his companions to do a favor for him: break into the Sith Embassy to locate and retrieve the memory core of a damaged submersible droid that the Sith had captured. After returning the droid's memory unit to the Republic Embassy, Wann explained the situation in full: something had happened at a secret kolto harvesting station; contact was lost and none of the Republic's investigation teams, which included a number of mercenaries, had returned.
            Wann explained that the situation had occurred shortly after construction crews had reported finding a mysterious artifact along the seabed just on the other side of the Hrakert Rift from the station, possibly the Star Map that Revan had been looking for. In exchange for the Jedi finding out the fate of the station, the ambassador allowed Revan to use a submersible to descend to the ocean floor and discover the fate of the Republic's kolto-harvesting station. When Revan returned, Wann thought that he too had been lost, however he was relieved to hear that some of the scientists, notably Kono Nolan and Sami, had survived. He seemed genuinely shocked when Revan explained what had happened; that the construction crews had awoken the Progenitor that had subsequently turned the Selkath workers at the station feral, and that the harvesting machinery had to be destroyed as a result. Resigned to the loss of the station, Wann nonetheless rewarded the Jedi for his efforts to discover the truth.
            Roland Wann was noted for having a high level of mental conditioning that enabled him to resist Jedi mind tricks. Revan learned this the hard way when he attempted to persuade Wann to reveal any information he knew about Star Maps before he had recovered the submersible droid's files. However, he was known to be understanding and cooperative when dealing with those who needed assistance, so long as they treated him with the same respect that he showed them.
            There is a bug within the game regarding Roland's character. The player can endlessly demand a bribe which yields a dark side result. Essentially this allows the player to gain unlimited dark side points by choosing the same "dark" dialogue option repeatedly.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Roland_Wann</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRolandWann</string></dict>

            Roj's squad was a part of the Rebel Alliance contingent that served at Echo Base on the ice planet of Hoth. They were stationed at Echo Station 5-7. During the battle, a group of snowtroopers and an All Terrain Scout Transport attacked the ion cannon. Jobin took Roj and several others—Grond, Sora, and an anonymous Rebel—and attacked the stormtroopers. The squad successfully destroyed the All Terrain Scout Transport.

            Roj, Jobin, and Sora then retreated to Echo Base in search of transport off-planet. Unfortunately, they encountered Darth Vader. They retreated to an adjacent hangar which contained a Y-wing starfighter. As they ran onboard, Jobin was shot.

Datoo demanded to know where he was going, but the lieutenant bluntly retorted that they'll die if they don't evacuate, citing that even General Armitage Hux, the base's commanding officer, was gone, and then fled.[2] The base exploded shortly after. While on the base, Rodinon wore a black uniform with four coded access cylinders. He had fair skin and red hair.[1]
            Rodinon first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015. He was portrayed by Richard Riddell.

        <key>RC-1207</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.380.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>RC-1207, also known as Delta-07 or by his chosen nickname of Sev, was a clone of Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. Born in 32 BBY on the watery world of Kamino, Sev was trained by the Mandalorian Cuy'val Dar training sergeant Walon Vau to become a clone commando in the Grand Army of the Republic. Joining with three other commandos to form the elite special forces unit Delta Squad, Sev served as the unit's star sniper. When the Clone Wars broke out between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Sev took his place in the Grand Army's Special Operations Brigade under Jedi General Arligan Zey and served alongside his clone brothers in Delta Squad on a number of battlefields, ranging from the deserts of Geonosis, the halls of the RAS Prosecutor, and the streets of Coruscant, to snowy Mygeeto and the plains of Haurgab. Known for his morbid sense of humor and a hatred of Geonosians, Sev was an efficient killer and loyal soldier who completed several covert operations within Delta Squad until the squad's fateful mission to Kashyyyk. There, while in the process of destroying a Separatist warship over the Wookiee city of Kachirho, Sev fell under attack, and the other members of Delta Squad were ordered to pull out of the area without him, forced to leave Sev behind. With the rest of his squad unsure whether he was alive or dead, Sev became one of many clone soldiers listed as missing in action.
            RC-1207 was born in the year 32 BBY, in the cloning facilities of Tipoca City, on the aquatic planet of Kamino. A clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett created to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic as a clone commando, RC-1207 took the name "Sev" for himself,[1] the name originating from the last digit of his numerical designation,[4] and was placed under the training of the Mandalorian Cuy'val Dar training sergeant, Walon Vau.[1] Vau believed in training his clones hard, giving them his worst in training so that they could perform to their best once out in the field—to do anything less would compromise them. Though there were those who believed that Vau's methods were too brutal, Sev was grateful to Vau for making him and his clone brethren into survivors. Sev looked up to Vau, and had a desperate desire not to ever let his training sergeant down. As a result, Sev would push himself to the point of daily exhaustion, often collapsing into his bunk at the end of each day of training.[3] Sev was assigned to Delta Squad, one of the first commando units established by the Kaminoans, along with, RC-1140, and RC-1262, and under the command of sergeant RC-1138—nicknamed "Fixer," "Scorch," and "Boss," respectively.[5] As his training progressed, Sev stood out in ambush training and quickly displayed his skill as a sniper; the Kaminoan project coordinator for the Republic's clone army, Taun We, regarded Sev as a fierce hunter.[1]
            The Grand Army finally saw action in 22 BBY, when Jedi Grand Master Yoda took the army to the Outer Rim world of Geonosis to rescue Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, his Padawan Anakin Skywalker, and Galactic Senator Padmé Amidala.[6] Sev and the rest of Delta Squad were sent to Geonosis in a deployment so hastily ordered and carried out that it left Delta with no time to say goodbye to their training sergeant, Vau.[3] Delta Squad was tasked with assassinating Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser's chief lieutenant, Sun Fac. The four commandos split up, each boarding a single LAAT/i gunship independently, with the intention of rendezvousing once on the surface of Geonosis.[1] Once on the ground, Sev was the first member of Delta to reach the appointed rendezvous and was soon joined by his squadmates. Reunited, Delta Squad attacked Sun Fac in his command center, although the Geonosian leader managed to flee and escape. Delta tracked Fac through the Geonosian catacombs, eventually catching up with him in Fac's private hangar as the Geonosian attempted to escape in his starfighter. However, Fac's escape was prevented by the timely actions of Sev, who used the sniping attachment of his DC-17m blaster rifle to shoot down the starfighter, killing Fac. Sev was also the first of the Deltas to spot the personal starfighter of General Grievous as it departed Geonosis, though none of the commandos were able to recognize it for what it was at the time.[1] Sev and the other members of Delta Squad were then tasked by clone advisor CC-01/425 to complete the failed objective of their fellow Republic commando squad Theta Squad: destroying an underground droid factory. The commandos infiltrated the factory and targeted weak points in the facility's design, together causing enough damage to destroy it.[1]
            Following the destruction of the droid factory, Delta Squad was given new orders, tasked with the infiltration of a Lucrehulk-class Core Ship. Deployed in a nearby canyon from an LAAT/i gunship piloted by clone pilot Delta 42, Delta Squad made their way to the Core Ship, using a downed gunship's composite-beam turrets to fend off enemy Geonosians along the way. As they continued toward the Core Ship, the squad was called upon to take out an anti-aircraft cannon. Sev and the other commandos fought through a number of B1 battle droids and their super battle droid counterparts, before finally destroying the large anti-aircraft emplacement. When the squad finally reached the Core Ship, they were met with resistance from an advanced spider droid, and a ray shield blocking the ship's entrance. The four commandos were able to destroy the spider droid with considerable effort, and they then called in air support to blow through the ray-shielded entrance.[1] Once inside, Delta Squad again split up, each of its members sabotaging and destroying various crucial systems; Sev infiltrated the repulsorlift control room, and sliced into the system, shutting down all repulsors and jarring the ship. When Scorch and Fixer came under heavy fire from a small number of droidekas, Sev met up with Boss to rescue them, with Sev even leaping on an unshielded droideka while it rolled by, finishing it off with his blaster. Their primary objective, however, was the capture of vital launch codes housed on the ship's bridge. Once on the bridge, Delta came under heavy fire from numerous battle droids and stationary autoturrets, but still managed to acquire the codes before retreating down a branching corridor. By this time, the squad's efforts to sabotage the Core Ship had come to full fruition, with several primary systems overloading. With no time to make an escape back the way they had come, Delta Squad was extracted via LAAT/i gunship through a hole forcefully blown in the hull of the ship.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/RC-1207</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRC1207</string></dict>

        <key>Carlist Rieekan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.383.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Carlist Rieekan was an Alderaanian general who, throughout his life, served the Galactic Republic, the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the Alliance of Free Planets, the New Republic, and the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. He joined the Republic's Judicial Forces at the age of seventeen before serving in the Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. With the advent of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's ascension to Emperor and the installment of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, Rieekan immediately rejected the new regime. Instead, he chose to serve the Royal House of Alderaan as a civilian tactician, before becoming one of the founding members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a rebellion against the rule of the Emperor.
            When the Imperial Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin brought the Death Star superweapon to bear on Alderaan, Rieekan was at nearby Delaya. He received a massive influx of distress calls and requests for evacuation, but hesitated to aid Alderaan, as he felt that his involvement would have implicated Alderaan at large as having ties to the illegal rebellion movement. Within minutes, Tarkin's battlestation fired its superlaser, destroying Alderaan in flash. Rieekan was shattered, and blamed himself for the disaster, as he felt his hesitation had cost many Alderaanians their lives. The incident took its toll on Rieekan, as he became an overly morose and paranoid man.
            He was later tasked with command of the Alliance's Echo Base on Hoth, and also worked closely with the pilot Luke Skywalker's Rogue Squadron unit. Over the years, Rieekan collaborated with the Alderaanian princess, Leia Organa, and his insistence on thorough security and evacuation measures after the destruction of his homeworld proved instrumental to the Alliance when Lord Darth Vader's Death Squadron moved against Echo Base. Rieekan later oversaw Haven Base on Arbra, and would go on to serve as Minister of State and Director of Intelligence for the New Republic, the Alliance's successor state. The general eventually retired, only to be brought back into service during the Yuuzhan Vong War, during which he aided in the failed defense of Coruscant.
            Carlist Rieekan grew up on the peaceful world of Alderaan and left at the age of seventeen to join the Galactic Republic's Judicial Forces,[1] which was an unusual choice for an Alderaanian.[13] Demonstrating strong leadership skills, Rieekan quickly rose through the ranks and joined the Officer Candidate School. There, he befriended other idealists such as Jan Dodonna, Adar Tallon, and Crix Madine.[1] He later came to serve in the Army of the Republic, where his keen grasp of tactics and, once again, his leadership skills impressed his superiors.[4]
            When Supreme Chancellor Palpatine declared himself Emperor in 19 BBY and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire,[14] Rieekan chose to stick to his beliefs and refused to serve the new regime.[1] He instead served the Royal House of Alderaan as a civilian tactician, and then helped found the Alliance to Restore the Republic,[15] an organization dedicated to throwing off Palpatine's hold on the galaxy. In his new role, Rieekan found himself once again amongst like-minded individuals, many of them hailing from Alderaan.[1]
            Rieekan found himself surprised that the Royal House of Organa, rulers of his home planet and vocal pacifists, were themselves allied with the Alliance. He was pleased to find out that Viceroy Bail Organa and his daughter, Princess Leia Organa, were actually members of the Rebellion.[1] Rieekan felt the need to keep his connection to the Alliance secret,[3] but was subsequently placed in charge of covert operations in the Alderaan system. In 0 BBY, he found himself personally inspecting a new satellite transmission station that was in orbit over Delaya, a sister planet of Alderaan. During his inspection tour, the Empire's new superweapon, the Death Star, entered the system, causing mass panic on Rieekan's homeworld. He was hard-pressed to keep up with the flood of incoming calls, requesting evacuation and aid, but there was no weapon capable of disabling or halting the superweapon.[1]
            Furthermore, Rieekan felt that a mass evacuation would show the Empire that the people of Alderaan were aware of the Death Star's ability to destroy entire planets. With that in mind Rieekan decided to sit tight, and hope that the Death Star's presence was just a bluff. Within minutes however, the Death Star's superlaser was activated and fired at Alderaan, completely obliterating the planet. Thrown into a state of despair and guilt, Rieekan resolved to never underestimate just how far the Galactic Empire would go again. Since there was little he physically could do, Rieekan blamed himself for the catastrophe. Some time after the incident, Rieekan was promoted to the rank of General.[1]
            Following the destruction of the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin, Rieekan began assisting various refugee movements across the Alderaan sector, bringing them to Delaya. The general specifically operated in the capital city of Leilani, and was assisted by a young man named Kiro Chen, who hoped to join the Alliance. The planet itself had began to suffer—as the Alderaanians had decided to move all of their industry off their home planet and onto Delaya itself, the planet's income stemmed primarily from exports to Alderaan itself. Compounding the problem was the fact that new factories had been built recently, which worried the General. Prime Minister Gresh Manaa and his deputy, Var Lyonn had sworn to aid Rieekan's refugee efforts, but there were groups amongst the planet's inhabitants that believed in keeping Delaya's resources for the Delayans.[16]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Carlist_Rieekan/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCarlistRieekan</string></dict>
        <key>Tolomar Reez</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.384.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tolomar Reez was a human male from the planet Nar Kanji who served in the criminal gang known as Kanjiklub under leader Tasu Leech. In 34 ABY, he accompanied Leech and several other Kanjiklub members, as well as members of the Guavian Death Gang, in boarding the Eravana, a freighter belonging to the smuggler Han Solo, who owed both gangs money.
            Solo argued with Leech and the Death Gang's frontman, Bala-Tik, in one of the freighter's corridors until a trio of deadly rathtars that the smuggler had captured attacked both gangs. Reez became separated from his comrades while fleeing from the rathtars and then ran into Solo, who punched him in the face and hurled him into the mouth of a rathtar.
            Tolomar Reez[4] was a native of the planet Nar Kanji[1] who served in the criminal group known as Kanjiklub during the cold war between the First Order and the Resistance.[3] In 34 ABY,[2] he and four other members of the gang accompanied their leader, Tasu Leech, in tracking down the smuggler Han Solo so that they could reclaim a loan of 50,000 credits Solo had borrowed from Kanjiklub in order to hunt rathtars. Leech made an alliance with the Guavian Death Gang—another criminal group to whom Solo owed money—before confronting the smuggler, and both groups boarded Solo's Baleen-class heavy freighter Eravana above the planet Jakku.[3]
            Reez and the other Kanjiklub members marched through the Eravana's corridors until they found Solo and his Wookiee partner, Chewbacca, already arguing about their debts with the Death Gang's frontman, Bala-Tik. Reez then stood menacingly beside Leech as the head of Kanjiklub joined the argument, which continued until Bala-Tik recognized Solo's other companion, the astromech droid BB-8, as a fugitive wanted by the First Order.[3]
            Razoo Qin-Fee, Leech's lieutenant,[5] ordered Kanjklub to begin searching the freighter for another pair of fugitives associated with BB-8; however, Reez and everyone else in the corridor were quickly distracted from the droid by the howls of three rathtars that Solo had managed to capture. The rathtars had been released accidentally by the scavenger Rey, one of the two fugitives that Kanjiklub was looking for.[3]
            One of the rathtars then barreled into the corridor behind the Kanjiklub members, grabbing two of them and forcing the remainder to flee down another corridor to their right. Reez became separated from his comrades as he fled and ended up crossing paths with Solo. The smuggler punched Reez in the face as he turned a corner, grabbing the Kanjiklub member by his torso and hurling him directly into the mouth of a rathtar that had been chasing Solo, Chewbacca, and BB-8. The rathtar consumed Reez whole, belching out only one of his boots.[3]
            Reez was a human male with tan skin and black hair.[3]
            Reez wore a brown suit of armor over a yellow tunic with a helmet that included goggles to cover his eyes. He carried a boiler rifle while onboard the Eravana.[3]
            Tolomar Reez first appeared in the 2015 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. The actor playing him was not credited, and the character did not receive a name in the film[3] but was identified by the video game Disney Infinity 3.0, which was released in conjunction with The Force Awakens.[6] Despite the game being non-canon, Lucasfilm Story Group member Pablo Hidalgo confirmed that the names provided by the game for previously unidentified characters, including Reez, were considered canon.[4] In the game, all basic Kanjiklub enemies share his appearance.[6]
            In the novelization of The Force Awakens, written by Alan Dean Foster, Han Solo is described as hurling a member of the Guavian Death Gang into the mouth of a rathtar instead of Reez.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tolomar_Reez</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTolomarReez</string></dict>

        <key>Sol Rivas</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.386.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sol Rivas was a human male who served as a Lieutenant in the First Order. During the Battle of Starkiller Base, he accessed computer records which implicated Captain Phasma in the lowering of the superweapon's deflector shields. In an attempt to cover up her malfeasance, Phasma tried to kill Rivas. However, Rivas escaped in a TIE/fo space superiority fighter to the rocky, ocean world of Luprora. There, he was captured by the semi-sentient R'ora natives, who imprisoned him in their stronghold. Phasma tracked him down and killed him in order to hide her secret.
            Sol Rivas trained as a pilot before becoming a Lieutenant in the First Order military. He was stationed at Starkiller Base during the outbreak of the First Order–Resistance war in 34 ABY. During the Battle of Starkiller Base, he accessed defense shield files which implicated Captain Phasma for her role in lowering the superweapon's shield. Phasma had done so under duress from Finn, Han Solo, and Chewbacca in an attempt to save her own life. The Resistance operatives had then thrown her into a garbage compactor.[2]
            After escaping the garbage chute, Phasma returned to the computer she used to lower Starkiller Base's shields and wiped the records clean of her actions. Realizing that Rivas had also accessed the computer and had proof of her betrayal, she attempted to detain Rivas and frame him for lowering the superweapon's shields and compromising its security. Spotting Rivas on Level Two, Phasma attempted to shoot Rivas, but ultimately failed due to the bombing runs of Resistance Forces. Rivas was able to escape to the surface with Phasma in hot pursuit. As the planet disintegrated around him, Rivas managed to reach an auxiliary hangar where he escaped aboard a TIE/fo space superiority fighter.[2]
            Seeking to hunt down and kill Rivas in order to cover up her own malfeasance, Captain Phasma, the TIE fighter pilot TN-3465, and the BB unit BB-K8 gave chase in a TIE/sf space superiority fighter but were unable to shoot him down since their fighter's laser cannons were inoperable. Running shot on fuel, Rivas landed his fighter on the rocky, oceanic world of Luprora. Shortly after landing, he was captured by the native R'ora, a semi-sentient species of bipedal red skinned creatures with tentacles. Rivas was imprisoned at the R'ora stronghold, which the Lupr'or, a humanoid colonizing species, believed to be impregnable.[3]
            For four days, Rivas was a prisoner of the R'ora. He was bound by ropes inside the R'ora's tower and sustained a bruised right eye and several scratches from his captors. Intent on tracking down and killing Rivas, Captain Phasma led an assault by the Lupr'or on the R'ora stronghold. Phasma took advantage of the fighting to enter the tower where she found a bound Rivas. He was relieved to see Phasma at first. However, Phasma told him that she had come to execute him for his purported treason.[1]
            A defiant Rivas grinned back at Phasma and initially expressed ignorance. Phasma demanded that he confess to his alleged guilt and clear his conscience. Rivas countered that he had nothing to confess about and begged Phasma to spare his life in return for not telling anyone. When Phasma reiterated her demand, Rivas pointed out that she was the one who had lowered the shields and brought about Starkiller Base's destruction. Unwilling to take the fall for her actions, Rivas promised that he would not tell anyone. In response, Phasma shot him dead with her blaster rifle.[1]
            Unknown to Rivas, his execution was witnessed by TN-3465, who had disobeyed Phasma's orders to stay behind and guard the entrance. Before leaving Luprora, Phasma disintegrated BB-K8 and killed TN-3465 in an attempt to remove any remaining loose ends. Phasma then fabricated a report claiming that she had tracked down and executed Rivas for his alleged role in Starkiller Base's destruction.[1]
            Sol Rivas was human man with blonde hair and blue eyes. He had a scar around his left eye and cheek.[2] As a First Order officer, Rivas knew how to fly a TIE/fo fighter.[3] Rivas regarded the R'ora of Luprora as savages for mistreating him during his captivity. As a result of his captivity, Rivas sustained a bruised right eye and several facial scratches. When Captain Phasma tried to coerce him into false confessing his role in Starkiller Base's destruction, Rivas remained defiant and tried to bargain for his life by offering not to tell anyone. Realizing that Phasma meant business, Rivas' defiance gave way to fear and desperation. To cover up her role in Starkiller Base's destruction, Phasma executed Rivas.[1]
            As a First Order lieutenant, Sol Rivas wore a dark tunic, belt, and trousers.[1]
            Lieutenant Sol Rivas first appeared in Star Wars: Captain Phasma, a 2017 four-issue comic published by Marvel Comics as part of the Journey to Star Wars: The Last Jedi promotional material. He was created by Kelly Thompson, illustrated by Marco Checchetto, and colored by Andres Mossa.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sol_Rivas</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSolRivas</string></dict>

        <key>Kylo Ren</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.388.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kylo Ren, a Force-sensitive human male, was the Supreme Leader of the First Order and master of the Knights of Ren during the New Republic Era. Once a promising student of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, the former Ben Solo was neither Jedi or Sith but a product of both philosophies. Through the teachings of his predecessor, Supreme Leader Snoke, Ren came to embrace the dark side of the Force. However, he still felt the pull of the light side of the Force, resulting in much conflict within him. Yet despite his inner struggle, Ren believed it was his destiny to rule the galaxy. He was also determined to destroy the legacy of the Jedi Order as well as the Sith, believing it was time to forge a new galactic order in their place.
            The son of General Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, Ben Solo was born on the Core World Chandrila, on the day the Galactic Empire surrendered to the New Republic in 5 ABY. Though he was given his father's surname, Solo was a Skywalker through his mother. He, therefore, inherited the raw strength of his maternal grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One of the Force. As his own powers manifested in the years following the Galactic Civil War, Solo became part of a new generation of Jedi Knights trained by his maternal uncle, Luke Skywalker. Despite the potential Skywalker saw in his nephew, he also sensed darkness and grew to believe that Snoke succeeded in turning Solo to the dark side. Acting on instinct, for a brief moment Skywalker was prepared to end Solo's life before his future came to pass, but he could not follow through with the act. Solo felt betrayed, however, and reacted by burning down the training temple, resulting in the massacre of the other apprentices as well as Skywalker's self-imposed exile on the planet Ahch-To.
            After severing his ties with Skywalker and the Jedi, Solo pledged his loyalty to Snoke and reemerged as Kylo Ren—the Jedi Killer, warlord and champion of the First Order, and Master of the Knights of Ren. In the waning days of the cold war, Ren oversaw the hunt for the map to Skywalker; his intention to kill the last Jedi and, therefore, complete the legacy of the fallen Sith Lord Darth Vader, his grandfather's dark side persona. This journey ultimately led to Ren's encounter with the Jakku scavenger Rey, whose own strength in the Force mirrored Ren's, and with whom he shared an unprecedented Force-bond with. They became allies as their connection grew stronger following Starkiller Base's destruction in 34 ABY, leading to the assassination of Snoke during the First Order–Resistance war. With ambition fueled by the dark side, however, Ren claimed the mantle of Supreme Leader and continued to pursue his goal of galactic domination, causing Rey to withdraw her support despite Ren entreating her to rule by his side. At this point, the New Republic had fallen; the Resistance, a group of insurgents led by Ren's mother, was decimated at the Battle of Crait; and Skywalker became one with the Force upon sacrificing his life to save the last remnants of the Resistance.
            Even before his birth, Kylo Ren was the subject of Force visions. Shortly after the Battle of Fortress Vader, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, the Sith persona of the famed Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, heard the voice of Ren saying that it was time to "Let the past die" as he slaughtered illusions of Jedi while exploring the portal constructed by Lord Momin in Fortress Vader on Mustafar.[7] Ren's voice was also heard by the Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger, who visited the world between worlds—a mystical plane that existed between time and space[8]—in 1 BBY.[source?]
            Kylo Ren was born as Ben Solo[9] in Hanna City, Chandrila on the day that the Galactic Concordance was signed between the New Republic and the Galactic Empire, formally ending the Galactic Civil War. This day was roughly one year after the Battle of Endor,[1] in which his parents, Princess Leia Organa and General Han Solo, led the Alliance to Restore the Republic in a decisive victory over the Empire. Their victory resulted in the deaths of the Emperor, Darth Sidious, and Organa's biological father, Anakin Skywalker, who ceased to be Darth Vader when he was essentially reborn after decades of bringing despair to the galaxy.[10]
            While he was still in his mother's womb, Organa could feel him through the Force. She likened him to a living band of light that sometimes dimmed and was sometimes thrust through with a vein of darkness. Following his birth, there were contradictory rumors that Ben's birth took three days. Another tale claimed that it was a fast and painless birth. There were also rumors that Ben was born with a shock of black hair and a full set of teeth. Though Han lacked the same Force bond that Organa had with her son, he comforted himself with the fact that he had a fatherly bond with Ben.[1] As a toddler, Ben enjoyed playing with the gold dice that belonged to his father and would often follow him around.[11]
            The namesake of Ben's first name was that of the late Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who went by the name of Ben Kenobi while in exile on Tatooine after the fall of the Jedi Order at the end of the Clone Wars and who sacrificed his life while rescuing Ren's mother from the Death Star battle station in 0 BBY.[12] Ben's surname, that of his father, was originally coined by chief recruitment officer Drawd Munbrin in 13 BBY on Corellia for Han when he enlisted for the Carida Academy to become a pilot.[13] As an infant, Ben had difficulty falling asleep. His father would hold him close in an effort to help Ben sleep. He also introduced his son to a children's holoshow cartoon called Moray and Faz. One night, two years after the fall of the Empire, Chancellor Mon Mothma contacted the Solo house in an attempt to speak with Organa. The household droid, T-2LC, informed Han and activated a holo-projection of the chancellor. In doing so, the droid awoke both father and son, much to the former's annoyance as it had been the first time Ben had slept in days, or so it seemed to Han. The disturbance caused Ben to wake up crying, to which his father responded sympathetically by holding his son close to his chest. After a few moments, Ben drifted back to sleep, his chin resting on his father's shoulder.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kylo_Ren</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKyloRen</string></dict>
        <key>Corso Riggs</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.389.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Corso Riggs was a Human male mercenary during the Cold War. Born on Ord Mantell, he was the employee of Viidu. He was later betrayed by him and joined forces with a smuggler enemy of Skavak.
            Corso Riggs was a cheerful, disarmingly optimistic mercenary soldier. Raised as a rancher's son on the rough frontier of Ord Mantell, Corso developed a mixture of naive innocence and primitive toughness, wrapped with old-fashioned chivalry.
            In addition to his gung-ho enjoyment of a good, dirty fight and his encyclopedic knowledge of weapons, Corso remained a ray of sunshine in even the worst circumstances. He had no sense of his own mortality and was absolutely convinced he was going to live forever. Corso also had a soft spot for damsels in distress, even when it was clear that they were up to no good.
            During the Great Galactic War, Corso grew grew up in a small community on Ord Mantell along with his parents and cousin, Rona Riggs. Corso looked up to Rona, who wanted to leave Ord Mantell and see the galaxy. She would often get into mischief and Corso would have to cover for her. After the Treaty of Coruscant, half of Ord Mantell's population disapproved of the local government's decision to support the Republic and a civil war broke out pitting separatists against Republic loyalists. Corso eventually left Ord Mantell to join the Peace Brigade: a group of mercenaries fighting imperial occupations on neutral planets across the galaxy, but when word reached him that the village he grew up in had been attacked by the separatists, Riggs returned to Ord Mantell vowing vengeance on the separatists responsible for his parents' deaths.
            Near the end of the Cold War, Corso worked with Skavak when a fellow smuggler named Ace arrived to deliver weapons for Viidu. After Skavak had paid the smuggler, Corso sent a message in the hangar that the Separatists captured an air cannon, and had damaged combat ships that were part of the Republic. He asked the Ace, some of the remote control stations for the cannon to destroy, while he wanted to cancel the delivery of the ship with Skavak. However, as the separatists stormed into the hangar, Corso tried to contact Ace for help in his defense until he was pinned down by Skavak, who was the one responsible for helping the attackers. After Skavak fled with Ace's XS Freighter, along with the unloaded weapons delivery and Corso's favorite Blaster "Torchy", Corso tried to contact Skavak, but there was no response.
            Arriving to Fort Garnik, Corso and Ace met Viidu and explained about what happened earlier today. Viidu knew a man named Reki in the village, who knew a lot about the separatists and the freighter pilot. After Ace returned from his meeting with Reki, Corso and Viidu were about to devour a Robasteak. Eventually, he went along with Ace to the next station find out the blueprints and data that the Separatists kept. After decrypting the data from the separatists, Corso and Viidu discovered that Skavak would soon deliver weapons to the Separatist headquarters. There, the two fought Dareg, but they soon discovered that Skavak already escaped. Corso and Ace managed to kill all the separatists and spared Morant, who explained that Skavak had already flown away again a few hours ago with the weapons. After the two returned to Fort Garnik, they found Viidu dead and spotted Syreena chatting with Skavak. It turns out Syreena was a spy, but she was angry how Skavak betrayed her. The two let her go when she provided ticks for a ferry flight to Coruscant. At the spaceport, Corso and Ace encounter Kindin and Xo'ru, bounty hunters who work for Rogun the Butcher. The conversation ended when Corso and Ace had no choice but to fight them.
            During the Eternal Empire's Conquest, Ace went missing. Corso told Risha not to waste time searching for them, but he still held hopes that Ace was alive too.
            Corso Riggs had a tendency to form attachments to his weaponry, and was particularly angry at Skavak for stealing his best blaster, "Torchy." When a smuggler associate of his assaulted Mannett Point, Riggs wanted to join them and cut off the Separatists' legs with his vibroblade, "Hewie."
            Riggs is the first companion character of the smuggler[2] and the second person that the smuggler meets.[3] He gives some helpful pointers to the smuggler when first going to Ord Mantell.
            Riggs can be recruited as a companion around level 7 to assist in the final mission of the Ord Mantell storyline.[2] In the early beta gameplay, it appeared that Corso would be a Kiffar, as he had yellow tattoos over his nose, similar to those of Clan Vos. However, at the game's final release, the tattoos had been removed.
            Corso Riggs is voiced by Troy Hall.
            If the Outlander is based on a smuggler, Corso and Risha return with Ace after the establishment of the Eternal Alliance.
            Explaining that after Ace went missing. Corso and Risha searched for them, but after several years, Corso told Risha not to waste time looking. When Risha was forced to hide from enemies on Dubrillion, Corso went with her. The two found a way to make credits on the side by using Skavak's name. After Vaylin sacked Dubrillion, they heard rumors that Ace was alive and tracked them down. Corso and Risha reunited with their captain, and were welcomed into their new crew.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Corso_Riggs</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCorsoRiggs</string></dict>

He was one of the leading designers of Sienar Fleet Systems, a manufacturing company affiliated with the Galactic Empire. At some point following the Siege of Lothal, he worked at Sienar's factory on Absanz. One day, Ryall stumbled upon Kanan Jarrus and Garazeb Orrelios, two notorious enemies of the Empire, who were searching the facility for intelligence on Sienar's most recent prototypes. In spite of Ryall's claim that he was "just a humble employee," the intruders realized who he really was, and they decided to capture him. Although the factory was full of stormtroopers, Jarrus and Orrelios did manage to steal a Sentinel-class landing craft and take the designer on board. The craft was barely in the air when an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser attacked, causing Ryall to fall through the boarding hatch, but Orrelios caught his hand just in time.

        <key>Reki</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.392.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Reki was a Human male who lived on the planet of Ord Mantell during the Cold War. He was known to have considerable knowledge about the Mantellian Separatist Movement, although was not affiliated with them, and helped the smuggler Voidhound to track down Skavak who worked with the Separatists.[1]
            Reki was a Human male who, during the Cold War, lived on the Republic held planet of Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system[2] of the Mid Rim.[3] Reki lived on Mannett Point where he would steal quality goods from warehouses in the area. However a civil war broke out on Ord Mantell between the corrupt Ord Mantell Central Authority, backed by the Galactic Republic, and a rebel Mantellian Separatist Movement. During the war Separatist forces took over Mannet point and Reki fled from his home, sealing it so Separatists could not enter. He retreated to [a safehouse he owned in Talloran village, another settlement close by, but the Separatists soon also managed to capture Talloran as well. Reki became trapped within his safehouse during the Separatist occupation and took in several other villagers including two women whose husbands had been killed in the Separatist assault.
            During the time he was trapped in Talloran, Reki was visited by the smuggler known as Voidhound. Ace had been sent by Viidu, head of a local freight company, Rendia Freight, who was an old acquaintance of Reki's. The smuggler had been sent to obtain information on the Separatists, whom Viidu believed Reki knew much about, as Skavak, one of Rendia Freight's employees, had stolen a shipment of blaster rifles and joined up with the Separatists. Ace needed to know where they could find out Skavak's location and in return had a survival pack for the trapped man. Reki explained that there was a database of all Separatist personnel kept in a warehouse near his old home in Mannett point. Before the war he had stolen goods from there and so kept a schematic of the building, however it was still sealed in his home on Mannett point. Reki explained that to get to the warehouse Ace would have to get into his home on Mannett point.
            Reki had sealed the house by over loading the door meaning that the town's power would first have to be shut off by destroying the three power relays for the door to open. Once inside the smuggler would have to find the schematics which were concealed with in a Treatise on bird watching that Reki owned and found particularly boring. To access the schematics every mention of the Mantellian flutterplume within the treatise had to be replaced with the number three, once this was done the schematics would be revealed. Finally the smuggler could use the secret back exit to Reki's home to take him to the warehouse. He warned the smuggler that the database would require special equipment to hack into but that Viidu would know more about that. Ace thanked Reki and gave him the supply pack. He later successfully followed Reki's orders and managed to reach the Separatist database and obtain information on Skavak.[1]
            Reki took great precaution in protecting himself and his belongings, hiding the schematics of the warehouse and sealing his own home to prevent Separatists getting in as well as having a safe house set up away from his own home in case of danger. He helped fellow villagers in Talloran when the settlement was attacked and offered to share the supplies that Ace brought him with them. He was however a thief as shown by the fact he used to rob Mannett point warehouses.
            Reki is a non-player character from the massively multi-player online role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic released by BioWare in 2011. He is a character involved in the smuggler classes storyline quest appearing in one mission. It is not possible for players of any other faction to interact with or see Reki unless they are in a party with a smuggler completing the mission.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Reki</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascReki</string></dict>

        <key>Revan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.394.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Revan—renowned as the Revanchist, reviled as Revan the Butcher, worshiped as the Revan, dreaded as the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Revan, and praised as the Prodigal Knight—was a human male who played pivotal roles as both Jedi and Sith in the Mandalorian Wars, Jedi Civil War, and Great Galactic War.
            Believed to have been born around 3994 BBY in the Outer Rim Territories, the child later known as Revan was found by the Jedi Order and apprenticed to the Jedi Master Kreia. The Padawan had an insatiable hunger for knowledge and soon became the Jedi’s most promising pupil. Alongside his friend Malak, he became a Jedi Knight and a vocal and charismatic critic of the Order's inactivity in the ongoing Mandalorian Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. In defiance of the Jedi Council, the Knight took upon the name Revan and started the Revanchist movement to combat the Mandalorians as the Republic Military's Supreme Commander. Revan and his forces gradually pushed back the Mandalorians, saving countless worlds at the price of devastating moral compromises and the embrace of dark side practices. On Malachor V, Revan defeated the Mandalorian leader Mandalore the Ultimate in single-combat and ordered the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon, destroying both armies and the planet but winning the war in the process.
            Revan and Malak, now hailed as the greatest of heroes, vanished into the Unknown Regions to investigate a mysterious Sith influence behind the war. They discovered a hidden Sith Empire and fell under the thrall of the Sith Emperor Vitiate. Vitiate directed the newly anointed Darth Revan and Darth Malak to find the mystical Star Forge to escalate plans of a galactic invasion, but the pair broke free from his mind control and used the Star Forge for themselves—creating their own Sith Empire and a fleet of warships. Intent on unifying the galaxy to destroy the lurking Sith menace, they returned to the galaxy as conquerors and battled the Jedi and the Republic in the resultant Jedi Civil War. Revan almost succeeded, but Malak usurped the throne and fired aboard his flagship during a Jedi ambush led by Bastila Shan. Revan nearly died, but Bastila healed him and took him before the surviving Jedi for judgment.
            The Jedi Council used their powers to wipe Revan’s mind and soon retrained him as a Jedi. Alongside Bastila and newfound companions, Revan was tasked to relocate the Star Forge—the heart of Darth Malak’s Sith Empire. Across his journey, Revan picked up more allies and fell in love with Bastila, but they were eventually intercepted by Malak’s flagship. Malak revealed to Revan his true identity as the former Dark Lord, then captured and corrupted Bastila to the dark side. Revan escaped and, in a last stand, led the remaining Republic fleet against the Star Forge, redeemed Bastila back to the light side, and killed Malak in battle, destroying the Sith Empire he created. Revan married Bastila and sank into obscurity until mysterious visions from his past led him to rediscover Vitiate's Sith Empire. Alongside his former protégé Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile, and the Sith Lord Scourge, Revan attempted to assassinate the Emperor. However, Scourge betrayed the pair, killing Meetra and helping Vitiate imprison Revan.   
            Kept in stasis for three-hundred years, Revan waged telepathic war against the Emperor, tempering his hate and stalling his invasion at terrible cost to his own psyche. Revan was eventually freed by Republic forces and took control of the Foundry space station to construct an army of extermination droids against the Empire, but he was foiled and killed by an Imperial strike team. However, his centuries of anguish had splintered his mind and, although his lighter half became one with the Force, his darker half rejected death and resolved to destroy Vitiate. Although the Emperor's physical body had already been destroyed in battle, his hibernating spirit lingered, so Revan planned to resurrect Vitiate to a physical form to permanently destroy him. A coalition of Imperial and Republic forces, fearing that Revan’s meddling would only bring untold destruction, united with Revan’s light side spirit to defeat him on Yavin 4. Though the Emperor still reawakened and escaped to the galaxy at large, the two halves of Revan merged together in peace and died a final battle.   
            Over three millennia later, the Sith Lord Darth Bane discovered Revan's Sith Holocron and used its teachings to destroy the reigning Brotherhood of Darkness and as inspiration for the Rule of Two, paving the way for Darth Sidious and his Galactic Empire.  
            A Human male,[1] the individual later known as Revan[16] was born in approximately 3994 BBY,[1] and some believed that he had been born in the Outer Rim Territories.[2] The child who would be remembered as Revan was eventually discovered to be Force-sensitive and was accepted into the Jedi Order.[13] The Jedi Master Kreia claimed to have been his first teacher in the ways of the Force.[2] Regardless of the truth of her statement, the Human was trained along with a fellow student named Alek on both the planet Coruscant[13] and at the Jedi Enclave on the planet Dantooine.[17] Both Humans received further training from the Twi'lek Jedi Master Zhar Lestin, who noted that the future Revan possessed what he described as an insatiable desire for knowledge. Lestin believed that it was simply youthful exuberance and eagerness, and he expected the young man to become a champion of the Order—a sentiment shared by Master Vandar Tokare, though Master Vrook Lamar was wary of the student's desire for knowledge.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Revan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRevan</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Ravage</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.395.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Ravage was a Human male Dark Lord of the Sith of the reconstituted Sith Empire and a member of the Dark Council during the Cold War.
            When Darth Baras announced himself as the Voice of the Emperor, Ravage was among those who tolerated his claim for a time being. When Darth Vowrawn, accompanied by Baras' former apprentice, announced the latter as the Emperor's Wrath and stated that Baras was deceiving the Dark Council, Ravage saw the supposed Wrath to be insignificant and was willing to aid Baras in destroying the Wrath. However, Darth Marr stated that it was unclear who truly spoke for the Emperor, and that the one who survived the ensuing battle would speak truth. In the ensuing duel, when it became apparent that Baras was becoming exhausted, he called on the Dark Council for aid, but even Ravage refused to stand in the path of the Wrath. After the Wrath executed Baras, Ravage, along with the rest of the Dark Council, bowed and pledged loyalty to the Wrath, although he personally labeled the new Wrath as a threat.[1]
            Sometime later, Darth Thanaton tried petitioning the Council's aid in killing the former apprentice of Darth Zash, Lord Kallig. However, Kallig intervened and stated that Thanaton deserves to die for abandoning the Kaggath on Corellia. Ravage retorted that the Kaggath is merely trivial and murder had no rules. Though Thanaton tried to defend himself, the Council refused to aid him against a Sith Lord whom seemed impossible to kill. When Thanaton was brought to his knees, Darth Mortis snapped his neck with the Force. Ravage expressed his relief that they are rid of Thanaton. Marr countered that Thanaton was a better Sith than he gives credit for. Mortis then offered Kallig Thanaton's seat, which Ravage voiced opposition to, stating that they can't put a mere Lord on the Dark Council. Marr advised him to be silent, stating that Kallig has earned it in defeating Thanaton in fair combat. He then remedied Ravage's protest by granted Kallig the title of Darth Nox. As the Dark Council retired, Ravage advised Nox not to trust men as humble as Marr.
            Ravage, among fellow Dark Councilors Marr and Nox, was called to Ilum to discuss the betrayal of Darth Malgus. He approved of the death of Darth Serevin during the Battle of Ilum, stating that the time spend among Voss has made him weak. Ravage expressed extreme disdain for Malgus's actions, and later was more than satisfied to hear of his defeat.
            In the aftermath of the Battle of Corellia, the Dark Council met to discuss the successor to Darth Hadra's seat, since Hadra had persished during the battle. Ravage was strongly against Darth Marr's nomination of Darth Karrid as Hadra's replacement and supported Darth Mortis's nomination of Darth Gravus. However, when news arrived that Karrid had killed Gravus, Ravage supported Karrid, complimenting the fact that she saw what she wanted and seized it.
            By 3638 BBY Ravage rapidly expanded into Alzarian territory, believing them to hold no value.[2]
            Darth Ravage detested Darth Thanaton like no other. He was also distrustful of others and was upset when the Council made Kallig a Dark Lord, as well as granting Kallig the place of Darth Thanaton. He shared this sentiment again when Darth Marr nominated Darth Karrid as Darth Hadra's replacement, since she was the former apprentice of the traitor Darth Malgus. Ravage showed much more emotion compared to some of his fellow Dark Councilors. He also seemed to be far more loyal to the Emperor than any of his fellow council members.
            During the flashpoint "The Nathema Conspiracy", if the Outlander is a Sith Warrior who made the Dark Side choice to kill Darth Baras, Ravage will seek revenge on them for killing Emperor Vitiate and join the Order of Zildrog led by Vinn Atrius, only to be sacrificed as fuel to awaken Zildrog by GEMINI 16 on Nathema. If the warrior made the Light Side choice to spare Baras, he will appear instead of Ravage, while the other classes face antagonists from their own class stories.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Ravage</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthRavage</string></dict>

        <key>Miko Reglia</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.398.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Miko Reglia was a male Human Jedi Knight who had been the apprentice of Jedi Master Kyp Durron, and co-founder of the Dozen-and-Two Avengers. He was in love with fellow Jedi Knight Octa Ramis. Miko was a very quiet and humble man who kept mostly to himself. He was very adept at wielding a lightsaber and he spent much of his training time practicing with his blade. He was often given to sitting alone and staring at the stars.[1]
            At some point, Miko Reglia was discovered to be Force-sensitive. He studied at the Jedi Praxeum under Jedi Master Luke Skywalker himself. During his training, he became romantically involved with fellow student Octa Ramis. He was apprenticed to Kyp Durron and later graduated and became a Jedi Knight. Though some Jedi were under the impression that he and Ramis had ended their relationship after graduation, this was apparently not the case, as the couple continued to meet in private.
            Along with his master, Kyp Durron, Miko Reglia co-founded an independent fighter squadron known as the Dozen-and-Two Avengers. The squadron consisted of twelve regular starfighter pilots and two Jedi from whence came their name. During the early stages of the Praetorite Vong invasion, Reglia flew as Durron's wing-man.
            Easily the second best pilot in the squadron, behind Durron, Reglia held no aspirations for command and was content to fly and fight wherever his master felt their presence was necessary. Mostly this duty consisted of minor engagements in hunting smuggler rings in the Outer Rim Territories, much to the disapproval of Luke Skywalker. However things turned more interesting when an observation buoy picked up the distress calls coming from the endangered scientists of ExGal-4 on Belkadan. When they noted a Spacecaster had left the scientific outpost for the fourth planet of the Helska system the Dozen-and-Two went in for investigation.
            Upon arrival at Helska IV the squadron encountered a formidable force of coralskippers using advanced organic technology. While flying wing for Durron, Reglia's state-of-the-art X-wing starfighter was stripped of its shields by way of an artificial gravity well. Without shields Reglia's ship was quickly disabled and he was taken to the icy home base of the Praetorite Vong on the planet below.
            Beaten, bruised, and stripped of all clothing save a tight pair of shorts, Reglia was thrown into an underwater holding cell with the former ExGal-4 scientist Danni Quee. As the first Jedi that the Yuuzhan Vong had been fortunate enough to capture, they were curious to test the willpower of the supposed super-beings. Therefore Reglia's mind would be put through a rigorous regimen designed to break his confidence and leave him stripped of all hope and will. Prefect Da'Gara claimed that Reglia was an unworthy warrior and that he would soon be sacrificed to the Yammosk.
            Reglia proved resourceful upon awaking, however, and with the help of Quee, managed to best their Yuuzhan Vong guards and attempt an escape. The attempt was short-lived however as Da'Gara was able to immobilize the young Jedi using the strong adhesive blorash jelly right in his path.
            He was then subjected to numerous mental anguishes, during which he was convinced that he was at the brink of death countless times, only to find that the nightmare had not released him and would continue to haunt him. The telepathic abilities of the Yammosk played these horrid memories in vivid detail through Miko's mind refusing to allow him a moment of peace, wholly intent on the breaking of the young Jedi's mind.
            With the arrival of Jacen Solo and the New Republic Task Force above Helska IV, and the ensuing rescue attempt made by the young Solo, Miko was afforded his first glimmer of hope since his capture. However, this hope was not for him, and so he pulled two Yuuzhan Vong warriors into the icy depths below the planet's surface, sacrificing himself that Solo and Quee might escape.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Miko_Reglia</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMikoReglia</string></dict>

        <key>Fenn Rau</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.400.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Fenn Rau was a male Mandalorian who served as Skull Leader during the Clone Wars and, after the rise of the Galactic Empire, as the leader of the Protectors of Concord Dawn approximately three years before the Battle of Yavin. During the Clone Wars, he and his fellow Protectors fought alongside the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order. Rau supported the Republic's successor government, the Empire, who tasked him with keeping a watch over the Concord Dawn system for rebel activities. This brought him into conflict with the Phoenix Cell, when they attempted to seek safe passage through the system in order to travel to the Lothal sector. After Rau attacked Hera Syndulla's diplomatic mission, her rebel comrades Sabine Wren and Kanan Jarrus launched a retaliatory attack which ended with his capture by the rebels.
            In captivity, Rau ordered his Protectors not to rescue him and to give the rebellion free passage through the Concord Dawn system. For the next year, Fenn Rau remained a captive of the rebellion. After the rebellion lost contact with the Protectors, Rau was sent on a recon mission to Concord Dawn to investigate the Protectors. There, he along with the rebels Wren, Ezra Bridger, and C1-10P discovered that his nemesis Imperial Viceroy Gar Saxon had killed the Protectors. Rau was forced to work with his nominal enemies to escape Saxon and his Imperial Super Commandos. Due to his respect for Wren's devotion to her rebel comrades, Rau decided to join the rebellion. He later aided Sabine and her family's struggle against the Imperial-backed Clan Saxon. Fenn later took part in the Battle of Atollon.
            Fenn Rau was a human male Mandalorian who, after coming of age, served as the Protector of the Mandalorian colony, Concord Dawn. Thereafter, he led the Mandalorian Protectors, a group of armored warriors who protected the reigning ruler of the Mandalorians: the Mand'alor, for millennia.[3]
            Some time later, Rau, other Mandalorian warriors, as well as various mercenaries were hired by Kaminoan cloners, who themselves had been hired to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic, to train and equip cloned human males of the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Rau traveled to the ocean planet Kamino, where the Kaminoans were centered, in their capital, Tipoca City. In recognition of Rau's ability as a pilot, Rau specialized in training clone troopers who went on to become pilots in the Republic military. Years later, not long after the first batch of cloned soldiers reached maturity, the clones were called on by the Republic for use against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which began the galaxy-wide conflict named for the clones, the Clone Wars. Rau led Skull Squadron (a squadron of Mandalorian fighter pilots) as Skull Leader in numerous battles and skirmishes against the Separatist battle droids, often fighting alongside clone soldiers he had trained.[3]
            In the third year of the Clone Wars, Rau led Skull Squadron during the Third Battle of Mygeeto, on the Outer Rim planet Mygeeto. Rau's actions during the battle helped saved the lives of the Jedi Master Depa Billaba and her Padawan Caleb Dume and many Republic clone troopers.[1]
            Following the transformation of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, Fenn Rau and his Protectors sided with the new regime. About three years before the Battle of Yavin, Rau became the Empire's main ally on Concord Dawn. As Protector of Concord Dawn, he was tasked with fighting rebels forces and reporting on their activities to the Empire. When the rebel pilot Hera Syndulla and Phoenix Cell's Phoenix Squadron traveled to the Concord Dawn system to negotiate for safe passage, they were intercepted by Rau and his Fang fighters, who demanded to know why they were visiting his system. Syndulla replied that the rebels were seeking safe passage and that they would stand with Concord Dawn against the Empire. Rau responded by ordering an attack on the rebels' A-wing starfighters. During the ensuing dogfight, Rau and his Fang fighters shot down two A-wing fighters, Phoenix Three and Phoenix Four, and badly damaged Syndulla's fighter. Syndulla managed to escape back to Phoenix Cell but sustained serious injuries. In response, the Mandalorian rebel Sabine Wren, who had accompanied Syndulla on the mission, advocated destroying Rau's starfighters.[1]
            Wren had tracked Rau's starfighters to a camp on the Third moon of Concord Dawn. The Phoenix rebel commander Jun Sato authorized a retaliatory strike against the Protectors and sent the Jedi Kanan Jarrus—formerly the Padawan Caleb Dume, one of the Jedi Rau saved at Mygeeto—and the astromech droid Chopper to the Concord Dawn system. Despite Jarrus's objections, Wren came along intent on seeking retribution against Rau. Upon reaching the camp, Jarrus told Wren that he still planned to negotiate with Rau, however Wren was intent on destroying his Fang fighters. Splitting up, Jarrus followed Rau into a building, while Wren proceeded to plant charges on the fighters.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fenn_Rau</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFennRau</string></dict>

He backed up his claim by reciting some of the vessel's rather secret technical details, including the location of some hidden compartments.
            He was killed by Cahhmakt when trying to board the Ebon Hawk during the Red Eclipse assault, so the ship remained in Surik's possession.

        <key>Sanjay Rash</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.403.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sanjay Rash, self-stylized as His Royal Majesty King Sanjay Rash, was a tyrannical Human male who was King of Onderon during the Clone Wars and had ties with the Separatist Alliance.
            Rash was affiliated with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The true king was Ramsis Dendup, who was dethroned by Rash and joined the Onderon rebels. Rash was not the true king of the planet, but rather was placed there by the Separatists as a puppet ruler, so that they would have control of Onderon by proxy.
            Around 20 BBY, some citizens of Onderon decided to rebel against Rash's droid occupation, forming the Onderon rebels. After they infiltrated Iziz, and started hit-and-run attacks on the droid army, Rash brought Dendup from his prison, accusing him of orchestrating the rebellion, which he denounced as terrorism, and demanded that he call them off. Dendup denied these accusations, pointing out that he has been in solitary confinement, allowed no contact with anyone, and insists that the people themselves are rising against Rash's rule. He suggested that Rash, as acting king, could end their rebellion by ending the droid occupation.
            As night fell, the rebels destroyed the city power generator, enabling them to ambush the droids under cover of night while winning the people's support. As Rash's Bivall aide Okalin informed him that his royal carriage was ambushed, Rash decided to make the chaos work in his favor and contacted Count Dooku, requesting more troops to defeat the growing rebellion, who pledged his support and promised to send a force led by Kalani, who would be a replacement general leading the army.
            As the rebels began to step up their attacks, General Tandin identified Steela Gerrera, her brother Saw and Lux Bonteri as key members of the rebellion. Tandin suggested that the Onderon militia be allowed to handle the rebels, to which Kalani denied, stating that the rebels may have sympathizers amongst the Onderonian military ranks. Rash then summoned Dendup, once again demanding he call the rebellion off, to which the deposed king repeated he had no hand in starting.
            The next day, Rash planned on publicly executing Dendup, along with Saw, who was captured attempting to rescue the deposed king. It was Rash's intention to demoralize the rebellion, as well as capture the rebels who attempt to rescue him. As soon as the rebels made their move, they were surrounded by droids and forced to surrender. But before Rash could proceed with the execution, Tandin and the military chose to rescue the rebels, having been convinced by Saw that Rash was not acting in Onderon's best interest. Tandin held Rash hostage, allowing Dendup, the rebels and his men to flee, even as Rash reminds the general that he'll be killed once he releases him. However, Jedi Ahsoka Tano emerged from the crowd and used the Force to knock down the droids, enabling Tandin and herself to escape. Rash's droids attempted pursuit, but the populace chose to impede them, openly declaring their support to the rebellion.
            The rebels soon prepared for their final battle to take back the planet. Rash and Kalani sent a large force of battle droids and Heavy Missile Platform droid gunships to combat them. While the rebels were outnumbered, they seemed to have the upper hand, managing to destroy the gunships with rocket launchers.
            At some point after this final skirmish, Dooku contacted Rash and Kalani. Rash quickly explained what had happened and that they would need even more help to defeat the rebels. Dooku coldly refused, not wanting another war to deal with. He commanded Kalani to call back all of the droid forces from the planet. As Rash angrily protested, Kalani shot the deluded king, killing him. Okalin quickly raised his hands, not wanting to suffer the same fate.

            Growing up in the quiet years before the resurgent of the reconstituted Sith Empire in his early career, Rans fought only scattered Mandalorian clans and was totally unprepared to the total war caused by the Sith. However, his quick-thinking and easy charm helped him to ascended the ranks and and to build up the Republic military to new and impressive standards. His looks also made him a media darling. Although this was not enough, and Rans was totally outplayed by the Sith strategy of the Sacking of Coruscant.
            Learning from this terrible lesson, Rans deployed new plans and all his strength to at last annihilate the Sith. For this, Rans commanded the Republic armies in the Battle of Ilum. At one point he was captured by the Imperials, but was rescued and finally, thanks to the division on the Sith side, Rans won the fight. After the battle, Rans retired, and the position of Supreme Commander was transferred to Jace Malcom.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rans</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRans</string></dict>
        <key>Rantu</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.405.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rantu was a human male who served as a major in the Galactic Empire during the early stages of its reign. Rantu, along with Colonel Bergon and Commander Jordo, were assigned to Governor Wilhuff Tarkin to discourage growing tensions with Mon Cala.
            Rantu served as a major in the armed forces of the Galactic Empire. By 18 BBY, Rantu was present aboard the bridge of the Star Destroyer Sovereign in orbit of the planet Mon Cala with Commander Jordo of the Imperial Security Bureau and Colonel Bergon, who were all assigned to assist Governor Wilhuff Tarkin with possible military operations. Tarkin questioned Rantu as to whether his teams were ready in the event that an invasion of the planet became necessary, to which Rantu responded that his teams had been running simulations since they arrived in orbit and that his troopers were now more fish than people. When the shuttle of Imperial ambassador Telvar was shot down, killing all aboard, Tarkin told a lieutenant to inform Rantu that he was to deploy landing craft immediately on his authorization.[1]
            Eventually, the order was given, and Major Rantu deployed the landing craft and a battalion landed in Dac City, culminating in the Battle of Dac City, as well as other incidents worldwide. Major Rantu spearheaded Imperial military operations from a command center in Dac City. During the battle, King of Mon Cala Lee-Char and his military forces evacuated all civilians from surface cities. By the time evacuations were half-finished, King Lee-Char contacted the Sovereign to protest the military invasion, exclaiming that they were not responsible for the death of Ambassador Telvar. After the conversation ended with no success of ending the conflict, and that Lee-Char had warned aggressive action should the Empire continue, Tarkin ordered the lieutenant to contact Rantu and inform him to expect a large-scale counterattack from native forces and that it would occur when the civilian population have been fully evacuated. When the lieutenant asked if he should also inform Rantu on the nature of the attack, Tarkin replied by stating that he did not know what tactic the natives would employ, but that the Empire was fully aware of their military capabilities.[2]
            After the evacuations were complete and King Lee-Char had already attempted a peaceful solution and received advise from Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr on his course of action, enormous creatures emerged from the depths throughout the planet, jumped above water, and crashed down near all of the surface cities, including Dac City, almost immediately destroying them. After the destruction of all surface cities, Tarkin assumed that Rantu was killed in the event along with all of their forces, and assigned the next stage of the military operation to Bergon.[2]
            In preparation for a possible military operation on Mon Cala, Rantu believed that his forces were more comparable to fish rather than people given enough time and training.[1]
            As an major in the armed forces of the Empire, Rantu was capable in deploying planet-wide invasions, and was capable of coordinating military efforts from a command base.[2] Rantu was also able to effectively prepare his forces prior to military operations.[1]
            Rantu debuted in the canon 2018 comic Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 13: Burning Seas, Part I written by Charles Soule and pencilled by Giuseppe Camuncoli.[1]
            There is an inconsistency with Rantu's rank insignia plaque. In one panel he can bee seen wearing a badge with six tiles: three red and three blue. In another panel he has four red tiles on his badge.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rantu</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRantu</string></dict>

As the Battle of Scarif began, Raner was assigned, as a member of Blue Squadron, to help on the surface of Scarif. While most members of the squadron made it past the defenses into the atmosphere, Raner was cut off from the rest of the squadron when the Empire reactivated its orbital gate, resulting in the deaths of two of his fellow pilots, one of them being Vangos Grek. Raner survived by pulling up at the last second, and continued to support the fight with two other members of Blue Squadron who had also been cut off. During the battle he managed to land the shots needed to destroy a shield generator on one Star Destroyer, opening it up to a barrage of ion torpedoes from Jon Vander and his pilots, disabling the vessel. The crippled warship would later be used to destroy the shield gate, securing the Death Star plans for the Rebel Alliance.[2]

        <key>Randd</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.407.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Randd was a male human that served the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War as Grand Moff of the Exterior in the Outer Rim Territories. Sometime after the Rebellion on Akiva, he was considered one of the most elite Imperial officers left surviving. Because of this, he was selected by Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, de facto commander of the Imperial Navy, to be part of his Shadow Council, the proposed successor to the Imperial Ruling Council, with Grand Admiral Rae Sloane as its figurehead. As such, he was present at the meeting where Rax set the stage for the Battle of Jakku. Days before the battle, Randd was aboard the space station Wrath over Ponemah Terminal where he promoted Ciena Ree to the rank of Captain of the Star Destroyer Inflictor. He was also responsible for the tactics used in the battle and although the Empire lost the battle, he himself survived, going on the form the Queluhan Nebula Imperial remnant.
            A male[2] human,[1] Randd was a Grand Moff who lived during the Age of the Empire and the aftermath of the Battle of Endor.[2] By 5 ABY,[5] he was the special governor of the Exterior, a remote sector in the Outer Rim Territories that was one of the few remaining Imperial sectors in the face of New Republic advances and defections. The New Republic was the successor government created by the Rebel Alliance following the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader over Endor. Due to his elite status within the remnants of the Empire, Randd was invited by Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax to join the Shadow Council, an elite ruling council charged with rebuilding the Empire.[3] Randd was also known to have a wife named Danassic, who regarded him as stern and lacking humor.[4]
            The inaugural meeting took place aboard Rax's Super Star Destroyer Ravager in the Vulpinus Nebula, which was home to the largest Imperial remnant under the command of Grand Admiral Rae Sloane. During the Shadow Council's inaugural dinner, Grand Moff Randd questioned the Imperial propagandist Ferric Obdur about what kind of narrative the Empire would promote in the aftermath of Endor. Randd replied that the Empire should promote the narrative that it was the wounded hound that had been kicked out by a brutal, unjust, and deadbeat father. At that point, Rax entered the room and praised the delegates for their ideas. He then revealed that he also commanded other Imperial remnants in the Almagest, the Recluse's Nebula, the Ro-Loo Triangle, and the Inamorata. Randd and the others listened as Rax outlined his plan to use the Imperial factories in Xa Fel, Anadeen, and Turco Prime to rebuild weapons, vehicles, and starships for the Imperial war effort against the New Republic.[3]
            During the attack on Chandrila, Randd met Fleet Admiral Rax in his chamber. He then received orders to mobilize the Imperial fleets to travel to a set of coordinates, which turned out to be the Inner Rim planet of Jakku. Rax also ordered Randd to coordinate the mobilization with General Hodnar Borrum. When Randd expressed puzzlement at Rax's orders, Rax insisted he carry out those orders. Randd relented when Rax alleged that Sloane had approved of Rax's orders. Rax then ordered the Grand Moff to convene a meeting of the Shadow Council.[3]
            During the meeting, Randd was the only Shadow Council member to make eye contact with Rax; a sign of deference. Rax claimed that Sloane had been lost to the New Republic and that every effort was being made to rescue her. Randd listened as Rax claimed the temporary title of Counselor to the Empire and announced that the Imperial remnant fleets would assemble on Jakku for a test to take advantage of the New Republic's setback on Liberation Day; setting the stage for the Battle of Jakku. In secret, Rax planned to eliminate Randd and the other Shadow Council members with the exception of former Commandant Brendol Hux.[3]
            Following the Empire's relocation to Jakku, Randd along with General Borrum, Brendol Hux, and Ferric Obdur remained members of the Shadow Council. In the months after the attack on Chandrila, the Empire waited for the New Republic to launch their attack. After the New Republic discovered their presence and sent a scout ship and a probe droid, Randd opined that they should allow the enemy to arrive at the battle at a slow pace since that would give the Empire time to bolster their numbers. He also informed Counselor Rax that the veterans of Ryloth had arrived in the Star Destroyer Diligent.[4]
            Leading up to the Battle of Jakku, Randd tried to warn Counselor Rax that bringing the Empire to the desolate planet of Jakku could wear down the souls and minds of their troops. However, Counselor Rax reassured him that the Imperials who had come to Jakku were the greatest of their kind and that they would not break. Rax claimed that the harsh conditions would only bolster and harden them like calluses. As a fan of belt-tightening, Randd trusted Rax and regarded him as an admirable, capable, true hero of the Empire. Unknown to Randd and his comrades, Rax was planning to destroy Jakku, the Imperial, and New Republic forces as part of the Emperor's posthumous Contingency plan.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Randd</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRandd</string></dict>
        <key>Arfan Ramos</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.408.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Arfan Ramos was a male Human Jedi Master of the Jedi Order and leader of the Green Jedi during the Cold War and the Galactic War between the Republic and the Sith Empire.
            Born into a wealthy Corellian family, Arfan Ramos had an affinity for The Force that was discovered at an early age. Instead of sending him to the Jedi High Council for training, however, his family gave him over to the Green Jedi of Coronet City--an enclave of Jedi who rejected the High Council's authority and placed loyalty to Corellia above all else.
            Like most of the Green Jedi, Ramos focused primarily on philosophical studies and research into the non-martial uses of the Force. Over the decades, he distinguished himself among his peers and rose to a position of wise, contemplative authority. With the arrival of the Sith Empire and the defection of the local government, however, Ramos recognized the time for pacifism was past, and he was quick to change the Green Jedi's focus. Strong in the Force and a confident and capable leader, he had willingly shouldered the burden that has been thrust upon him.
            Master Ramos was later present on Corellia where he rallied against the Sith invasion of the planet.
            While he was a Jedi by principle, Master Ramos possessed a fiery temper and was quick to words of aggression. Multiple times during his final battle he angrily shouted at his foes or proclaimed their death would be his doing. His anger was enough to see both his students and his fellow Councilors express concern, often forcing him to quote the Jedi Code.
            As a Master sitting on the Corellian Jedi Council, he possessed substantial ability in the Force. In battle, he wielded a yellow-bladed lightsaber, eschewing the common green color sabers analogous to the Green Jedi. Combining his anger into sheer skill, he was a deadly opponent in combat.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Arfan_Ramos</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascArfanRamos</string></dict>

        <key>Dak Ralter</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.410.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dak Ralter was a Human male starfighter pilot and gunner of Rogue Squadron, who served the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. He was Luke Skywalker's aerial gunner during the Battle of Hoth.
            Dak Ralter was born to political prisoners in the Imperial labor colony on Kalist VI. His parents were children of the Galactic Republic, who greatly valued the peace and prosperity of those days. Born into captivity, Ralter instead only knew the galaxy as a place of fear, oppression, and the Empire. As a youth, his parents would often model his dreams with tales of the wonder and delight that existed before the formation of the Empire. These stories were about all that kept him going during his days living inside the huge transparisteel dome of Kalist VI.[1]
            His parents' stories helped to keep alive a spark of hope inside the young Ralter. He knew that someday his hopes would come to fruition, as they did when he was seventeen standard years old. A new prisoner named Breg came to the camp one day, and being just a bit older than Ralter, the two became fast friends. Breg was a Rebel pilot who was downed while on a reconnaissance mission. Luckily for Breg, the Empire did not know of his affiliation, or he likely would have faced an interrogation droid, or worse.[1]
            Breg was a free spirit who fueled the flame of liberty inside of Ralter with further tales of a life beyond the confines of Kalist VI. He made quite an impact on the impressionable Ralter. Together they planned an escape from the penal colony. Ralter took to this opportunity with all the energy born of a lifetime of pent-up anger and aggression. When his parents learned of their son's plan, they encouraged him, knowing it might be his only chance for a life beyond captivity. They also knew that trying to go with him would only hamper his chances, and they insisted he go without them. It was a difficult choice for the teenage Ralter, but he heeded their wishes.[1]
            Their plan was to hijack an Imperial prison barge and blast away from the planet. While waiting for the barge, Breg and Ralter vaulted the inner power fence of the camp, shorted out the outer fence, and managed to make it past the unsuspecting sentries. Once a few slightly-used Imperial guard uniforms were "borrowed," gaining access to the landing area was relatively easy. They triggered a false reactor alarm and staged a prearranged power outage in order to board the prison barge and clear all moorings. But before they could lift off, an Imperial stormtrooper saw what was happening, boarded the ship, and tried to stop the two youths. Breg was shot before Ralter could blast the trooper in return. The Rebel fugitive lay wounded and dying on the cockpit floor.[1]
            This left the piloting duties up to Ralter. He had no previous experience with any technology more sophisticated than a laser drill. He bravely manned the ship's controls while Breg, only able to speak, directed him through takeoff. Ralter displayed a natural affinity for flying. Under Breg's guidance they were able to blast away from the planet and escape into hyperspace. Breg instructed Ralter to plot a course for the Rebel base on the planet Tierfon. When they arrived, Ralter was forced to land the ship unaided. Breg's condition had worsened and he now lay unconscious. The landing was by no means pretty, but it was in many respects miraculous. Despite the best efforts of Ralter to save his friend, Breg died soon after landing. Nevertheless, with Breg's help Ralter was able to escape imprisonment and start a new life with the Rebel Alliance.[1]
            To honor the man responsible for his freedom, Ralter joined the Rebellion's pilot corps, presumably completing his training at Tierfon.[1] After proving his piloting abilities, he was assigned to the burgeoning Rogue Group under the command of Luke Skywalker after the Battle of Yavin. Officially, Ralter replaced Biggs Darklighter's spot in the squadron. He was one of the youngest pilots to serve with the Rogues during his tenure.[3]
            His earliest service with Rogue Group saw him escorting convoys through Imperial territory and participating in some of the squadron's most dangerous early conflicts. He assisted in protecting supply convoys against Imperial forces on the planet Barkhesh; recovering the downed Rebel ship, the Nonnah, on Chorax; the evacuation of General Crix Madine from the Imperial assault on Corellia; the liberation of Gerrard V; the destruction of Imperial installations on the Jade Moon of Loronar; destruction of the AT-AT manufacturing facility on Balmorra; the destruction of the Kile II spaceport; and the rescue of Wedge Antilles from the penal colony of Kessel. In 1 ABY, he fought in the campaign against Moff Kohl Seerdon, including service at the Battle above Taloraan, the Escape from Fest, Seerdon's blockade on Chandrila, the Raid on Sullust, and the ultimate destruction of Seerdon during his invasion of the bacta facilities on Thyferra.[3]
            Also in 1 ABY, he was seen in Dearic on the planet Talus.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dak_Ralter/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDakRalter</string></dict>

        <key>Ramid</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.412.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ramid was a Human male captain of a starship who was a former love interest of Ania Solo, a descendant of the smuggler Han Solo. During the last years of the Second Imperial Civil War, he and Ania Solo were imprisoned at an Imperial prison camp on the planet Drash-so. At some point, Ramid and Ania attempted to escape their prison camp. While Ania managed to escape offworld to the Carreras system, Ramid was recaptured, beaten and imprisoned by the guards. Following the defeat the One Sith, Fel Empire forces liberated the Drash-so prison camp and freed Ramid. Due to his experiences on Drash-so, Ramid harbored a deep sense of bitterness and resentment towards his former lover.
            By 139 ABY, Ramid had become the captain of a starship that traveled throughout the Outer Rim Territories. That year, an opportunity to settle scores with Ania emerged when the Galactic Federation Triumvirate, the new galactic government, placed a bounty on her head for the alleged murder of the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton. While Ania and her companions were visiting Lasgo Port, Ramid and his crew tricked Ania into coming aboard their starship under the pretext of repairing their damaged engine systems. Once aboard, Ania was kidnapped and imprisoned. Ramid and his crew intended to take Ania to the next inhabited system and hand her over to the Imperial authorities. However, Ramid's plans were thrown into disarray by the arrival of a third party—a mysterious bounty hunter who had been Ania and Ramid's former jailer.
            Following a prolonged pursuit over a remote world that rained acid, molten silica, and glass, the bounty hunter succeeded in downing Ramid's starship and killing his crew. However, Ramid and Ania survived the crash and joined forces to evade the bounty hunter and make their way to the planet's sole settlement, where they hope to get a transport offworld. While sheltering under Ramid's speeder bike during a "glass storm", the couple reconciled their differences. Ramid forgave Ania for abandoning him on Drash So while Ania forgave Ramid for kidnapping her. After the storm had subsided, they made their way to the settlement only to come under attack by the mysterious bounty hunter. During the confrontation, Ramid attempted to sever the bounty hunter's prosthetic hand but got his neck broken, killing him. Despite his death, Ania managed to clear her name with the help of the Imperial Knights Yalta Val and Jao Assam.
            Ramid lived during the time of the Second Imperial Civil War, a conflict between the One Sith and their Galactic Empire, and the Fel Empire and their Galactic Alliance allies. At some time, Ramid developed a romantic relationship with Ania Solo, a distant descendant of the smuggler Han Solo and a relation of the future Empress Marasiah Fel.[2] Near the end of the Second Imperial Civil War, Ramid and Ania ended up in an Imperial labour camp on the planet Drash-so. During their time, the two were regularly beaten and mistreated by their Imperial guards, who wielded laser whips. At some point, Ramid and Ania plotted to escape from the labor camp. During their escape attempt, Ramid was shot and wounded by his Imperial captors.[1]
            Believing that her love interest Ramid was dead, Ania fled offworld and eventually ended up in the Carreras system. However, Ramid survived the shooting and was thrown into solitary confinement by his Imperial captors. During his incarceration, Ramid was regularly beaten and tortured by the guards who demanded to know Ania's whereabouts and hos she had escape. After holding out for an unspecified period of time, Ramid broke down and told them everything he knew about Ania. The Imperials then followed Ramid's information but were unable to find Ania. Assuming that he had been lying, they had Ramid beaten up again. Following the death of the usurper Emperor Darth Krayt, the Drash-so prison camp was liberated by Fel Empire forces and Ramid was released. Due to his brutal experiences, Ramid harbored a deep sense of resentment and anger towards Ania, whom he believed had betrayed and abandoned him.[1]
            By 139 ABY, Ramid had become the captain of a starship and commanded a crew that included a female Twi'lek pilot and a Nikto crew member. While visiting the spaceport Lasgo Port which was based on a planet surrounded by a dangerous minefield, Ramid learnt that the new galactic government, the Galactic Federation Triumvirate, had imposed a bounty on her head for the alleged murder of the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton. Ramid somehow learnt that Ania was visiting the planet while her assassin droid companion AG-37 was delivering a shipment on his freighter. Ramid saw Ania's visit as an opportunity to exact revenge against his former lover. Ramid and his crew switched off their starship's atmospheric and communication systems and left their vessel adrift in the space minefield.[2]
            When AG-37's freighter passed by Ramid's starship, Ramid fired small-bore blaster shots at AG-37's freighter. Ania and her crew thought that a meteor had hit their starship and sent their Imperial comm droid to repair the surface damage. While doing its repair job, the droid spotted Ramid's seemingly-stricken vessel nearby. Ramid and his crew had switched off their ship's atmospheric and communication systems and donned spacesuits, creating the impression that their starship had broken down in space. After AG-37's freighter came to their aid and docked with Ramid's starship, Ania and her companions boarded the vessel to offer help and assistance. Ania soon encountered Ramid and his crew, and the two former lovers shared a passionate kiss. Ania was surprised that Ramid had survived which prompted the latter to comment that he was tougher to kill that he looked.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ramid</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRamid</string></dict>
        <key>Sotorus Ramda</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.413.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sotorus Ramda was a male human general in service of the Galactic Empire. He commanded the Scarif garrison during the Battle of Scarif. He was relaxed in his duties as commander of the Imperial garrison on Scarif.
            General Sotorus Ramda commanded the Scarif Deployment garrisoned at the Imperial security complex on Scarif in 0 BBY, and was known to be relaxed in his duties there. The base was regarded as a place for long-serving officers to wait out the years until their retirement; with the Shield Gate considered to be an impenetrable defense, the garrison on the planet itself seemed almost ancillary. As a result of this lax leadership, Ramda was completely unprepared for the consequences of his hubris.[1]
            In the days prior to the Battle of Yavin, Ramda received Director Orson Krennic, who traveled to Scarif to investigate any and all transmissions sent by the now deceased Imperial scientist Galen Erso, who was the source of information of the Death Star that was leaked and found its way to the Rebel Alliance. Ramda obeyed, though he voiced his surprise at the magnitude of the order, as there was an abundance of transmissions that had been sent by Erso.[2]
            Not long after Krennic arrived on Scarif, Alliance special forces infiltrated the Shield Gate space station that guarded the planet, and landed on the surface, launching a surprise attack on the Imperial complex in a bid to steal the Death Star plans, and were later reinforced by an Alliance Fleet led by Admiral Raddus. The Imperial security complex would eventually be destroyed in the final stages of the battle by the Death Star itself, as Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin order the battle station to fire upon Scarif in order to prevent the theft of the plans, and to eliminate his rival Krennic who sought to command the Death Star himself. Although the Alliance sustained heavy casualties, they were able to transmit the Death Star plans to the Alliance flagship Profundity, and the plans were then by transported to the docked Tantive IV which escaped the battle.[2]

There, he was met by Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi–his supposed victim, now physically altered to look like him. Hardeen was apprehended by the two Jedi, and his identity assumed by Kenobi in order to plant himself in a Republic prison. Hardeen's reputation for having killed a Jedi was essential to the plan, as Kenobi used it to gain the trust of other prisoners and attract the attention of Moralo Eval,[2] from whom Kenobi was to acquire intel that would help the Jedi prevent the kidnapping attempt.[3]
            Rako Hardeen appeared in the episode "Deception" of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series, where he was voiced by James Arnold Taylor.
            Originally, the episode "The Box" would have included a storyline in which Anakin Skywalker would have searched for the real Hardeen once he discovered that Kenobi was alive. Though the Council would have denied Hardeen's existence, Skywalker would have intercepted Captain Rex transferring Hardeen off-world, forcing the Council to divulge the truth. The thread was cut for time constraints, clarity and character focus, and it seeming unlikely that Rex would keep a secret from Anakin.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rako_Hardeen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRakoHardeen</string></dict>

He died in 19 BBY on Nicht Ka, killed by Malleus, a failed Jedi who had been corrupted by the dark side of the Force.
            In 22 BBY, he and his apprentice Lumas Etima were present in the Petranaki arena during the First Battle of Geonosis. While Ryelli lost three fingers during the combat, Etima was overpowered by the sheer number of enemy battle droids and died in the arena. Maimed physically and mentally, Ryelli lost the will to fight. He retired from combat and requested to be reassigned as a Jedi archaeologist instead.
            Four years later, in the final days of the Clone Wars, the Jedi Master was sent to Nicht Ka, a forgotten planet located on the border of the late Sith Empire, where a mysterious structure had been discovered. When he arrived there with two members of the Exploration Corps, a Givin astrogator Staguu Itincoovar and the Human pilot Telloti Cillmam'n, the archaeologist started examining a few carving on the walls. He allowed Cillmam'n to look around the place while Itincoovar was searching their starship's database. A bit later, Ryelli found the pilot in another room, wearing an ancient suit of armor which he felt was infested with the dark side of the Force. Cillmam'n then confronting Ryelli, blaming him for giving up the fight after what happened on Geonosis. The two men engaged in a fierce lightsaber duel, and although Ryelli seemed to get the upper hand, the other took the high ground by using a secondary blade from his lightsaber's butt. Ekim Ryelli was then beheaded at the very moment Itincoovar tried to contact him via comlink to announce that the Clone Wars had been won by the Republic.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ekim_Ryelli</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascEkimRyelli</string></dict>
        <key>Havoc  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.419.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"Havoc" was the nickname of an ARC clone commander who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Bred on the Wild Space world of Kamino far above the galactic plane, he received constant military training with his brothers. Circa 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars he participated in a battle fought on his homeworld, which cost his life.
            Havoc was bred on Kamino for the Grand Army of the Republic and was one of the millions of clones of Jango Fett, a Mandalorian bounty hunter. He and his brothers received constant military training in the years that followed his conception.[1]
            He was seen with Advanced Recon Commando Commander Colt and Blitz observing the Domino Squad when they were training in the clone military education complex on Kamino.[5]
            He was with a squad of clone troopers when two trident drills appeared and dispatched aqua droids commanded by Grievous, who ordered the machines to kill all the clones. The troopers immediately engaged Grievous's forces. While helping a wounded clone Havoc spotted 99 giving troopers extra DC-15 rifles, and he immediately ordered 99 out of the danger. But while distracted, Havoc was shot in the shoulder, while saying "99 get out of here!" and received a hit to the head moments later. 99 then grabbed Havoc's standard clone backpack that was full of grenades, and quickly hurried off to find Echo and Fives.[3]
            Havoc had blue markings on his experimental Phase II clone trooper armor with a rangefinder on the right side of his helmet. He wore a unique shoulder pauldron and had four blue squares that covered his chest and abdomen. He, Colt, and Blitz all wore the same specialized pauldron. Finally, he wore a kama with blue stripes. In combat, he wielded a DC-15A blaster rifle. During the Battle of Kamino, he used a standard Republic backpack,[3] which 99 used later.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Havoc_(ARC_trooper)/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHavoc</string></dict>
        <key>Rajivari</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.420.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rajivari was a male Human Jedi Master who was among the founding members of the Jedi Order and the first of the Jedi High Council.
            A Force-sensitive Male Human, Rajivari was considered one of the wisest Je'daii Masters of the Je'daii Order and one of its top Generals. Recognized for his leadership and wisdom, Rajivari led armies during the Despot War, winning many battles, but after the war he decided to lay down his weapon and live in isolation on one of the islands surrounding the Temple of Akar Kesh in order to meditate on the Force. One of his former apprentices, Ketu, who had become the Temple Master of Akar Kesh sometimes visited him for advice on the important matters of the Je'daii Order.
            Thus, in 25,800 BBY, Ketu came to tell his former master about the Dark visions that Daegen Lok had allegedly seen in the depths of the Chasm, warning about the coming of an army led by an individual with one red eye and wielding a sword of fire. Seven years later, Rajivari was visited again by Ketu, who came this time with news about the vision received by three Je'daii Journeyers and the foreseen arrival of the Force Hound Xesh. Rajivari who firsthandly didn't agree with the decision of the master to not consider the vision of Lok, questioned once again the wisdom of Ketu when he learned that the stranger had been exiled on Bogan, stating that "where there is one warrior, an army may follow."
            Some time later, Ketu asked Rajivari to Akar Kesh, to help access the Kwa Holocron, a relic of an extinct ancient and interstellar civilization which had been accessed by Tasha Ryo. However, when Ryo showed the Holocron's guardian A'nang a skull found aboard the alien ship, he cried "Rakata!" and vanished.
            Now, Rajivari attempted to access the Holocron before, Ketu, Ryo, and Ters Sendon. A'nang explained that the Rakata were a vicious Dark Species who had seized control of the galaxy and driven the Kwa to extinction.
            Possessing considerable power, Master Rajivari was one of the first of the Jedi High Council, convening on the world of Tython and dictating the Jedi Order's creed. Training the first Jedi Lore Keepers, Rajivari secretly established the first incarnation of the Jedi Archives which he named the Fount of Rajivari. At some point, Master Rajivari fell to the dark side of the Force and attempted to destroy the Order he had a hand in founding. He and his several followers embraced a set of principles which ran counter to the Jedi and were able to hole up within the walls of the ancient Temple of Knowledge, Kaleth. Rajivari was defeated in the siege of his fortress, and memory of the Fount was lost to myth.[1]
            Following the Great Galactic War and the resurgence of the Sith Empire, a hologram of Master Rajivari was discovered on Tython when the Order relocated from Coruscant. Known as the Northwest hologram, the Jedi sought to reclaim it for the Tythonian Gnarls but discovered that it had already been stolen from its hiding place. His spirit remained in the ruins of the fount until a young Jedi Padawan entered the place and encountered the spirit of Rajivari. Rajivari explained the history of the Fount and how it was made and that Nalen Raloch was planning to use the fount to destroy the Jedi on Tython. Master Rajivari told the Padawan to stop Raloch and save the Jedi Order. Returning the Jedi Master to the light side, the Padawan convinced him to leave the Fount and move on to become one with the Force.[1]
            Rajivari was very charismatic and as a result, he mobilized an entire army of the Order's members to follow his own views. He thought of his fallen apprentices as if his own children, gifted and loyal, initially hoping Nalen Raloch would prove as worthy despite him neglecting the value in solving Rajivari's traps at the Fount of Rajivari. Due to these traps, Nalen became crazy and Rajivari regretted teaching him because, although Rajivari wanted the Order destroyed, he would also want it rebuilt soon after but Nalen was only bent on destroying the Order, permanently.
            According to Jedi Master Yuon Par, Rajivari was immeasurably powerful and as a result he was able to move an army of members from the Jedi Order to follow his own principles. Further evidence of his powers was when he proved himself worthy to the droid guardians, when retrieving the hilt of the First Blade. After he was killed, Rajivari was able to become a Force ghost.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rajivari</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRajivari</string></dict>
        <key>Razoo Qin-Fee</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.421.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Razoo Qin-Fee was a human male from the planet Nar Kanji, who served as a lieutenant in the criminal gang Kanjiklub around 30 years after the Battle of Endor. He was a pyromaniac and technical expert and was in charge of assembling and maintaining Kanjiklub's wide range of weapons and armors. The underground Zygerrian fighting circuit expelled Qin-Fee for cheating. He carried a "Wasp" blaster rifle for use in battle.
            He and the other gang members and the Guavian Death Gang confronted the smuggler Han Solo over fifty thousand credits he owed them on board the Baleen-class heavy freighter Eravana. The two gangs realized that Solo was also transporting the astromech droid BB-8 and two fugitives from the First Order on board the freighter and began searching for them, but were interrupted and prevented from killing Solo when three rathtars, Solo's inadvertently released cargo, attacked both groups. Though not one to shy away from a fight, Qin-Fee wisely decided that this foe was beyond his capabilities and promptly ran for his life. Unlike nearly all of his comrades, Qin-Fee managed to avoid being devoured by the vicious creatures. In the confusion created by the rathtars, Solo and the fugitives managed to escape from the Eravana.
            Razoo Qin-Fee was a native of the planet Nar Kanji who was banned from the underground Zygerrian fighting circuit for cheating, despite the fact that the sport lacked any rules. He became a member of the criminal Kanjiklub gang who operated out of Nar Kanji, and by thirty years after the Battle of Endor, served as a lieutenant and second-in-command to the gang's leader Tasu Leech. Qin-Fee was responsible for the maintenance of the gang's mismatched weapons and armor, and regularly modified them to the other gang members specifications.[1] After the Kanjiklub leant the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca fifty thousand credits to capture rathtars for King Prana, Qin-Fee was amongst a group of gang members who accompanied Leech to reclaim the loan from Solo.[2]
            The gang boarded Solo's Baleen-class heavy freighter Eravana above the planet Jakku, and found Solo in the ship's airlock arguing with the Guavian Death Gang, another criminal faction he had borrowed from. Leech and Bala-Tik, leader of the Death Gang, both demanded their money back from the smugglers, but then took interest in the astromech droid BB-8, who was stood with Solo and matched the description of a droid the First Order were looking for alongside two fugitives.[2] Suspecting the fugitives were also onboard, Qin-Fee stepped forward and another member of Kanjiklub began searching the airlock with an illuminator.[4]
            As the criminals searched, Solo attempted to stall for time by claiming the droid was his and not the one being searched for, but Bala-Tik saw through the lie and demanded that Solo hand over BB-8 and the fugitives. Qin-Fee offered the alternative that Solo simply die, which earned a laugh from several other criminals, before the lights of the airlock corridor began flickering, accompanied by unearthly noises. Uncertain of this new development, the Death Gang and Kanjiklub prepared to kill Solo and Chewbacca and take the droid,[4] but were interrupted when both criminal factions were attacked from behind by the rathtars, which had accidentally been let loose by the scavenger Rey and the former stormtrooper Finn; the fugitives that the criminals were searching for.[2]
            Qin-Fee fled down the corridor away from the rathtar, but paused when he passed a pair of Guavians fleeing in the opposite direction. He then hailed another Kanjiklub member to approach him, but quickly decided to follow the Guavians after the gang member was grabbed by a rathtar. He then encountered another two Kanjiklub members and briefly conversed with them, deciding to avoid both ends of the airlock and head down a third corridor. His comrades were then devoured by another rathtar and Qin-Fee was forced to flee alone in the opposite direction from the Kanjiklub's starship, leaving his only hope of survival to circle back around and avoid the rathtars.[4] He, unlike many of his comrades survived, being able to escape the rathtars. Solo, Chewbacca and the fugitives managed to escape the Eravana onboard the YT-1300 light freighter the Millennium Falcon, killing one of the three rathtars on the heavy freighter as they left.[2]
            Qin-Fee was an unpleasant human male pyromaniac and technological expert.[1] While fleeing the rathtars on the Eravana, he was terrified for his life, only taking solace in the fact that Solo would most likely be killed by the beasts.[4] He wore his black hair in a Zygerrian-style faux crest and had brown eyes and tanned skin.[1]
            While onboard the Eravana, Qin-Fee a set of patchwork armor including a bandolier of homemade explosive cylinders and a pair of insulated palm sparring gloves. He used a "Wasp" blaster rifle[1] in combat and carried an illuminator.[4]
            Razoo Qin-Fee was portrayed by Iko Uwais in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which names him as "Razoo Quin-Fee" in the credits. He had no dialogue in the film, but received lines in its novelization written by Alan Dean Foster, also briefly serving as a point of view character. There are several discrepancies between the amount of dialogue in the novel and the film, but as Qin-Fee's line takes place at a time in the novel which does not contradict the timeline of the conversation in the film, this article assumes it is canonical.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Razoo_Qin-Fee</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRazooQinFee</string></dict>
        <key>Rian Darok</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.422.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rian Darok was a Human male colonel in the Republic Army during the Galactic War against the reconstituted Sith Empire. He headed the Korriban Incursion ops in 3638 BBY. Coincidentally, the Sith Empire launched an Assault on Tython at the same time and Darok had to rally his forces to defend the planet. The Republic strike team under his command during these back to back battles were granted the Medal of Valor and Darok was tasked with aiding the Jedi in recovering from the attack. Since the Assault on Tython, Darok has been keeping a low profile: strategy meetings with special forces officers and spending a lot of time in his terminal. Still, he made two intelligence requests from Republic Strategic Information Service: "Isotope-5 Proliferation and Deployment in the Empire" and "Known Smugglers: Inner Rim".
            Suspicious of the timing of the attacks and of Darok's withholding information, SIS agent Theron Shan tracked him to a secret laboratory complex on Manaan with the aid of Lana Beniko, who shared similar suspicions; she had been the advisor to Darth Arkous of the Dark Council, who had orchestrated the attack on Tython. They learned that Darok and Arkous were members of the secretive Order of Revan, originally believed to have been a fringe group within the Empire, who sought to use Rakata technology to create an "Infinite Army". The Republic and Imperial pursuers tracked the two men to Lehon (or Rakata Prime, as it was known then), the former capital of the Infinite Empire, where the Revanites oversaw the creation of their army. Confronted at the summit of the Temple of the Ancients, Darok refused to be taken prisoner and was killed along with Arkous, despite Theron's hope that he could be taken alive so that they could learn more about the Revanites. But it was soon revealed that they were not the real leaders, as Revan himself arrived soon after.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rian_Darok</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRianDarok</string></dict>

        <key>Pulsipher</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.428.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Pulsipher was a member of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders whose fascination with Force artifacts led him to unearth the powerful Sith relic known as the Muur Talisman during the Mandalorian Wars. Originally assigned as the assistant to the notorious Mandalorian scientist Demagol, Pulsipher reluctantly aided in Demagol's experiments on captured Jedi, believing the doctor's efforts to discover the source of Jedi abilities to be pointless—Pulsipher believed that the Force was a myth and Jedi powers were derived from magical possessions, and he became fixed on one in particular: the Muur Talisman, which be believed to be on the Outer Rim world of Taris. Pulsipher gathered a survey team and went to Taris in search of the artifact after the Mandalorians captured the world, and managed to unearth the Talisman deep within the planet's Undercity. However, after bringing the Muur Talisman back to the Mandalorian staging point of Jebble, Pulsipher realized exactly what he had gotten into. The Talisman, moving with a mind of its own, bonded with Pulsipher and transformed the Mandalorians around him into mindless rakghoul beasts that he controlled. Pulsipher embraced the power of the Talisman as a way to earn respect and unite all under the Mandalorian banner, but was killed by the mutants he once commanded when the Talisman abandoned him for a more suitable host, Jedi Shadow Celeste Morne.
            A Human male, Pulsipher served in the rampaging army known as the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders during their war with the Galactic Republic several millennia before the Battle of Yavin. After several years of cold conflict, Mandalore the Ultimate began the attack on the Republic in earnest in 3963 BBY. As the Mandalorians sped towards the Outer Rim Republic planet Taris,[3] the Mandalore assigned Pulsipher to be an assistant to the notorious scientist Demagol in his experiments upon captured Jedi in an outpost on the airless world of Flashpoint—the two often clashed in their efforts to study the source of Jedi Force powers, as Pulsipher believed their abilities stemmed from their possessions.[4] Pulsipher was present when former Jedi Padawan Zayne Carrick and rogue Mandalorian warrior Rohlan Dyre successfully faked a Republic attack, captured Demagol and convinced the Mandalorians to abandon their outpost,[3] and was among those who escaped Flashpoint.[5] Pulsipher was later reassigned to the Mandalorian rallying point of Jebble, where he was given his own laboratory at the top of the planet's Ice Citadel[2] and toiled in vain to earn the same type of respect from Mandalore the Ultimate that Demagol had.[1] Searching for something to make his name,[2] Pulsipher deciphered a series of half-purged Jedi transmissions convinced Pulsipher that the rakghoul-infested wasteland known as the Undercity might contain an ancient Sith artifact: the Muur Talisman, which was enough for Pulsipher to gather a survey team and travel to Taris in the shuttle Mar'eyce.[2]
            After arriving on Taris, and after extensive mining activity in the Undercity's depths, Pulsipher found his prize: the Muur Talisman,[5] buried under meters of rock piled up by a cave-in decades before.[2] Pulsipher also managed to find several other Sith artifacts, including the life-preserving Dreypa's Oubliette, which he added to his haul.[1] Thrilled with his find, Pulsipher gathered his team and returned to Jebble, finding only disrespect from the "real" Mandalorian warriors who welcomed him home. Pulsipher believed the Muur Talisman contained some sort of power, but was not sure exactly what it did—he learned when Jedi Shadow Celeste Morne, who was tracking the Muur Talisman and had stowed away on the Mar'eyce, attempted to mind trick Pulsipher into throwing the artifact out the ship's airlock. Pulsipher's rejection of Morne's Force suggestion and resolution to keep the Talisman for himself triggered something in the ancient amulet, as the previously lifeless medallion began to move and fuse itself to Pulsipher's arm. Briefly overcome by the Talisman's power, Pulsipher killed one of his crewmembers with a single touch, and was frightened to realize he could no longer remove the Muur Talisman from his left hand. Afterward, several of his survey team had to help a weakened Pulsipher to the Ice Citadel, which had become the Neo-Crusaders' headquarters on a world that was a staging point for millions of newly enlisted Mandalorian warriors.[2]
            Although Pulsipher was hoping to quickly remove the Talisman and feel better, but he soon realized that the real power of the Talisman had already been unleashed, when the Mandalorians who had been with him on the Mar'eyce began transforming into rakghouls and quickly spreading their plague to the people around them.[2] The Mandalorian rakghouls—whom, as the holder of the Muur Talisman, Pulsipher commanded—quickly ripped through the uninfected Mandalorians on Jebble and converted them into mindless beasts. No longer afraid of the Talisman's power, Pulsipher instead saw a way that he could complete the Mandalorian crusade and bring every living being into his clan. However, he could tell that he had only scratched the surface of the Talisman's power. A stray transmission led him to Zayne Carrick, who had stowed away with Morne on the Mar'eyce, and Pulsipher had his rakghouls capture the former Padawan in the hopes that Carrick could help him unlock the true potential of the artifact. Carrick refused to play along, and as Pulsipher threatened to place him in suspended animation within Dreypa's Oubliette, the Talisman began to move and separated itself from his body. No longer in possession of the Muur Talisman—which moved onto a more worthy host, Celeste Morne—Pulsipher was swiftly ripped apart by the same rakghouls he commanded only moments before.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pulsipher</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPulsipher</string></dict>
        <key>Dred Priest</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.429.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dred Priest was a Human male Mandalorian warrior who was accepted into Jango Fett's invitation to train clone commandos on the planet Kamino as part of the Cuy'val Dar. During his time on Kamino, Priest earned the ire of some of his fellow Mandalorian Cuy'val Dars. Kal Skirata and Walon Vau abhorred his Death Watch leanings, believing wholeheartedly that Mandalorians ought to restore their old glory by conquering the galaxy. Another Mandalorian training sergeant, Mij Gilamar, loathed Priest because of his formation of a Battle Circle, where his clone trainees engaged in deadly fights. Gilamar, who also served as a doctor, had to treat Priest's injured trainees and saw many that were beyond treatment and later died.
            A few months after the formation of the Galactic Empire, Priest, along with his girlfriend Isabet Reau, were part of the resurgent Death Watch. The pair were stationed on Mandalore and were actively working with the Imperial garrison. When Gilamar and Kal's adopted son Ordo Skirata encountered Priest in the city of Keldabe, Priest tried to recruit Gilamar into joining the Death Watch. Upon confirming his belief that Priest was still intent in having the Mandalorians rebuild their old empire, Gilamar stabbed Priest with a knife above his thigh, slashing through Priest's femoral artery and causing massive blood loss. Priest died quickly and his body was disposed of by Gilamar and Ordo who threw his body into the Kelita River.
            Dred Priest was a male Human Mandalorian and part of the one hundred training sergeants, known as the Cuy'val Dar, that bounty hunter Jango Fett selected to help train clone commandos on the planet of Kamino. Priest accepted the invitation and relished the challenge that creating elite soldiers offered. During his stay at Kamino, he secretly formed a Battle Circle with Isabet Reau—a female Cuy'val Dar whom he soon started a relationship with—where they forced their trainees to fight each other in brutal competitions. Due to the injuries suffered by the clone trainees, Mij Gilamar—another Cuy'val Dar and the doctor who treated the injured clones— informed Fett of the situation, who put a violent end to Priest's fight club. Despite that incident and their Death Watch leanings, Fett allowed them to stay as he was more concerned of their training results.
            In 18 BBY, shortly after the end of the Clone Wars and the formation of the Galactic Empire, Priest and Reau were seen on the planet Mandalore working with the local Imperial garrison and recruiting for the revived Death Watch. Priest ran into Gilamar and Null-ARC Ordo Skirata, and tried to convince them to join the Death Watch. They led him down into an underground chasm where they talked further. Upon realizing that Priest had not changed and was still firm in his belief of establishing a Mandalorian empire with the Death Watch, Gilamar stabbed him in the leg with his knife, severing his femoral artery and swiftly killing Priest from severe blood loss. Gilamar and Skirata tossed his corpse into the churning Kelita River to both delay Reau from discovering his fate and to hide who really killed him.
            Dred Priest was a firm believer in the Mandalorians ruling the galaxy like their forebears of old. Mij Gilamar described Priest as a merciless butcher, making his trainees fight each other on the battle circle for his amusement.
            Priest had a thin face with a lopsided mouth, the sort of face one could punch all day, according to Kal Skirata.
            This figure uses parts from 2004's Vintage Original Trilogy Collection Boba Fett's arms and legs, along with a new head, belt, and torso.
            Like the Rav Bralor figure in the set, Dred Priest appears to be loosely based on artwork done by Tom Hodges for the Star Wars Insider 86 article The Mandalorians: People and Culture. In this picture you can see that the waist and shoulder ammo belts, cod piece, and upper torso armor are identical. However, the helmet on the action figure is not as intricately painted as the one in the artwork, nor does the action figure have any thigh and shin armor. The legs are taken from a Boba Fett action figure.
            The head under the helmet is loosely based on Hasbro employee Derryl Depriest, whose name also served as a basis for the figure.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dred_Priest</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDredPriest</string></dict>

        <key>Ajunta Pall</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.434.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ajunta Pall was a male Human Jedi Master and the leader of the Dark Jedi that were exiled from the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic following the Hundred-Year Darkness. Upon his arrival on Korriban, he became the first Dark Lord of the Sith. He was regarded as the manifestation of Typhojem, the Left-Handed God by the Kissai.[2][3] Long after his death, his spirit was redeemed by the Jedi Knight Revan during the Jedi Civil War.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Ajunta Pall was a member of the Jedi Order following the First Great Schism. Undergoing training in the ways of the Force, Pall first attained the rank of Jedi Knight, then attained the rank of Jedi Master and began studying the ways of alchemy. Eventually through his studies, Master Pall discovered the secret of creating and shaping life; fearful of this power, the Order deemed it an abomination of the Force and sought to erase all practice of it. The Jedi High Council barred the teachings of Pall and his followers, deeming him a pawn of the dark side of the Force.[4]
            Angered by what they deemed Jedi arrogance, Master Pall and his followers declared war on the Order, beginning a century-long conflict that would be known to history as the Hundred-Year Darkness. Obtaining significant power, the now High General Pall slew more than a dozen Jedi during the final battle of the war on Corbos, but he and his fellow Dark Jedi were defeated nonetheless. Captured by his former comrades in the Jedi Order, Master Pall and his followers were stripped of their ranks and their weapons and exiled from space controlled by the Galactic Republic.[5]
            Traveling from one planet to the other in search of a habitable world, the Exiles eventually discovered Korriban on the Outer Rim. Venturing out into the wastes of the desert planet, the Exiles were intrigued upon discovering the world was home to a Force-sensitive species known as the Sith, who, while relatively primitive when compared to the Dark Jedi, were quite creative in their knowledge of the Force. The Sith, under their King Hakagram Graush, initially resisted the Dark Jedi's attempt to obtain their knowledge and subjugate them; however, Pall managed to recruit the King's Shadow Hand to their side, with the result that Graush was betrayed to the Dark Jedi, and Pall personally executed Graush with his own sword. Afterwards, the Sith species, in awe of Pall and his followers' ships and technology, as well as their skills in manipulating the Force, quickly came to worship the visitors to their planet, hailing them as their gods. Pall and his followers then subjugated the natives, and his new Sith subjects revered him as their "Jen'ari," meaning "Dark Lord."[6][1][5]
            As the first Dark Lord of the Sith, Ajunta Pall founded the first Sith Empire and expanded it onto other worlds. The Sith took over the planet Ziost and created it as their capital and as Pall's new home. Pall eventually died after serving the Empire for many decades, but his Empire lived on. His body was returned to Korriban, where it was placed in a massive tomb in what would come to be called the Valley of the Dark Lords.[5]
            After his physical death, Ajunta Pall's spirit persisted within his tomb, having attached his soul to the physical world through his extensive knowledge of alchemy. Over the centuries, he began to question his actions as a Sith Lord and the downfall the Lords experienced at each other's hand.[1]
            Millennia after his death, during the Jedi Civil War, Jedi Knight Revan entered Ajunta Pall's tomb to retrieve the Sith Lord's sword so that he could gain prestige from the nearby Sith academy, which he hoped would ultimately lead to his accessing a Star Map containing partial coordinates of the Star Forge. Ajunta Pall appeared as a spirit and told Revan of his actions as a Sith, with disappointment and shame, telling him of how the Jedi weren't what drove the Sith to destruction after the Hundred-Year Darkness. Pall explained how the Sith themselves battled each other and led their Order close to death and that he felt nothing but remorse. Revan removed the Dark Lord's blade and convinced Pall to turn away from the dark side and return to the light.[1] Letting go of his pain and anguish, Pall returned to the light and became one with the Force, finding peace at last.[7] It is said that Revan gave the sword to Master Uthar Wynn at the academy, obtaining the prestige necessary to reach the Star Map.[source?]
            Before his spirit was finished, Pall hinted at a secret source of Sith power. He was unable to reconcile conflicted images of whether Revan had discovered this source of power, or would soon do so.[1]
            Ajunta Pall's tomb is one of the side quests available in the Korriban segment of the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. In the game, he recognizes the player character's true identity. The main character can either help him become one with the Force (for "light-side points"), fight him and destroy his spirit (for "dark-side points"), or fail to take him to the light and let his spirit fade away. The player may also choose to keep the sword instead of giving it to Uthar.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ajunta_Pall</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAjuntaPall</string></dict>

        <key>Firmus Piett</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.438.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Firmus Piett, a human male native to Axxila, was an Imperial officer who served in the naval forces of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. At the time of the Battle of Hoth, he served as first officer of the Star Dreadnought Executor—flagship of the Sith Lord Darth Vader—assisting Admiral Kendal Ozzel. After Ozzel committed a fatal mistake during the hunt for the Rebel Alliance, Piett was promoted to admiral and given command of Vader's flagship. Piett served in that capacity until the Battle of Endor, where he served as a Fleet Admiral, when the Imperial Navy confronted the Rebel Fleet around the second Death Star battle station in the year 4 ABY. The admiral perished aboard his starship when Arvel Crynyd's A-wing starfighter crashed into the Executor's bridge.
            Born a male human, Firmus Piett hailed from Axxila, a planet located in the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy. At some point, Piett joined the starfleet of Palpatine's Galactic Empire, and rose through the ranks.[1] As a junior officer under the command of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, he attended the planet Jelucan's introduction ceremony into the Galactic Empire, following its conquest eight years after the Clone Wars.[8]
            By 3 ABY,[2] Piett had been made a captain. He was stationed on the Executor, a Super Star Destroyer that acted as the flagship of Darth Vader, the right-hand man of Emperor Sheev Palpatine himself. The mission of Vader's personal fleet of Star Destroyers, the Death Squadron, was to search the galaxy for the Rebel Alliance's secret base.[6]
            On the Executor, Piett was subordinate to Admiral Kendal Ozzel, whom he saw as a pompous and incompetent officer.[4] Piett was notably tasked with collecting and analyzing data sent by Imperial probe droids looking for traces of the Rebels. When information came in from a probe exploring the Hoth system, Piett called out to Admiral Ozzel while Vader was present on the bridge. Vader recognized the information as a solid lead on the location of the Rebel headquarters, and he ordered the Death Squadron to set course for the icy world of Hoth.[6]
            However, Admiral Ozzel made a complete mess of the Death Squadron's approach to Hoth, taking the ships out of hyperspace too close to the system. As the Rebels were now aware of the Empire's presence, they were able to erect a defense shield over their base, preventing any orbital bombardment. Captain Piett stood at Ozzel's side when Darth Vader force choked the admiral. With Ozzel dead, the Emperor's right-hand man promoted Captain Piett to admiral at that moment. Piett's first action as an admiral of the Imperial Navy was to order the disposal of his predecessor's corpse.[6]
            Thanks to the intervention of General Veers' ground force, the Empire managed to get the upper hand on Hoth, forcing the Rebels to evacuate. Despite the orbital blockade imposed by the Death Squadron, many enemy ships managed to fall through the cracks under the cover fire from the Rebel's planetary ion cannon. Subsequently, Admiral Piett was ordered to track one of the fleeing ships, the Millennium Falcon. With that vessel and its crew of Han Solo, Leia Organa, C-3PO, and Chewbacca as bait, Vader was confident he could lure Luke Skywalker into a trap.[6]
            Under Piett's command, the Executor then engaged in the pursuit of the Millennium Falcon.[6] One of the bridge crew that served under his command during the pursuit was Lieutenant Commander Ciena Ree.[8] When it transpired that the Rebel craft was hiding in the Hoth system's asteroid field, the admiral was concerned that debris would cause significant damage to Death Squadron's vessels. Vader, however, ignored Piett's advice, ordering the fleet to enter the asteroid field. True to his words, the asteroid field brutally punished the Imperial fleet with repeated meteor impacts, destroying at least one Star Destroyer and causing significant damage. In a holographic conference with Vader and the commanders of the other Destroyers, one of whom was killed during the meeting when his Destroyer was obliterated, Captain Needa voiced his belief that the rebel ship must logically have been destroyed considering the damage they had taken, but Vader insisted that they were still alive and ordered him to keep searching. Shortly thereafter, Piett joined the conference after receiving word that Emperor Palpatine himself demanded to speak with his right hand man, informing Vader. On Vader's orders, he moved the Executor out of the asteroid field, in hopes of sending a clear transmission.[6]
            To Admiral Piett's discreet distaste, Vader later assembled a motley crew of bounty hunters on the Executor's bridge, enlisting them in his track for the Millennium Falcon.[6]
            Later, Admiral Piett assembled a group of Imperial officers including the now-Commander Ciena Ree and her friend Nash Windrider for a patrol in the outer edge of the planet Hudalla's ring. In private, Piett told Commander Ree that there were rebel spies in the planetary ring. He tasked her with ensuring that at least one of the pilots escaped into hyperspace. During the dogfight, Ciena and Nash encountered their former fellow cadet Thane Kyrell, who had joined the Rebel Alliance's Corona Squadron. Since she still loved Thane, Ciena ensured that he and most of Corona Squadron escaped into hyperspace. Following the mission, the TIE fighter pilots were reprimanded for their failure to destroy all the rebel ships. However, Piett discreetly nodded at Ciena to thank her for following his orders. Ciena later learned that the dogfight was part of an Imperial plan to lure the rebels into a trap at Endor.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Firmus_Piett</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFirmusPiett</string></dict>
        <key>Petro</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.439.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Petro was a human male Jedi Youngling who served the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars. Prior to the end of the conflict, he participated in an ancient Jedi rite of passage, known as The Gathering, to find a kyber crystal—the key component to the lightsaber he would construct after his visit to the planet Ilum.
            Petro was born on Corellia and being Force-sensitive, he was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to begin his Jedi training and learn the ways of the Force.
            Being amongst the top of his class, Petro was one of six younglings (along with Ganodi, Byph, Katooni, Zatt and Gungi) selected to travel to the sacred planet Ilum to take part in the ancient Jedi ritual known as The Gathering.[2]
            Following the successful nature of the Gathering, Petro and his fellow younglings returned to the Crucible, where Petro demonstrated a technique, seemingly of his own invention that he described as the Whirlwind of Destiny. Under the guidance of Professor Huyang, an Architect droid who had been teaching Jedi how to build a lightsaber for more than a thousand years, He showed different models of lightsabers and asked them to visualize what kind of lightsaber they wanted to build so that they could complete the construction of their lightsaber. Petro was the first one to finish building his saber and told Zatt that with his lightsaber, he would challenge Obi-Wan Kenobi to a duel and kill General Grievous. But after Huyang examined it, He noted that that the only person that Petro would kill would be himself as Petro incorrectly assembled his lightsaber because he inverted the emitter matrix which would cause the power grid to backfire. Huyang stated that if Petro tried to activate his lightsaber now that the only thing that would be left of him and his lightsaber would be his Crystal. Huyang told Petro to start over and to follow the diagram.[5]
            But before Petro or any of the Younglings could finish constructing their lightsaber, they were attacked by Hondo Ohnaka and his pirate gang.[5]
            Petro, along with some of his fellow younglings were outside of the temple training with their lightsabers under Jedi Master Tera Sinube, when they witnessed a duel between Anakin Skywalker and Barriss Offee, who was the real culprit behind the Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar and the framing of Ahsoka Tano. When Barriss kicked Anakin off the roof of a building they were dueling on, he fell to where the Younglings were training. Master Sinube immediately activated his lightsaber to defend himself and the younglings if need be. Petro quickly warned Anakin to look out when Barriss leaped down to strike at Anakin. Anakin was able then to defeat Barriss and take her into custody.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Petro</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPetro</string></dict>

        <key>Sate Pestage</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.441.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sate Pestage (pronounced /seɪt pɛs'tadʒ/)[3] was a longtime Human male advisor and right-hand man to Palpatine, and one of the few people who truly knew him. Serving Palpatine from his days as a senator on Naboo to his ascension to Emperor, Pestage rose alongside him, becoming an advisor to Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor, and then Grand Vizier of the Galactic Empire.
            During the time of the Galactic Republic, Pestage did much of Palpatine's covert work, from espionage to murder. As Grand Vizier, he controlled the day-to-day operations of the Empire by the time of the Battle of Hoth. He also served as Palpatine's assistant, managing his schedule, screening his calls, and overseeing his personal affairs.
            After Palpatine's death at the Battle of Endor, and as the highest surviving member of the Imperial Court, Pestage assumed control of Coruscant and the Empire as the Interim-Emperor. However, the other Imperial Advisors turned on him, as did members of the military and Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard. To save his life, Pestage made a deal with the New Republic to turn over Coruscant in exchange for immunity and planetary holdings. Isard closed on him, though, and Pestage was executed by Admiral Delak Krennel. However, the vizier was also said to have gone to Byss and died there; it was believed that one of these two Pestages was a clone.
            Pestage was born in the city of Daplona on Ciutric IV, and eventually moved to Coruscant, a planet he came to call home and whose "every nook and cranny" he claimed to know.[1]
            The obscurity of Pestage's origins, as well as his closeness to Palpatine, fueled rumors in the late Imperial era that he and the Emperor were related, with some saying that Pestage was one of Palpatine's first clones, produced during his early rise to power, others that he was Palpatine's son by some forgotten wedding of convenience, who aged normally while the Emperor kept himself rejuvenated.[7] Despite these unfounded rumors, it was known that Pestage had a large family of his own residing in the Ciutric Hegemony,[5] and there was no evidence of any genetic connection between the two men.
            Pestage and Palpatine first met in a small plaza beside the Parnelli Art Museum on Naboo in 52 BBY, when Palpatine was still an Ambassador and a Sith apprentice to Darth Plagueis. It was for the latter, under his guise of Hego Damask, Magister of Damask Holdings, that Pestage worked at the time, carrying out covert and illicit assignments, and he had chosen Pestage to arrange for the assassination of senator Vidar Kim, so that Palpatine could succeed him. The power Palpatine offered Pestage was enough to bring him to the Ambassador's side. In spite of this, he was unaware that they were Sith Lords until he witnessed the both of them destroying a group of Maladian assassins.[1]
            After the plaza meeting, Sate Pestage had became[4] Palpatine's right-hand man ever since the latter first came to Coruscant as the Senator for Naboo.[9][10] Pestage first entered the public eye some years before the Battle of Naboo, while serving alongside Kinman Doriana, with whom he became close friends, as one of Senator Palpatine's aides. During the term of King Ars Veruna, Pestage was responsible for covering up the illegal activities the Senator engaged in on his homeworld.[3]
            One such mission occurred in 36 BBY, when a Gungan named Kroke Modbom was arrested by the Royal Naboo Security Forces. Pestage came to Naboo on behalf of Palpatine to take custody of Kroke, claiming the Gungan was guilty of murder and treason. While there, Pestage was introduced to a lieutenant in the Security Forces named Quarsh Panaka. Later that day, while pursuing a suspect, Panaka discovered a secret network of tunnels filled with several decomposing bodies and, according to the suspect, records of corruption in the government. Pestage arrived at the site soon after, having heard Panaka's comm call for help, and retrieved a lockbox filled with evidence. When Panaka's suspect attempted to escape, Pestage interceded and shot him to prevent him from talking to the authorities. Panaka suspected Pestage of being involved in the murders of the bodies he had found and wanted to place him under arrest, even though Pestage had diplomatic immunity. However, Panaka's superior allowed the whole matter to be covered up, and Pestage returned to Coruscant the next day.[4]
            Pestage accompanied Senator Palpatine to events from social affairs to Senate meetings in the Rotunda, in the latter of which he was sometimes assigned to carry messages between Palpatine and the Sergeant at Arms. Shortly before the Battle of Naboo, Pestage joined Palpatine in a meeting with several other senators at the Coruscant Opera, during which they discussed the shortcomings of Chancellor Finis Valorum. Since Palpatine did not wish his opinions on the Chancellor to be overheard, Pestage thoroughly checked the noise-canceling containment field of the box, an act that impressed Passel Argente. When Palpatine wished to meet with Eru Matalis, the leader of the terrorist organization Nebula Front, Pestage unearthed information on him for the senator, and was present when the two men met.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sate_Pestage/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSatePestage</string></dict>

            In 14 ABY, Penin, along with other Jedi students, was heading to the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 onboard a shuttle. In the ship, he met Jaden Korr, and the two eventually developed a friendship. Their shuttle was soon attacked by the Disciples of Ragnos and forced to crash-land, though the attack later proved to be merely a diversion so that the cultists could access Luke Skywalker's personal records in the Massassi temple.
            After recovering from the shuttle crash, Penin and Korr teamed up in order to reach the temple. They fought hostile howlers in the rainforest: Penin was shooting with a blaster pistol while Korr was using his lightsaber. After witnessing stormtroopers patrolling the perimeter of the Temple, Korr went on ahead alone and quickly dispatched them, along with a Sith Cultist but was then knocked unconscious with the Scepter of Ragnos by Tavion Axmis. Penin then went for help and brought Luke Skywalker and Kyle Katarn back with him, but the Disciples of Ragnos' forces were already gone.
            Penin and Korr soon were both assigned Katarn as their Master and began Jedi training. During their very first training exercise, Rosh set a lightsaber training droid to attack Jaden in order to distract him and finish the training course first. His plan succeeded and Jaden fell behind, but, at end of the course, Katarn chastised Penin, saying the droid would have killed Korr had it been set to Luke's training regimen. Penin apologized to his fellow student, an apology which Korr accepted.
            Penin often felt that Katarn was holding him back, and as a result grew arrogant and impatient. Eventually, Penin was assigned to investigate Byss, where he was captured by the Disciples of Ragnos. At first, he was afraid he would be killed, but instead of killing him, they took advantage of his fear to convert him to the dark side. Penin's naiveté and lust for power made it easy for the Cult to turn him, and he became an apprentice to Axmis, leader of the Disciples of Ragnos.
            On Vjun, Penin, Axmis, and the Kothos twins led the Cult's operations in Bast Castle in order to siphon the Force energies that were stored there. Katarn and Korr arrived on Vjun, intent on stopping the cultists, but were separated. Korr later located and confronted Penin in Vader's throne room, where Penin, with the aid of the twins, dueled Korr.
            Penin and Korr were evenly matched until Korr managed to kill the twins. He soon after disarmed Penin just as Katarn arrived. Before they were able to apprehend Penin, Axmis intervened. She disabled Katarn and Korr with Force lightning, and afterward revealed that she had taken Penin as her new apprentice. Axmis ripped Korr's lightsaber from him with the Force, threw it at the ceiling and brought the weakened structure down on the Jedi with the Scepter of Ragnos. She then used the ensuing chaos to escape with Penin in tow. Katarn used the Force to prevent the ceiling from crashing down on top of them while Korr used Katarn's lightsaber to create an exit.
            Some time later, Penin repented and tried to turn away from the dark side while on Taspir III with Alora, Tavion's other apprentice. He sent a distress signal to the Jedi Praxeum. Katarn and Korr arrived on Taspir III and began searching for Penin.
            Korr eventually located Penin, who begged for forgiveness for attacking Korr on Vjun, and admitted that his fear was what made him fall to the dark side. As Penin did not appear to need any obvious assistance, Korr's anger at Penin revealed itself once again, and he came close to striking down his friend. Katarn communicated with Korr through the Force and pleaded with Korr to deactivate his lightsaber.
            Korr relented, though Alora, who had been watching from a distance, then attacked the pair. As one of her opening attacks, Alora severed Penin's entire left arm due to his disloyalty, after which Korr struck her down in battle. Katarn arrived soon after, which proved to be timely as Penin went into shock, and his Master rushed him back to the Praxeum for treatment.
            While there, Penin tested his new prosthetic left arm which looked identical to his original severed arm, and was greeted by Luke Skywalker, who expressed hope that Penin's experience with the dark side had taught him the patience and humility that one day would turn him into a great Jedi. Penin gratefully accepted the Jedi Master's words of encouragement.
            Penin possessed a yellow-bladed lightsaber as a Jedi. When he turned to the dark side, he used a red-bladed lightsaber.
            Prior to joining the Jedi Praxeum, Rosh Penin was enthusiastic about becoming a Jedi, but grew arrogant and impatient during his training under Kyle Katarn. He came to believe that Katarn was holding him back from reaching his full potential and did not appreciate his talents.
            For a time, Penin saw his friend Jaden Korr as a rival and would try to best him during their lessons. He turned to the dark side out of fear for his life when confronted by the Disciples of Ragnos, and embraced the power of the dark side, but eventually realized his mistake and returned to the light. He was accepted back into the Academy and heeded Luke Skywalker's advice about patience and humility.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rosh_Penin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRoshPenin</string></dict>

        <key>The Shroud</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.446.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The man known only as the Shroud was a Human male who was a legendary freelance spy active years before the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. After a lengthy career that included acts such as the Great Czerka Datacrash, he eventually went underground and was widely considered a myth by the year 3639 BBY, when he was approached by the Hutt Cartel. At some point around the Eternal Empire's conquest, the Shroud was killed by Z0-0M, who assumed his identity.
            The organization, constructed by Shroud by the year 3639 BBY was quite remarkable. He employed numerous battle droids of various design as well as many trusted lieutenants of several species. The Shroud and his men installed listening outposts on every major battlefield of the Galactic War, from Balmorra and Taris to Corellia and Hoth. The listening devices allowed Shroud to spy on any communications in the area, including those of the Empire and Republic, and were usually installed in extremely hard to reach locations, so that in case of discovery the listening devices could not be dismantled easily. In addition to the listening posts, the Shroud deployed MCR-99 reconnaissance droids to every planet he considered notable, including such closely guarded worlds as Tython and Korriban. In addition to his main base of operations on Nar Shaddaa, Shroud had his lieutenants posted at several hidden bases, spread from the capital worlds such as Dromund Kaas and Coruscant to the supposedly secret prison planet Belsavis. The bases' entrances were obscured and the inner workings possesses multiple levels of lethal defense systems, to the point of redundancy.
            The Shroud was hired to spy on the Republic and the Empire by the Hutts in the lead-up to their invasion of the planet Makeb, but the Shroud soon discovered weaknesses in both governments that would allow him to attack their capitals by launching dreadnaughts straight into Coruscant and Dromund Kaas. Using his significant funds, The Shroud bought both a Harrower-class dreadnought and a Valor-class cruiser, and planted hyperspace beacons inside Kaas City and Galactic City.
            One of Shroud‘s lieutenants, Evie Bo, was horrified by the Shroud's plan and fled to the Empire, taking a number of the Shroud's specially-designed EV2 discreet reconnaissance macrobinoculars with her. News of Bo's defection also allowed the Republic Strategic Information Service's Agent Deena Riss to learn bits of Shroud's plans and procure another copy of the special macrobinoculars. Riss on the Republic side and Darth Mortis on the Imperial side recruited the best agents available to track down Shroud's lieutenants and fold his plans.
            When the Shroud first discovered intruders in one of his secret bases, he was extremely underwhelmed, even encouraging the opposition to continue their search for him, confident that it wound end in vain. However, as Republic and Imperial operatives discovered more of Shroud's listening outposts and bases, he grew more and more aggravated with their actions, to the point of direct taunts over the holocomm. Eventually, the Shroud was tracked to his largest and best protected base, located on Nar Shaddaa. In his personally designed control room, the Shroud made a stand and at one point during the fight employed holographic duplicates to confuse his enemies. Eventually, the Shroud was defeated and the attacks on Coruscant and Dromund Kaas were stopped. Confident of their success, the Shroud's pursuers left his body on the floor and departed his lair to rendezvous with their respective mission controls. The Shroud, however, escaped certain death by putting one of his duplicates in his place at the last moment. He made a taunting holocall to Deena Riss and inflicted his punishment on the defector Evie Bo. The Shroud interrupted her conversation with Darth Mortis and whispered a single word - "asunder" - that triggered the neural scrambler secretly implanted in Evie's brain. She remained completely healthy physically, but all of her memories and personality were gone, leaving her a blank slate to be used by the Empire and preventing her from revealing any more of the Shroud's secrets. Despite the failure of his plans, the Shroud continued to oversee his extensive spy network in the galaxy.
            The Shroud later became curious regarding the clandestine meeting between Republic Colonel Rian Darok and Darth Arkous of the Dark Council with the blessing of the Order of Shasa. Knowing that the Order follows doctrine of the late Revan, he began noting unusual occurrences with his field agents, such as Asset R-27, who was intercepted by an Imperial stealth craft so far into Republic territory. Suspecting that the Order of Revan was rising out of obscurity, the Shroud ordered his agents to gather information on the Order.
            In the years following the Eternal Empire's conquest of the galaxy, the Shroud had his MCR-X reconnaissance droids monitor the massive Star Fortresses placed above key worlds suppressing rebellion. When the Outlander was in the midst of attacking one of these Star Fortresses, they spotted one of these droids with their macrobinoculars, with a coded message from the Shroud saying he was glad the Outlander had returned and he would be watching.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shroud</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTheShroud</string></dict>
        <key>Gilad Pellaeon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.447.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gilad Pellaeon, nicknamed Gil, was a dedicated Human male naval officer, serving for seven decades in the fleets of the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, Imperial Remnant, and Galactic Alliance, and rose to the position of supreme commander for the latter two governments. He began his career in the Republic's Judicial Forces, where he ascended the ranks and captained the assault ship Leveler during the Clone Wars. Pellaeon developed a strong attachment to the navy as an institution, and when the Republic became the Empire, he continued serving aboard the Star Destroyer Chimaera.
            At the Battle of Endor, the Chimaera fell under Pellaeon's command, and he issued the retreat order. Captain Pellaeon remained one of the fleet's more prominent officers until the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who selected the Chimaera as his flagship and made Pellaeon his right-hand man. Pellaeon grew to respect and admire Thrawn throughout the Grand Admiral's campaign against the New Republic, but when Thrawn was assassinated at the Battle of Bilbringi, Pellaeon again was forced to call a retreat. After Thrawn's death and the failed return of Palpatine, the Empire crumbled around Pellaeon. He found himself serving as the second-in-command of the warlord Treuten Teradoc, but when Admiral Natasi Daala shared with him her vision of rebuilding the Empire and ending warlordism, he defected to her and played a key role in forming the Imperial Remnant.
            Upon Daala's defeat at Yavin 4, she turned command of the Remnant over to Admiral Pellaeon, making him Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet. He rebuilt the fleet and fought a series of campaigns against the New Republic, but was frequently driven back as the Remnant's resources shriveled. In 19 ABY, He finally accepted that the only way for the Empire to survive was through a peace treaty, and forced the Council of Moffs to accept a truce with the New Republic. When the Imperial capital fell to the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders years later, Pellaeon played on the Imperial fleet's absolute loyalty to him to overcome the old-line Moffs' resistance and join the newly formed Galactic Alliance, leading a series of victories over the Yuuzhan Vong.
            At the war's close, Pellaeon retired, but returned to serve as the supreme commander of the Galactic Alliance Defense Force when his predecessor Sien Sovv was killed. In that capacity, Pellaeon led the Galactic Alliance through the Swarm War and the early stages of the Second Galactic Civil War before once more retiring. He returned to service as the head of state of the Imperial Remnant, but died in 41 ABY at Fondor, assassinated by Tahiri Veila when he refused to support Darth Caedus's faction of the Galactic Alliance.
            Gilad Pellaeon was born in 51 BBY on Corellia, where he stayed long enough to develop memories of his homeworld.[1][2] However, Pellaeon spent the majority of his formative years on Coruscant, the capital of the Galactic Republic. Pellaeon did not care for the ecumenopolis, however, and always enjoyed departing it, having never considered it his home.[1] Pellaeon was eager to become an officer[4] in the armed forces of the Republic, and to that end he sought to enter the prestigious Raithal Academy.[12] Not yet being old enough to enter, Pellaeon persuaded a slicer to alter his records before he submitted his application to the Academy around 36 BBY, when he was fifteen years old. The Academy never discovered Pellaeon's deception,[10] and he was accepted. Pellaeon performed respectably but without distinction at the Academy,[13] sharing his class with Dren Jamer.[14] Pellaeon ultimately graduated with honors[12] in the top third of his class[13] and entered the Judicial Forces[10] as an ensign.[1]
            Upon his graduation,[4] Pellaeon served in his first command assignment[13] as an ensign aboard an escort craft for a convoy near Gavryn.[4] When pirates attacked the convoy of transport vessels while it was entering Gavryn's orbit, Pellaeon evaded capture and disrupted the pirate ship's sensors by flying his vessel into the planet's magnetic pole. Pellaeon then attacked and destroyed the pirate craft when it moved to board the other ships in the convoy.[13] Pellaeon earned a rapid series of promotions for his quick thinking in the incident at Gavryn[4] and received commendations for fighting pirates, eventually participating in efforts to combat pirate activity throughout the galaxy.[12]
            As of 27 BBY, Pellaeon was placed high enough to hear rumors of the Outbound Flight Project, but not highly enough to know much about it.[9] Pellaeon had an eye for women, and pursued a series of casual relationships and rendezvouses. Such relationships were considered unsuitable by his superiors, and kept him from promotion into the admiralty.[15] As of 22 BBY,[16] Pellaeon was in a relationship with Hallena Devis, a Republic Intelligence spy with whom Pellaeon was highly enamored. Each kept their relationship secret, and they spent time together whenever they could. Pellaeon kept a private yacht, and sometimes took her sailing on it.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gilad_Pellaeon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGiladPellaeon</string></dict>
        <key>Voss Parck</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.448.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Voss Parck was an individual who served as a captain in the Galactic Empire's navy, commanding the Venator-class Star Destroyer Strikefast. While leading a scouting party on an uncharted world, Parck encountered the Chiss warrior Mitth'raw'nuruodo. Despite a hostile initial encounter, Parck managed to capture and make contact with Thrawn with the help of the Imperial cadet Eli Vanto. Parck's actions in bringing Thrawn to the Emperor set in motion a series of events that would result in the Chiss becoming a Grand Admiral, one of the highest ranks in the Empire.
            Voss Parck was an Imperial Navy Captain from the Core Worlds who commanded the Venator-class Star Destroyer Strikefast. During the early Imperial Era, Captain Parck was returning a group of Imperial cadets to the Myomar Academy in the Expansion Region when they were sidetracked by a smuggling pursuit which led them to an uncharted planet bordering the Unknown Regions. After Colonel Mosh Barris discovered a small hut and eight rectangular boxes, he contacted Captain Parck to send a scouting party in accordance with the Empire's Unknown Alien protocols. Parck traveled to the site of the hut in a shuttle with eleven Imperial cadets from the Myomar Academy including Cadet First Class Eli Vanto, a Wild Spacer who was seemingly destined for a career as a supply officer.[2]
            Due to Vanto's knowledge of languages, he deduced that the writing on the rectangular boxes was a variant of Sy Bisti, a trade language used in both Wild Space and the Unknown Regions. Vanto informed Parck that the rectangular boxes were shipping containers from a company called "Red Bype" or "Redder Bype." Suspecting that they had made contact with an unknown alien species, Parck ordered Colonel Barris' troops to set up camp and to wait the arrival of a tech analysis team. Shortly later, Captain Parck and Colonel Barris were informed by Major Wyan that one of the V-wing starfighters had crashed on the uncharted world. While Barris went to check the crash site, Captain Parck stayed behind with Cadet Vanto to translate the Sy Bisti writings.[2]
            Shortly later, Colonel Barris and an Imperial Navy trooper returned with the V-wing pilot's flight suit, which had been stuffed with grass, leaves, and red berries. Captain Parck ordered Colonel Barris to expand their search for the pilot's body. When Parck observed Barris' nervousness, the Colonel revealed that his men had found that the V-wing's blaster, space power packs, and concussion grenades were missing. Facing the prospect of armed primitives, Parck allowed Barris and his men to search until dark and to resume in the morning. Parck wanted to avoid friendly fire incidents in unknown terrain but kept aerial patrols of the crash site. Before returning to the Strikefast to arrange for a wider starfighter cover, he ordered Cadet Vanto to remain with Colonel Barris' team to study the settlement and search for anymore inscriptions.[2]
            In Captain Parck's absence, Colonel Barris' search party was harried that night by an unknown assailant, resulting in the deaths of five Imperial Navy troopers and one stormtrooper. The mysterious assailant used the V-wing pilot's stolen equipment to terrorize the Imperials, spooking Colonel Barris. Against Captain Parck's orders, Colonel Barris brought the entire Imperial landing party back to the Strikefast along with the alien settlement. Captain Parck summoned Barris and Vanto to the hangar bay control tower and ordered the rest to report for debriefing. Parck believed that the unknown assailant had stowed aboard and decided to test this hypothesis. He ordered that the hangar bay's lights be turned off and the chamber sealed.[2]
            As Parck had predicted, the unknown assailant slipped out of the landing party's troop transport and tried to hide in a Zeta-class shuttle. Under Captain Parck's orders, Imperial stormtroopers apprehended the intruder, who identified himself as the Chiss warrior Mitth'raw'nuruodo. Due to his knowledge of Sy Bisti, Parck allowed Vanto to serve as a translator while he questioned the alien. Cadet Vanto also explained to Parck about the Wild Space legends surrounding the Chiss. Under questioning, Thrawn explained that he had attacked Barris' men by claiming that he had been exiled by his people and that he had been trying to return home.[2]
            Parck then steered the topic towards how Thrawn had run circles around Colonel Barris's men. Thrawn admitted undressing the dead V-wing pilot and planting pyussh berries in his flight suit in order to lure small animals into the camp. Thrawn also acknowledged crashing a second V-wing fighter by planting a monofilament line among the trees with the intent of stealing its comlink. Thrawn also admitted killing two stormtroopers in order to steal their armor and stow aboard the troop transport. When questioned by Parck, Thrawn claimed that he had been exiled by his people since he had carried out a preemptive strike against one of their foes. Following Thrawn's interrogation, Captain Parck ordered stormtroopers to escort Thrawn to the deck officer's office while suitable accommodations and refreshments were prepared.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Voss_Parck</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVossParck</string></dict>
        <key>Judder Page</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.449.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Judder Page was a Human male from Corulag who throughout his life served as a commando in the Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, New Republic, and Galactic Alliance. He was a nondescript-looking man who could easily blend into any crowd, traits that served him well on many missions that required stealth. Page was born to a wealthy Imperial senator and spent his youth training himself in various combat techniques before being sent to the Imperial Academy. After graduating with honors, Page briefly served in the Imperial Army, but had no love for the Empire and quickly defected to the Rebellion after hearing a passionate speech given by the Rebel leader Leia Organa to the Council of Galactic Rights. In his first years as a Rebel, Page served on the ground at the Battles of Hoth and Endor. Following the latter battle, he was given command of the Katarn Commandos, and he trained them to be an irregular and independent unit that was given a great deal of freedom in completing its mission objectives.
            Page led his commandos on many successful sabotage and retrieval missions throughout the early years of the New Republic, and in 8 ABY, struck at Kal'Shebbol, the fortress world of the Imperial warlord Moff Kentor Sarne. After he and his commandos took down the world's planetary shields, a New Republic task force was able to gain control of the planet. Sarne escaped with a potent new form of weapons technology, and Page organized an operation to pursue the rogue Imperial throughout the Kathol sector before he could become a serious threat to the galaxy. Although Page did not join the strike force, Sarne was defeated and his threat neutralized. The Katarn Commandos continued to serve the New Republic as an elite commando team, executing missions on planets such as Hettsk and Sarahwiee and at the Imperial Maw Installation.
            When the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy in 25 ABY, Page accepted a naval posting within the New Republic's successor state, the Galactic Alliance. He served aboard the Memory of Ithor, but the cruiser was destroyed by the enemy and its crew taken prisoner on Selvaris. Page and Commander Pash Cracken received vital intelligence while incarcerated at the prison compound and arranged for four inmates to escape and bring it to Galactic Alliance High Command. The information helped the Alliance rescue Page, Cracken, and a score of other prisoners, and Page was soon sent on a mission to Caluula to destroy a Yuuzhan Vong war coordinator. Shortly afterward, he led the Katarn Commandos onto enemy-held Coruscant, the former New Republic capital world, and joined a team of Jedi in storming the Citadel of the Yuuzhan Vong's Supreme Overlord Shimrra. They secured the fortress and the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker killed Shimrra, bringing the war to an end.
            The Human male[1] Judder[4] Page was born in 23 BBY on the planet Corulag.[1] When he was four years old, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Galactic Republic reorganized the galaxy's ruling body into a Galactic Empire and ordered the execution of the many members of the Jedi Order, a group of Force-using peacekeepers[5] who had been protecting the Republic for over a thousand generations.[6] Page's father became a wealthy senator in Palpatine's New Order, giving his son a pampered childhood. Page grew up hearing tales of the Jedi Knights and began idolizing the legendary group, despising his father for not possessing any of the traits that the Jedi had embodied. Although he was not Force-sensitive, Page committed himself to following in his heroes' footsteps and took advantage of his father's wealth to train himself in various combat techniques. While the children of other senators in the Empire's Core Worlds grew fat and lazy, Page honed his skills, unsure of what advantages they would bring him but content that he was staying active. His efforts were supported by his father, who supposed that Page's youthful idealism would eventually fade away.[1]
            Years later, Page's father sent his son to the Imperial Academy in order to put his combat training to use. Although Page had no desire to serve the Empire, he quickly discovered the vast avenues of study afforded to the son of a prominent Imperial senator and set himself to learning the theories of planetfall combat from the Empire's best teachers. He despised his instructors, but accepted their teachings and was groomed to be an officer. He graduated from the Academy with honors and was assigned to the Imperial Army, serving under General Veers[1] in a ground assault unit.[7] Around the same time, he was on leave and at the galactic capital of Coruscant when he heard a speech given by Senator Leia Organa of Alderaan. He found the younger woman beautiful and passionate, and he listened to a speech she gave to the Council of Galactic Rights. It was unlike any speech he had heard Imperial senators give before, most of which he had found sweet-coated and rambling. Organa spoke out against the Empire's positions on slavery and humanocentrism, and made several implicit references to the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a rebel movement that had recently begun stirring across the galaxy. Page, understanding the speech's hidden meaning, realized that the Alliance was the dream he had been following his entire life.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Judder_Page/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJudderPage</string></dict>

As the criminals escaped on board the craft, the Commander contacted the Imperial capital Coruscant and spoke with Lord Mas Amedda, who warned him there would be dire consequences if the shuttle was not recovered.[2]
            Emperor Palpatine dispatched Commodore Idel, Captain Conro, and Captain Shan to the Castell system to retrieve the Imperialis, with orders to destroy the shipyard for Pasqual's failure to keep the luxury yacht safe. Their Destroyers opened fire on the station, eliminating both it and Pasqual.[1]

        <key>Darth Sidious</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.452.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Sidious, a Force-sensitive human male, was the Dark Lord of the Sith and Galactic Emperor who ruled the galaxy from the fall of the Galactic Republic to the rise of the Galactic Empire. Rising to power in the Galactic Senate as Senator Sheev Palpatine, he was elected to the office of Supreme Chancellor and, during the Clone Wars, accumulated wartime powers in the name of security. As the Emperor, he dropped the facade of Palpatine, no longer needing to cultivate two identities, and henceforth ruled as Darth Sidious in thought and action. His machinations brought an end to the last era of peace in galactic history, replaced a millennium of democracy with New Order fascism, and restored the Sith to power through the destruction of the Jedi Order.
            A native of the Mid Rim planet Naboo, Sheev Palpatine was born around 84 BBY during the last century of the Galactic Republic. Inherently gifted with the Force, he became Darth Sidious during his apprenticeship under Darth Plagueis. But the Rule of Two dictated that only two Sith Lords could exist at any given time; therefore Sidious  killed his Sith Master and took Darth Maul as his first disciple in the dark side of the Force. As Palpatine, he cultivated a political career on the Core World Coruscant, serving as his homeworld's representative in the galactic capital. Driven by a desire for greater power, Sidious manipulated the Trade Federation into a dispute with the Royal House of Naboo, resulting in a chain of events that led to his election as Supreme Chancellor in 32 BBY. Taking Darth Tyranus as his new apprentice, Sidious spent a decade fomenting political unrest until entire star systems seceded from the Republic to form the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The ensuing Clone Wars commenced in 22 BBY, spreading conflict across the galaxy and strengthening Chancellor Palpatine's control of the government and military. When the Jedi moved to arrest him, having learned of his true identity, Sidious commanded the clone troopers to execute Order 66, turning the entire Grand Army of the Republic against its Jedi Generals. Shortly afterward, the Republic was officially reorganized into the First Galactic Empire, with Sidious becoming the self-proclaimed Emperor in 19 BBY. 
            The Emperor ruled the galaxy for a generation with Darth Vader as his last apprentice. His reign remained relatively unchallenged until the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic which, in turn, began the Galactic Civil War in 0 BBY. After the Death Star was destroyed, the Emperor sensed a disturbance in the Force and foresaw Luke Skywalker's potential to destroy him. During the construction of a new Death Star, the Emperor manipulated Skywalker into a confrontation with Vader, believing the Jedi aspirant could be turned like his father before him. However, the Emperor was confounded by Skywalker's refusal to join the Sith, causing Sidious to torture the young Jedi Knight with Force lightning. Affected by his son's compassion, Vader sacrificed his life by destroying the Emperor, and thus fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One in 4 ABY. 
            While Sidious had been defeated, the Empire would attempt to maintain the charade of his survival, while struggling to fill the void left by his absence. But Sidious had never intended to be replaced. Prior to his demise, he created the Contingency to seemingly destroy the Empire in the event of his death, propagating the idea that Sidious believed the Empire did not deserve to survive without its Emperor. As a consequence, the Imperial remnants were further weakened and less able to resist the New Republic during the waning days of the Galactic Civil War. Ultimately, the Empire capitulated the war after the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, ending the era founded by Darth Sidious. Following his death, Sidious' legacy became the base of what became the First Order, a hermit state led by Supreme Leader Snoke, who was also a practitioner of the dark side of the Force. The reign of Snoke would untimely end with his death at the hands of his own apprentice and Skywalker's grandson Kylo Ren, who succeeded his master as the new Supreme Leader, desiring to let the past die along with the Jedi and the Sith.
            A human male, Sheev Palpatine was born to a very influential family on the Mid Rim world of Naboo some 84 years prior to the Battle of Yavin.[3] As far as anyone knew, Palpatine had no family of which to speak.[11] At some point, during his youth, he met Darth Plagueis, a Dark Lord of the Sith, who took him as an apprentice with the name of Darth Sidious. As Sidious, he learned all his Master knew about the dark side of the Force, and all the Sith of Darth Bane's lineage had learned about the Force. He was also made aware of Plagueis's discovery of the secret to eternal life: his Master had learned to manipulate the midi-chlorians, and prevent people from dying. Plagueis's obsession with extending his own life eventually passed to Sidious, but he later admitted that he had never been able to learn his Master's secrets. In his public persona as Sheev Palpatine, he embarked on a career in politics and eventually, with the aid of his Master, ended up representing his homeworld in the Galactic Senate. With his rise to power guaranteed and his Master's instruction complete, Sidious killed Plagueis in his sleep, betraying him just as Sith apprentices in the past had always done with their Masters once their training was completed.[3][14][15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthSidious</string></dict>
        <key>Palo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.453.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Palo was a Human male from Naboo who served as a member of the Legislative Youth Program, along with Padmé Amidala. He and twelve-year-old Padmé had a brief relationship. However, they went their separate ways when Palo became an artist and Padmé continued in politics, although he never fully got over her.
            In 22 BBY, Amidala talked about Palo to her future husband, Anakin Skywalker, teasing the young Jedi by describing her first love in details with a suggestive tone of voice.
            For a time after 0 BBY, Palo was living in Moenia, continuing his career as an artist.
            In the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, Palo could be found at a gazebo in the city of Moenia on Naboo at the coordinates 4765, -4797. He gave three completable missions, but the text for them was bugged. He was eventually removed from the game by its developers relatively early in the game's lifespan.
            The character was originally set to return as Padmé Amidala's love interest for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode "Senate Spy". However, this idea was eventually abandoned when the crew remembered that Palo left politics to become an artist (as mentioned by Amidala in Attack of the Clones). The show's creators also felt that the relationship between Amidala and the "Senate Spy" character had to be more recent than the one between her and Palo, so that the theme of Anakin Skywalker's jealousy would be better supported. Palo was thus replaced by a new character, Rush Clovis.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Palo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPalo</string></dict>
        <key>Quarsh Panaka</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.454.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Quarsh Panaka, human male native to the planet Naboo, was a security forces captain who served the Royal House of Naboo during the final years of the Galactic Republic. When the Trade Federation invaded Naboo in 32 BBY, Panaka fled the planet, accompanying Queen Padmé Amidala to Tatooine and then Coruscant before ultimately returning to Naboo in order to liberate their homeworld. He later acquired the title of Moff during the rise of the Galactic Empire. He was assassinated by Saw Gerrera's partisans in 3 BBY.
            The human male Quarsh Panaka was born during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. He hailed from Naboo,[6] an idyllic planet that was inhabited by peaceful humans known as the Naboo, and a species of sentient amphibians called the Gungans.[8] In his youth, he gained combat experience in a Republic Special Task Force that fought against space pilots in his native Chommell sector. Eventually, he became Head of Security for the Royal House of Naboo, overseeing every branch of the volunteer Royal Naboo Security Forces,[6] namely the Palace Guard, the Security Guard, and the Space Fighter Corps.[9] He lived in his private residence in Theed.[7] Panaka was married to Mariek Panaka and had a niece named Versé and a nephew named Gregar Typho.[10]
            By 32 BBY,[11] he served under the fourteen year old Queen Padmé Amidala of the Naboo, whose safety he was personally entrusted. Because he knew his world was vulnerable to planetary assaults, Panaka advocated for stronger security measures, but the Queen's Advisory Council convinced her otherwise.[12] That year, however, the shipping and trade conglomerate known as the Trade Federation decided to blockade and invade Naboo[5] in retaliation to the taxation of the Free Trade Zone voted by the Republic's Galactic Senate.[13]
            When the battle droids of the Trade Federation raided the palace, both Panaka and his queen were taken into custody. However, unbeknownst to the enemy, the captain initiated a scheme in which one of the Amidala's handmaidens served as a decoy. Although the real queen was captured as well, the Neimoidian overlords of the Federation were fooled, and focused on the impersonator, a handmaiden named Sabé. Along with the queen, Governor Sio Bibble, and several security guards, Panaka was escorted out of the palace.[5]
            As the Naboo party were on their way to a detention camp, two Jedi and a Gungan jumped from a balcony to begin an attack and rescue the queen. Said Jedi, Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi were Republic ambassadors that had been sent to resolve the dispute behind the blockade, but to no avail. Panaka begrudgingly agreed with the Jedi's plan to take the queen with them to Coruscant, capital of the Republic, where she would plead her cause before the Senate. The party then retook the Theed Hangar from the battle droids stationed there, entered Amidala's Royal Starship, and blasted away from Naboo. However, in trying to slip through the blockade, the ship's hyperdrive engine took heavy damage. When Kenobi suggested that they land on the desert world of Tatooine for repairs, Panaka protested vigorously, arguing that the planet was ruled by Hutt gangsters. The queen, however, sided with the Jedi.[5]
            Once they arrived at Tatooine, Panaka remained on the ship while the Jedi, Jinn, their Gungan ally Jar Jar Binks, the astromech droid R2-D2, and Amidala—disguised as a mere handmaiden—went scouting for spare parts for the hyperdrive. At one point, the ship received a garbled transmission of a Sio Bibble hologram, pleading with the Queen to contact him rapidly. However, Kenobi suspected a trick, and he ordered Panaka and the others to send no reply nor transmission of any kind.[5]
            Eventually, Jinn and Amidala managed to obtain the missing hyperdrive parts thanks to the help of local slave boy named Anakin Skywalker, who earned his freedom in the process. The party then traveled to Coruscant, where they met Naboo's representative in the Senate, Sheev Palpatine. Anticipating an ambush by the Federation, Panaka accompanied Amidala to the Senate Chamber, where she and Palpatine pleaded their cause. The Senate, however, would not budge, so the Queen decided to return to Naboo and take the matter in her own hands. Panaka strongly objected, claiming that she would be captured and forced to sign a treaty that would legitimize the invasion.[5]
            While the Queen set off to make contact with Boss Rugor Nass, leader of the Gungan people,[5] Panaka organized the few Naboo security volunteers not captured by the Trade Federation into battle groups, who brought with them Flash speeders and Gian speeders.[14] Eventually, the leaders met to discuss strategy. It was decided that the militiagungs of the Gungan Grand Army would engage the droid army out of the city, while the Jedi and the Naboo would infiltrate the Royal Palace to try and capture Nute Gunray, Viceroy of the Trade Federation.[5]
            Using secret passages on the waterfall side of Theed, Panaka divided his forces in two. His group created a diversion, while the other, including the Jedi, liberated the N-1 starfighters from the Theed Hangar, allowing pilots to neutralize the Trade Federation droid control ship in orbit. On their way to reach the throne room, Panaka, the Queen, and the Jedi, encountered Darth Maul, a malevolent Sith Lord who had been following the Jedi since Tatooine. Panaka's group were forced to go the long way around while the Jedi stalled Maul.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Quarsh_Panaka</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascQuarshPanaka</string></dict>
        <key>Pyre</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.455.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Pyre was a human male who served in the First Order as a stormtrooper commander during the era of the New Republic.
            Pyre[3] was a human[1] male[2] who served as a commander in the forces of the First Order during the cold war. He and Major Elrik Vonreg proposed to Captain Phasma that the First Order should collaborate with pirates, which led to a partnership with Kragan Gorr and his pirate gang. The plan was for Kragan and his pirates to attack the Colossus enough so that Captain Imanuel Doza would cede control of the vital fueling station to the First Order. After a failed attack by the pirates, Kragan reported to Phasma and Major Vonreg, where Phasma stated her disappointment to Kragan and remarked that she was skeptical from the beginning of Pyre and Vonreg's idea.[3]
            Later, Pyre was sent to the Colossus along with several stormtroopers in search of two young fugitives, Kel and Eila, who had escaped the destruction of their village on the planet Tehar. He and his troops eventually cornered the two children in the engineering room, where Kel declared that he and his sister would rather die than be captured before apparently leaping to their deaths. Afterwards, Pyre reported to Phasma that his mission was complete, as the children were "no more". Unbeknownst to Pyre, Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono, his friend Neeku Vozo, and the Chelidae engineering staff had faked Kel and Eila's deaths.[2]
            Following another pirate attack on the station, Captain Doza messaged Pyre and asked to make arrangements. The First Order officer replied that he would arrive in person to discuss it.[5]
            Pyre returned to the Colossus, where he met with Doza to discuss sanctions that would allow the First Order to garrison an occupational force on the station to protect them from the pirates. When asked how many troopers would be stationed, Pyre assured Doza that there would be enough to stave off any further threats and that his men were more than capable of eliminating them. Doza then inquired to how long the occupation would last, to which Pyre replied that it was difficult to map out a timeline, citing that pirates can be unpredictable. The meeting concluded when Doza said he would need time to review the sanctions before coming to a decision. Pyre advised him not to too take long, for he was expecting an answer soon, then was escorted off the station.[6]
            As Pyre was about to board his shuttle, Jace Rucklin came running up, asking to speak with Doza. When asked if there was anything that should concern him, Doza assured Pyre that it was nothing he couldn't handle. Pyre soon departed the Colossus afterwards.[6]
            Pyre later sent First Order agent, Teroj Kee, with a pair of stormtroopers to the Colossus to acquire a phase connector from the Office of Acquisitions while its owners, Orka and Flix, were absent. Since the phase connector was already pre-ordered for a mining colony offworld, Kee resorted to stealing it. Kee later reported to Pyre that his transport carrying the device was sabotaged and destroyed. Pyre stated that this turn of events was unfortunate and that Phasma would not be pleased. He then ordered Kee to return at once.[7]
            Pyre and Phasma later converse with Kragan Gorr, having grown impatient that his raids had failed to drive Captain Doza into the First Order's arms. Gorr demanded triple payment to compensate for his losses, threatening to back out of their deal. With a nod from Phasma, Pyre instructed Gorr to kidnap Torra Doza to force her father to relinquish the station.[8]
            After Gorr's inside agent on the Colossus helped abduct young Torra, Pyre later sent Vonreg to meet with Gorr, under the guise of delivering payment when in truth it was to pull a doublecross and fake a rescue; Pyre also instructed Vonreg to give Gorr his regards. The ruse successfully convinced Doza to allow the First Order to garrison stormtroopers on the Colossus, as well earning goodwill among some of the platform residence.[8]
            Pyre later communicated with Captain Doza, who complained that his stormtroopers were actively undermining his authority. The ex-Imperial administrator reminded that the First Order was to remain only until after the pirate threat had been dealt with. Pyre argued that the First Order was doing what was necessary to protect the Colossus and its residents and insisted that Doza needed their protection.[9]
            Shortly afterwards, Pyre himself arrived to meet with Captain Doza. Doza informed him that the pirate spy he was looking for had recently escaped and thus he believed there was no need to maintain so many stormtroopers on the Colossus. Pyre argued that someone on the platform aided in her escape and stated he would find them. Doza then stressed that he was still in command, to which Pyre was forced to agree.[10]
            Pyre later inquired Doza as to why he left the Empire years ago. Doza insisted it was a personal choice and that Pyre wouldn't understand even if he explained why. Just then, Sergeant CS-812 and his squad entered Doza's office. Pyre requested Doza leave so he could speak with his troopers in private. As soon as Doza had left, Pyre informed that Phasma was sent a full garrison to the Colossus and instructed that sympathizers on the platform may remain while the dissidents shall be arrested or otherwise "dealt with".[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pyre</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPyre</string></dict>
        <key>Jax Pavan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.456.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jax Pavan was a Human male Jedi Knight who served the Jedi Order during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. His father, Lorn Pavan, was once employed at the Jedi Temple. He was trained by Even Piell, and during the Great Jedi Purge wielded a blue lightsaber. Following the Purge, he went underground, living in Coruscant's underworld. However, he was hunted by Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, forcing him to do whatever he could to survive.
            Jax's father worked at the Jedi Temple until the Jedi realized the Force potential in his two-year-old son. However, after agreeing to let the Jedi train Jax, Lorn was requested to leave the Temple, as Jedi trainees were seldom allowed contact with their parents. Lorn acquiesced, but missed his son terribly, and became extremely hostile towards the Jedi.
            Shortly before the Battle of Naboo, Lorn and his partner I-5YQ were chased by Darth Maul, who sought a holocube Lorn had obtained from Hath Monchar which detailed the planned blockade of Naboo. Lorn shut I-Five down for his own safety and entrusted him to an acquaintance with instruction to take the droid to the Jedi Temple. The acquaintance, however, saw the value in the modified droid and wiped his memory. Lorn was ultimately killed by Maul, who would in turn be defeated by then-Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, when he cut the Sith Lord in half during the Duel in Theed. It would be over a decade before Maul returned to the galaxy as a cyborg.
            As Kenobi's Padawan, Anakin Skywalker befriended Jax Pavan and confided in him. Anakin gave Jax a gift, a pyronium crystal. Jax was knighted three months before the Clone Wars ended.
            During the Clone Wars, I-Five found himself attached to a Republic Mobile Surgical Unit, with Sullustan Den Dhur and Padawan Barriss Offee. He worked at reconstructing his memories, and finally recalled Lorn's final request to him—to watch over his son. I-Five returned to Coruscant to find Jax and fulfill this request.
            Jax survived Order 66 living as a private investigator in the Blackpit Slums. During this time he discarded his Jedi robes for "a nondescript vest of black bantha leather, threadbare gray trousers, and black boots, with an ankle-length, gunmetal-colored greatcoat over it all," cut his dark brown hair and dyed it black, and permanently depilated his beard, in order to disguise himself, so he wouldn't be recognized as a Jedi. He worked with the underground organization Whiplash, who worked to create the "Underground Mag-Lev" to ferry politicians and others, including Jedi, who had incurred the Empire's wrath, off of Coruscant. Jax would eventually be reunited with his fellow freedom fighter Nick Rostu, who told him that Jax's Jedi Master, Even Piell, had before his death told Jax to find the protocol droid 10-4TO, nicknamed "Bug-Eyes", who held information crucial to the burgeoning rebellion. Jax would also ally with Laranth Tarak, I-5YQ and Den Dhur. During their search, Jax learned from Nick Rostu that Darth Vader was seeking him, for a reason unbeknownst to anyone.
            Jax and company tracked the droid, with the grudging help of Rokko, to Factory District on Coruscant, where he found Bug-Eyes in the possession of Prince Xizor. After a blistering battle with both the Falleen and the feral droids of the Factory District, Jax and company narrowly escaped the arrival of Darth Vader and returned to the sectors of Coruscant they called home. Although they could have left the planet, Jax was determined to stay and continue his work against the new order, and the others (the party now also included Kaird of the Nediji and Haninum Tyk Rhinann) agreed to stay with him.
            Jax and his group of friends became a part of the Whiplash movement on Coruscant, helping beings to escape offworld. One of their missions was to help the Zeltron Dejah Duare leave the planet. Her partner, however, the famous Caamasi artist Ves Volette, was murdered shortly after she came to them for help. They agreed to help her find Volette's killer. When Jax and his friends finally ended the investigation, they arranged for Dejah to leave, but were attacked at the spaceport by none other than the famed bounty hunter Aurra Sing, who Vader had hired to capture Jax. Sing engaged Jax in a duel, in which Jax survived by outsmarting Sing and dropping her into a reposicator, where he presumed she was killed. Afterwards, a gravely injured Laranth decided to leave Jax's group, while Dejah decided to stay on Coruscant and join it.
            Several months later, Jax and Laranth found and decided to train a young Force-adept named Kajin Savaros, who was being hunted by the Inquisitorius. Kajin's anger issues made it difficult for Jax to train him, and eventually Dejah, whose romantic overtures had been repeatedly spurned by Jax, betrayed the group by allying herself with Inquisitor Probus Tesla and Darth Vader, leading to Laranth and Kajin being kidnapped. Vader erased Kajin's memories and sought to train him as one of the Inquisitors, and had Laranth tortured in an attempt to acquire the bota plant extract Barriss Offee had given to I-5 and the Sith holocron that Rhinann had stolen.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jax_Pavan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJaxPavan</string></dict>

            At the time of the Second Imperial Civil War, Auchs was still in control of the Mandalorians. But unknown to him, Hondo Karr was still alive.

        <key>Otto</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.458.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Otto was a Human male from the planet of Coruscant who served in the Imperial Military, the armed forces of the Galactic Empire. As a general, he took part in the Galactic Civil War, a conflict between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Despite his status, Otto was regarded as largely incompetent. If it had not been the intervention of his friend, Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, Otto would have lost both his career and his life at the hands of Darth Vader, the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet. The general was relocated to the barren planet of Lok, where he was tasked with commanding an Imperial outpost. During his tenure on Lok, the general was forced to deal with an intruder who had been sent by the Rebel hero Han Solo to sow discord in the outpost. Dissatisfied with his situation, General Otto later deserted the Empire and entered Jabba the Hutt's demolition games with a stolen AT-ST. The general hoped he could garner enough money in the contest to fulfill his dream of buying a luxury apartment in Cloud City, a floating metropolis suspended high among the clouds of the planet Bespin.
            A male of the Human species, Otto hailed from the planet of Coruscant.[1] He was born in 63 BBY,[2] in the final decades of the Galactic Republic.[4] At some point in the period that followed the establishment of the Galactic Empire by the former Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in 19 BBY, Otto embraced a career in the Imperial Military. A bumbling, insignificant man, the Coruscanti climbed the promotion ladder only thanks to his connections with Admiral Conan Antonio Motti,[5] an Imperial Navy officer who had not hesitated to pad his own record himself.[6] Eventually, Otto attained the rank of Army general.[5]
            As an Imperial general, Otto got involved in the Galactic Civil War, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Empire and a resistance group called the Rebel Alliance. Though overzealous and loyal to Galactic Emperor Palpatine to the point of fanaticism, he lost many key battles to the Rebels during the early stages of the war.[3] He was also rumored to have been a drug addict.[7] Otto's career may have been damaged by his major blunders had it not been for another intervention of Admiral Motti, who saved him from the wrath of Darth Vader, the Emperor's second-in-command and Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet. Thanks to the machinations of Motti, Otto was quietly shipped to the planet of Lok, a desolate world in the Outer Rim Territories, where he was tasked with manning a massive Imperial outpost. On the disused wasteland of Lok, Motti hoped that his embarrassing friend would maintain a low profile.[1]
            Instead of fighting against organized crime on Lok, Otto chose to make an arrangement with its members. The general reached an understanding with Nym, the pirate leader of the Lok Revenants, promising that his activities would not be interfered with if he refrained from attacking the Imperial outpost.[8] Despite his arrangements, Otto once faced a brutal assault on his outpost led by a notorious local mercenary warlord, but his troops were able to thwart that attack. The general also experienced trouble with his fellow members of the Empire. According to the discharged Sergeant Moore, Otto was also at odds with other Imperials on Lok who sought to keep their activities secret from the general. Those activities included a mining facility where gasses and minerals were extracted, and the associated research facility, where a new type of grenade was being developed.[3]
            At some point following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, a defunct R4-series agromech droid that had once belonged to Otto fell into the clutches of the Sulfur Lake Pirates, who maintained a hideout on Lok. The droid's memory core, however, ended up in the hands of the mercenary Vana Sage, who wanted to blackmail Otto based on its contents. Around the same time, the Rebel hero Han Solo sent one of his agents to cause mayhem in the Imperial outpost and show General Otto that being assigned on a backwater planet was not going to be easy. Otto confronted the Rebel agent that had come to torment him,[3] but despite being a martial artist,[9] the Imperial was beaten during the showdown. However, the general successfully escaped his opponent before being killed. Ultimately, the Rebel intruder returned to Solo to claim their reward, leaving Otto with combat injuries and hurt feelings.[3]
            Such bad encounters and the sad spectacle of Lok's barren landscape made Otto dwell on his dream of retiring to a luxury apartment on Cloud City, a haven of airy platforms, spires, and towers floating in the atmosphere of the gas giant Bespin. Eventually, in pursuit of that dream, Otto stole a transport and abandoned the Empire, taking an AT-ST bipedal walker with him. Wanted by Imperial forces for desertion, Otto traveled to Tatooine,[1] a Hutt-controlled planet of the Outer Rim.[10] Around 4 ABY,[11] he had entered the demolition contests organized by the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, hoping to gather the riches he needed to achieve his dream. On the contest field of the Dune Sea, Otto confronted various worthy adversaries such as the bounty hunters Boba Fett and Aurra Sing, the Human smuggler named Wade Vox, the Dug Podracer Pugwis and the Wookiee engineer Quagga. The general also faced Malakili, the keeper of Jabba's rancor, as well as other accomplices of the Hutt, such as Wittin the Jawa. Unbeknownst to the general, three heroes of the Rebel Alliance had also entered the derby: the Princess of Alderaan and Rebel leader Leia Organa, disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh, the former Baron Administrator of Cloud City Lando Calrissian, posing as a guard named Tamtel Skreej, and the latter's cyborg assistant Lobot.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Otto</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascOtto</string></dict>
        <key>Reymet Autem</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.459.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Reymet Autem, a Human male, was the son of Sagoro Autem. Reckless by nature, he loved to participate in daredevil swoop-bike racing through Coruscant's garbage pits. Like his father, Reymet enrolled at the Guards' Academy due to his family's connection to the Senate Guard, but he did not like it.
            Reymet Autem attended the Leadership School on Andara, where he met Jedi undercover "transfer students" Anakin Skywalker and Ferus Olin in 25 BBY. A computer, tech, and security systems genius who loved to play practical jokes, Reymet assisted them with the investigation of the son of Senator Berm Tarturi, Gillam Tarturi, who was allegedly kidnapped, but who had set up his own father for his staged murder, to avenge himself of him.[2]
            In 26 BBY, Reymet was hired at the Staff College on the planet Andara, where he met Padawans Anakin Skywalker and Ferus Olin who were there to conduct research. Reymet became an expert when he manipulated the technical institutes' systems, which were being tested by Ferus.
            In the Guards' Academy, Reymet was a loner and had no friends, which he disclosed to Anakin Skywalker. After the disappearance of Ferus Olin, Reymet guided Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Siri Tachi to the Academy's ancient tunnels, from which they rescued Ferus.
            In 23 BBY, Reymet (having been suspended from the Academy) unknowingly helped his uncle Venco attempt to carry out his assassination attempt on Simon Greyshade. Already planning to go off-world with his girlfriend, Riao Siao, Reymet fled, helped by his father, who distracted the other Senate Guards long enough for Reymet to flee arrest.
            Reymet was soon followed by his mother Sula and sister Lissa, who had decided to leave Sagoro. In the years that followed, Reymet became a smuggler and information broker, one of his aliases being Evan Hessler.
            In 22 BBY, he was arrested for stealing a speeder belonging to Senator Simon Greyshade, after it was "borrowed" by Anakin Skywalker.
            However, after the war and the creation of the Galactic Empire, Reymet made an effort to find his father. Sagoro's name had appeared on a list of potential seditionists, and Darth Vader personally saw to capturing Autem. Under the guise of bounty hunter Evan Hessler, Reymet succeeded in "capturing" his father, having thwarted Tartuta and Severian. Upon revealing his true identity, Reymet and his father fled Coruscant to meet the rest of their awaiting family.

        <key>Bink Otauna</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.460.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bink Otauna was a legendary figure who along with his partner Tag Greenley constituted a mischievous duo. It is possible that the duo was based on actual persons, though historians continued to debate their existence.[1]
            Possibly born on Alderaan[2] he had many adventures with Tag. According to the legend, the two witnessed and also affected several important events of the Imperial Period chronicled in the Journal of the Whills, the exploits of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and the lives of the Skywalkers with outrageous and often hilarious results.
            Born to a Alderaanian family, Bink was a Force-sensitive, an unintended result of Darth Plagueis' manipulations of midi-chlorians. Barely Force sensitive, he was enough so to be accepted into the Jedi Order, where he met his friend-to-be Tag Greenley, another result of Plagueis' machinations. Both of the boys were weak in the Force, but they were able to scrape their way through their training. In order to stay afloat, Bink attempted to modify their grades by computer, but in the process accidentally deleted Kamino from the Jedi Archives. The two boys, afraid of being caught, fled, and ended up at Dex's Diner.
            There they tried to figure out what to do next, but were forced to run when Jango Fett, upon hearing a waitress' call of "Order 66!", tried to kill them. The two Padawans boarded a freighter bound for Naboo, where they accidentally ran into Anakin Skywalker, who was escorting Padmé Amidala back to her home. The two boys cut a deal with him; he would keep secret about their transgressions and help them get back home, and they would help him with his attempts to win Padmé. While this worked for a while, when Anakin sensed that his mother Shmi was worried about him and left Naboo, he left the two boys behind, and they were forced to find an alternate way home. However, this was just as the Clone Wars broke out, and as a result it took them three years to make their way back to Coruscant. They arrived at the Jedi Temple just in time to find a massacre taking place. Anakin, now Darth Vader, refrained from killing them, as they had helped him win Padmé over so many years ago. However, he gave them specific orders: to forget they were ever Jedi and leave forever. The two did so, deciding that Tatooine would be a perfect place to hide where nothing would happen.
            Nineteen years later, they had joined the Rebellion and were serving aboard the Tantive IV when it was captured by the Devastator over Tatooine. The two were taken prisoner by a pair of stormtroopers, but were able to overpower them and don their armor. Disguised, they were taken back onboard the Devastator and transferred to the first Death Star. When the Death Star arrived at Alderaan, they stole a pair of TIE fighters and headed for the planet. Unfortunately for them, this was just as Alderaan was destroyed, and the two found themselves in even more trouble when the Millennium Falcon arrived. Bink cautioned Tag not to return to the Death Star, but due to the Falcon's jamming, Tag misheard and did just that, thus luring the Falcon to be captured by the Empire. Still in disguise, the pair were put in charge of guarding the tractor beam power console that Obi-Wan Kenobi would later disable. They were almost called for duty as Darth Vader's wingmen, but managed to give him the slip and steal Grand Moff Tarkin's personal shuttle Tydirium. They were leaving the Death Star just as Luke Skywalker destroyed it, and their hyperdrive was knocked out, forcing them to make a landing on Yavin 4.
            This took them a few months, and by the time they arrived, the Rebels were long gone, the only things left being the leftover trash from the Rebel celebration and a medal reading "Chewie" that had been forgotten. Boba Fett arrived at this point, looking for Han Solo, but the pair got the drop on him. They tied him up and left for Cloud City to find old friend of Tag's, Lando Calrissian. Fett escaped soon after, and the two were shocked to see Slave I awaiting them. Lando wanted them gone, but when Tag reminded him that Lando had been taking credit for Tag's victory at the Battle of Taanab, Lando conceded and left to greet his other guest. The two hid in a room on Cloud City, but when they were surprised by C-3PO, Bink blasted him as payback for getting them caught on the Tantive IV. As a result, Lando made them escort Princess Leia Organa and Chewbacca to safety, but first they were taken to the carbon-freezing chamber, where Chewbacca knocked Tag unconscious. When he came to, the Empire was already taking control of the city, the Princess and Wookiee had already left, and a crowd of Cloud City's enraged inhabitants were pursuing them. Imperial reinforcements arrived in time, though, and the two were able to escape and get back to Mon Mothma and Gial Ackbar, with their captured Imperial shuttle in tow.
            Some time later, they were sent, again in the disguise of stormtroopers, to assist Lando in meeting a Rebel contact on Tatooine. When they interrupted his meeting with Kannen Doom, who was supposed to help him get Han Solo back from Boba Fett, he forced them to help instead. They distracted Fett as Lando searched the ship, pretending to be an Imperial customs team, but not only had Han already been taken, but Tag and Bink were caught by Boba, who recognized them. They subdued him, and Tag donned Fett's armor, while Bink disguised himself as a gangster, and together the two infiltrated Jabba Desilijic Tiure's palace. Their first plan was to help Leia get Han out, but when she was captured, they went to their next plan, helping Luke get both of them out. When he failed, they went to the plan after that, helping Luke overpower the guards at the Great Pit of Carkoon and escape. Tag, still disguised as Boba Fett, went to help Luke, but the Jedi, mistaking him for the bounty hunter, attacked him. When Han Solo hit his jetpack, Tag sailed into the mouth of the sarlacc. Bink fared little better. When they came to, they were in the custody of Kannen Doom, who had been looking for Boba Fett, mistaking him for his father, who had dumped her. Boba arrived soon after, gunning for the pair, and they escaped to meet their contact, Manuel Both-Hanz. He had information on a new Imperial space station, including that Emperor Palpatine would be aboard it. However, he was shot in their escape, and Manny Both-Hanz died bringing the Rebels the information. The two reported as such to Mon Mothma.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bink_Otauna/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBinkOtauna</string></dict>

        <key>Canderous Ordo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.464.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Canderous Ordo, later known as Mandalore the Preserver (Te Taylir Mand'alor in Mando'a), was a Mandalorian of Clan Ordo who fought in the Mandalorian Wars from 3976 BBY to 3960 BBY. While serving with the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, he participated in several battles, earning significant glory and prestige with his bold tactics and leadership. Despite their many successes, the Mandalorians were decisively defeated by Republic forces under the command of the Jedi Knight Revan, and Ordo was among the survivors who were forced to give up their weapons in unconditional surrender. The Mandalorians scattered across the galaxy and Ordo began working as a mercenary, eventually settling on the planet Taris. Under the employ of local crime lord Davik Kang, Ordo encountered his former enemy, Revan, although Ordo did not recognize him, as Revan was suffering from amnesia and now served as a Republic soldier.
            Having grown bored of his life as an enforcer and eager to seek new challenges, Ordo decided to join the Republic soldier and left Taris, traveling with Revan and his companions to Dantooine for a meeting with the local Jedi Council. Revan, who was retrained in the Jedi ways, was given the task of finding the location of the Star Forge, an ancient superweapon being used by Darth Malak's Sith Empire. Ordo accompanied Revan on his mission, confident that he would find new challenges along the way. Contributing his experience as a warrior and commander, Ordo helped Revan throughout his journey, content with having found a task worthy of his efforts. When Revan finally regained his memories and revealed his true identity, Ordo remained loyal and declared that he was proud to serve alongside such a formidable warrior. After Darth Malak was defeated and the Star Forge destroyed, Ordo, along with Revan and his companions, was honored by the Republic for his role in the conflict.
            After the conflict, Ordo reclaimed the mask of Mandalore with Revan's help and became the second leader of the Mandalorians since their defeat in the war. Revan soon regained memories of a threat in the Unknown Regions and left known space, instructing Ordo to restore the strength of the Mandalorians in preparation for his return. Ordo then began the arduous task of reuniting the scattered clans and rebuilding their military power. While reestablishing the Mandalorians, Ordo encountered another former opponent from the Mandalorian Wars, Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile. After learning that Surik was being hunted by the Sith Triumvirate, Ordo decided to aid her in gathering the Jedi Masters who had survived the Sith assassination campaign in order to prevent the Sith from regaining their power. While traveling with Surik, Ordo continued recruiting Mandalorian clans and was instrumental in helping Surik defeat the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus. After Surik eliminated the Sith Triumvirate, Ordo parted ways with her and awaited Revan's return from the Unknown Regions, keeping the Mandalorians ready for war.
            The Human male Canderous Ordo was born to the Clan Ordo on the Mandalorian planet Ordo, and grew up during an age of significant breakthroughs in Mandalorian technology, when the Basilisk war droids were being perfected.[6] In those days, young warriors would prove themselves in real combat with unknown opponents on a number of worlds. Ordo underwent[1] his verd'goten, the traditional Mandalorian rite of passage that marked the transition into adulthood at the age of thirteen,[7] and received the privilege of piloting his own Basilisk. Ordo remembered almost every battle he participated in, including his first, an eighty kilometer plunge through the atmosphere of an opposing planet on the back of a Basilisk war droid, dodging self-guided projectile and beam weapons, with barely any armor protecting him. During that battle, he gained considerable honor for his achievements, and became part of the most promising young warriors of his clan.[1]
            Following the defeat of the Mandalorian Crusaders and their Sith allies during the Great Sith War in 3996 BBY, he was recruited by Mandalore the Ultimate into the Neo-Crusaders to serve as a battle tactician rather than a foot soldier.[8] Sometime before 3963 BBY, Ordo and a party traversed the asteroid belts of the Crispin system in order to hunt the pirates and smugglers that used the frozen methane gas shells of the main belt for cover. Ordo targeted a small asteroid with a thermal detonator, causing the outer layer of frozen gas to explode and destroy the hidden ships. However, the asteroid then started rotating and firing thermal projectiles that easily melted through Mandalorian armor, mysteriously fleeing before the Mandalorians could counter-attack. They tracked the vessel towards the galactic rim only to abandon their search when the ship went beyond the borders of the galaxy.[1]
            By the time of the Mandalorian Wars, Ordo had attained the rank of commander and helped lead the Mandalorian's aggressive assault.[1] For thirteen years, before they would invade the Galactic Republic in 3963 BBY,[4] the Mandalorians stockpiled resources from the worlds they conquered just outside Republic jurisdiction. Ordo participated in countless battles of the wars, one of the most notable being the First Battle of Althir, in which he defeated an Althiri fleet ten times the size of his own and earned the command of an entire part of his clan. During the battle against the Althiri, Ordo's initial plan was to make a feint at flanks of the Althiri fleet in order to draw them out and weaken their formation. Ordo planned to have the bulk of his forces attack from the rear and defeat them. However, when the Althiri let their fleet split in two, leaving their center exposed, Ordo took advantage of the situation, breaking formation and eliminating the enemy commander, putting a quick end to the battle and avoiding further losses. However, in abandoning his position, Ordo left part of his own forces vulnerable and they suffered great losses. The sole survivor of that stand, another Mandalorian named Jagi, believed Ordo to be a glory hunter, and was determined to have his revenge.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Canderous_Ordo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCanderousOrdo</string></dict>
        <key>Oron Kira</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.465.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Oron Kira was a Beast Rider leader and King of Onderon who played a pivotal part in his homeworld's history, reigning as monarch during the onset of the Great Sith War. A Human male, Kira grew up during the turbulent period known as the Beast Wars, when the Beast Riders, prisoners cast out of the Onderonian capital of Iziz, went to war with the great walled city. The son of Beast-Lord Modon Kira, Oron Kira secretly traveled in and out of Iziz for years, trading with the political underground. On one trip, he met the love of his life, Princess Galia, heiress to the Onderonian throne. Galia reciprocated Kira's feelings, but the circumstances of the war would never allow a Beast Rider and the Princess of Onderon to marry. Kira and Galia formulated a plan to circumvent their dilemma in 4000 BBY; Kira and a fellow Beast Rider, Gobee, would break into the Iziz Royal Palace and "kidnap" Galia, bringing her back to Kira's fortress beyond Iziz's borders so they could be wed. The plan went off without hitch, and their marriage soon began. However, the ceremony was interrupted by three Jedi Knights—Human brothers Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, and Twi'lek Tott Doneeta—sent by Queen Amanoa to retrieve Galia. The Jedi nearly made off with the Princess, but, after she protested and professed her love for Kira, she was returned to her betrothed. Kira and his family then revealed the dark side corruption of the Onderonian monarchy to the Jedi and enlisted them in the campaign to end the Beast Wars once and for all.
            After peace negotiations with Amanoa failed, Kira fought with a massive Beast Rider army in a final assault on Iziz. Although Amanoa's dark magic took a heavy toll on the Beast Riders, Kira's forces finally took Iziz, thanks to the battle meditation of newly-arrived Jedi Master Arca Jeth. Amanoa died at the end of the battle, and Kira became the new King of Onderon. As monarch, Kira soon faced another crisis, the Freedon Nadd Uprising, during which Sith cultists, led by former King Ommin, rose up and waged war on the new Onderonian regime. Although the Iziz Royal Palace was destroyed and Kira and Galia were briefly forced out of Iziz, they retook the city with help from the Jedi and put an end to the rebellion. Kira also fought in several more battles in the next few years; he lent his Beast Riders to Jedi forces in an engagement on Empress Teta in 3997 BBY, an attempt to retrieve Ulic Qel-Droma, who had begun to fall to the dark side, from the Krath cult on the planet. The next year, Kira and his fellow Beast Riders successfully defended Onderon from an army of Mandalorian invaders during the Great Sith War. His descendants went on to hold the Onderonian throne for more than four thousand years.
            Oron Kira was a Human male from the wilds of Onderon, born sometime before the onset of the Great Sith War. Kira was reared amongst the Beast Riders, a society of dissidents who thrived on their banishment from the great walled city of Iziz by taming and riding the dangerous beasts of the Onderonian wilderness. Kira was the son of Beast-Lord Modon Kira, the leader of the Beast Riders, and the grandson of Drokko Kira, a man who was cast out of Iziz for challenging the dark side-worshiping monarchy of the planet. Kira grew up in the time of unending war between the Beast Riders and Iziz, when Kira's people struck back against those who had cast them out. Although banned from Iziz, Oron and his father secretly went in and out of the city for years, trading with the political underground there. While on one of his secret journeys into Onderon, Kira ventured into the garden of the Iziz Royal Palace; there, he caught a glimpse of Princess Galia, heiress to the Onderonian throne. It was love at first sight for the two, and in 4000 BBY, they arranged to run away together. As it was unthinkable that the Princess of Onderon would marry a Beast-Lord, their plan was for a contingent of Beast Riders to kidnap Galia from the palace and bring her back to Kira's fortress, where their wedding would take place.[1]
            The plan went off without hitch, as Kira and his right-hand man, Gobee,[2] successfully retrieved Galia and brought her to the fortress, where the wedding promptly began. However, the ceremony was interrupted by a group of three Jedi Knights—brothers Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, and the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta—who rode in on tamed boma beasts. The Jedi had been hired by Galia's mother, Queen Amanoa, to bring her back to Iziz. The Knights' bold charge proved initially successful, as Ulic Qel-Droma was able to grab hold of Galia in an attempted rescue. However, Galia expressed her willingness to marry the Beast-Lord, and, at the behest of Modon Kira, the Jedi laid down their arms as Oron and Galia embraced. With hostilities between the Beast Riders and the Jedi put to an end, the intruders were invited to join the Kiras at the wedding banquet. There, Oron told the Jedi Knights about how he and Galia fell in love and revealed that the Onderonian monarchs were in fact dark side servants. Hoping to put an end to the conflict between Iziz and the Beast Riders, Ulic Qel-Droma proposed that he go to Iziz with Oron and Galia to ask Amanoa for peace. Although Oron thought this plan unwise, Drokko Kira, speaking for the first time in decades, agreed with Qel-Droma's idea and asked for the Jedi to go to war with the dark side if the peace talks failed. The plan of action was then set: Oron, Galia, and the Jedi visitors would travel to the Iziz Royal Palace in Qel-Droma's starship, the Nebulon Ranger, and begin peace talks with Amanoa; if they failed, Modon Kira would lead the Beast Rider army against Iziz in one final battle.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Oron_Kira</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascOronKira</string></dict>
        <key>Bail Prestor Organa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.466.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bail Prestor Organa (formally styled as His Serene Highness, Prince Bail Organa, First Chairman and Viceroy of Alderaan) was a Human male who served as the First Chairman and Viceroy of Alderaan, and served in the Galactic Senate as the Senator of the Alderaan sector from 32 BBY to 19 BBY. Subsequently, he was Senator of the Alderaan sector of the Imperial Senate from 19 BBY to 1 BBY. He was Princess Leia Organa's adoptive father and a friend of Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Rahm Kota, and Jedi Knight Ylenic It'kla. He was also a friend and colleague of Leia's biological mother, Senator Padmé Amidala, and was present when Leia and Luke were born. He was married to Queen Breha Organa. One of the main founders of the Rebel Alliance, he was killed when the Death Star obliterated Alderaan. In the Alliance and its successor states, the New Republic and Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, he was respected as a martyr who died for his cause.
            Bail Prestor Organa, a male Human, was a native of Alderaan,[1] a planet of pristine beauty the inhabitants of which were among the Core Founders of the Galactic Republic.[11] Born in 67 BBY,[2] his parents were two of the most important people on his homeworld. His mother Mazicia was the reigning queen of Alderaan,[12] and his father belonged to the prestigious House of Organa,[13] one of the princely dynasties among which the crown of Alderaan traditionally befell.[14] He also had three sisters: Rouge, Celly, and Tia.[15] Additionally, his maternal uncle Tayvor Mandirly was a notorious agricultural expert.[6] Like all the scions of his noble bloodline, the young Organa enjoyed a golden childhood. While he always had all the material things he needed, Organa's parents were careful never to spoil him.[6] As a youth, Bail Organa was trained to eventually take up Alderaan's seat in the Galactic Senate. Despite the rampant corruption that had spread its tentacles to most of the political class, the actions of civic-minded statesmen such as Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum finally convinced Organa that he could do well in the Senate.
            Despite his pampered upbringing, Organa maintained many personal acquaintances across Alderaan which crossed class boundaries. Taking an interest in the son of two archivists at the Royal Library of Alderaan, Organa championed the young Halagad Ventor's education and assisted him in his rise through the academy system. The two swiftly became friends and it wasn't long before Ventor was a welcomed presence around House Organa. Inspired by Ventor's desires to become a Jedi, Organa assisted the youth in pursuing his dreams by granting him access to both mental and physical training across Alderaan.[16] In 32 BBY,[17] Bail Organa's future ascent to the position of viceroy was put into question. That year, Alderaan was wracked by the Alderaan Ascendancy Contention, a bitter feud between House Organa and the rival House Antilles over which family had the proper claim to the title of viceroy.[18] After three deadlocked votes, the High Council of Alderaan[19] appealed to the Galactic Senate for mediation, and a special dispatch led by the Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth was sent to oversee the dispute. During this time, Organa became acquainted with the Jedi Knight Everen Ettene who championed his cause and the two maintained a positive relationship.[16] In less than one month, C'baoth guided the tribunal to a decision that favored the Organas. Subsequently, Organa's father was made viceroy[13] and the rivaling families were joined together in marriage at the Jedi's behest.[18]
            In the wake of the standoff, the victorious Organa family decided to celebrate by sending young Organa, his sister Tia and the Ventor family as their representatives to the Okonomo Retreat on the beautiful island resort. Eager to spend the holiday hunting manka cats that roamed wild on the island, Organa did not reprimand his sister or his friend as they made passes at each other. Despite Tia's proposed marriage to a nobleman of House Vandron, she pursued her brother's friend during the trip all while Organa turned a blind eye. The three were out hunting when Organa received word that a terrible tragedy had befallen the retreat. A madman had infiltrated the dinner and had infected the gathered nobility with a hive virus which provoked anthropophagitism in its victims. Among the victims were both of Ventor's parents', Ean and Zollet, who in their madness ate each other before being consumed by the madman.[16]
            At some point when it seemed that the old Republic was already crumbling, a group of Alderaanian scouts under the responsibility of First Chairman Organa discovered the remote and mineral-rich planet of Isis. Bail Organa, who foresaw a time of turmoil in the not-too-distant future, chose to to keep information about this world secret, only revealing its existence to his close political allies.[20]
            In 32 BBY, the peaceful planet Naboo was invaded by the droid army of the Trade Federation, a labyrinthine organization of trade officials, which provoked a crisis in the Galactic Senate. Padmé Amidala, queen of the Naboo, came to plead her case before the Senate and, seeing that Valorum would not react, she called for a Vote of No Confidence in the Chancellor.[21] Despite not being a senator, Bail Organa was present in the plenary chamber, and he stepped out to second the motion,[22] as did the Roonan delegate Edcel Bar Gane.[23] Before the chair could find a motive to postpone the vote, Organa argued that the motion could suffer no delay, since it was on the floor and had to be voted during the ongoing session.[22]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bail_Prestor_Organa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBailPrestorOrgana</string></dict>

Orvek worked with Barr on Mon Cala until Darth Vader discovered them. Orvek sacrificed himself to slow the Sith Lord down.
            Shortly after the founding of the Galactic Empire, Orvek's home was bulldozed for an Imperial relay facility. One of the citizens protested to the clone troopers but they pointed their guns at them and Orvek was forced to leave. Sometime later Orvek met Ferren Barr, an Iktotchi Jedi Padawan who claimed to be a Jedi Master. Barr convinced Orvek into joining him using a Jedi mind trick and Orvek subsequently became one of Barr's six acolytes.[1]
            Barr took Orvek and the other acolytes to Mon Cala, where Barr came to influence the King in his negotiations with the Empire. The king's way of negotiating caught the attention of the Emperor who sent Darth Vader, three Inquisitors and a squad of elite Purge Troopers. When Barr assassinated Ambassador Telvar, the man's superior, Moff Wilhuff Tarkin,[3] sent forces down to invade Mon Cala.[2]
            Many battles broke out and Vader obtained the location of Barr and his acolytes. The king told Barr that Vader was coming[4] and Barr ordered the evacuation of his refuge. However, when leaving the refuge, the acolytes ran into Vader on his Imperial submarine. One of the other acolytes, Nipaltoo shot at Vader's submarine and Vader crushed his helmet. The others fled for Bel City and Orvek realized Vader was catching up. Orvek turned around and attacked Vader's submarine head on. Orvek was killed but he slowed Vader down enough for the others to make it to Bel City.[1]
            Orvek had blond hair, brown eyes, and pale skin. He cared for the Mon Calamari's plight, as he was reluctant to abandon them.[1]
            Orvek first appeared in Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 14: Burning Seas, Part II, a 2017 canon comic written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Giuseppe Camuncoli.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Orvek</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascOrvek</string></dict>

A famous war hero to the Republic, Din spent more time serving alongside the soldiers of the Republic Military than any other Jedi as he fought against the Sith offensive in the Minos Cluster during much of the twenty-eight–year war. Din and his good friend Lieutenant Harron Tavus of the Republic Special Forces Division became known as the "Heroes of Karideph" after turning back the Imperial invaders on the planet of Karideph, and the Jedi Master trained several Padawans to Knighthood throughout the conflict.
            Returning to the capital of Coruscant in 3653 BBY, Din and Tavus fought in the Sacking of Coruscant when the Empire attacked the planet, and the Jedi became the personal enemy of the Sith Lord Darth Angral during the battle. However, Din's apprentice Bengel Morr was lost in the fall of the Jedi Temple, and after the Treaty of Coruscant officially ended the war Din joined the rest of the Order in migrating to their recently rediscovered homeworld of Tython. Appointed to the High Council, Din helped guide the Order through the next decade as they rebuilt their ranks, and took on his first Padawan since Morr when he witnessed a young student defeat a Dark Jedi who had been leading the native Flesh Raiders in an attack against the Order.
            A Force-sensitive Human male who was born on the planet Rishi,[1] Orgus Din was trained as a Jedi by the Jedi Order, and he had achieved the rank of Jedi Master by the later years of the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire.[4] By the year 3653 BBY, Din had trained many Padawans to the rank of Jedi Knight, including a Human named Fortris Gall,[7] and he had taken on another apprentice in the Nautolan Bengel Morr.[8] During the last months of the war, Din was stationed in the Minos Cluster of the Outer Rim, where he fought alongside the Republic Military and the Republic Special Forces Division against the Sith offensive in the star cluster. During the fighting, he became good friends with Sergeant Harron Tavus from the Special Forces unit Havoc Squad.[4]
            In 3653 BBY, the Sith Empire approached the Republic with a surprising peace offer, and delegations from both sides held a peace conference on the Core World of Alderaan. As a gesture of goodwill, the Empire halted its offensive in the Minos Cluster, and Din and Tavus were recalled to the Republic capital of Coruscant to give a report before the Galactic Senate. Speaking with Supreme Chancellor Berooken, the two confirmed the news from the Minos Cluster, and they were departing the Senate Building when Tavus heard explosions. Outside, they discovered that a Sith armada under the command of Darth Angral was attacking the capital, and the pair immediately rushed to Coruscant's defense as a Sith battlecruiser landed in the Senate Plaza.[4]
            Angral himself emerged from the cruiser to lead the assault on the Senate Building, and Din engaged the Sith Lord in a duel after stopping him from killing a Republic soldier. As Tavus rallied the military nearby to drive back Angral's soldiers, the Jedi Master began to fight the Sith, but Angral quickly disarmed him with by slamming into the Jedi with his shoulder. Before Angral could kill his downed opponent, however, a damaged Sith cruiser crashed into a nearby building and blew the Sith Lord off of his feet. Tavus, who had just noticed that the Jedi Temple was under attack, called out for the Jedi Master, and Din escaped from Angral by leaping across a collapsing bridge.[4] Angral and Din's duel would spark a rivalry between the two that would span a decade and involve both men's apprentices.[3]
            Din and Tavus were too late, however, when they reached the Temple—explosives planted deep within the structure were detonating and causing the grand edifice to collapse in on itself. Din's apprentice Morr[8] had been present in the Temple during the attack, and a despondent Din believed his student to be among the dead.[7]
            Din was later sent by Grand Master Zym to deal with the trouble his former Padawan, Fortris Gall, had caused on Balmorra. En-route, he encountered and rescued Satele Shan from Mandalorian mercenaries. After being briefed on the situation by her, he decided to inform Zym. He finally met his Padawan, Fortris, and decided to take over the evacuation of the planet. Soon later, after hearing the death of Grand Master Zym, Din tracked Braden, the bounty hunter responsible on Nar Shaddaa. After a brief but intense duel, Din was holding his lightsaber at Braden's neck demanding info. Braden promised to hand over the info, as soon as they reached Dantooine.[7]
            Braden later escaped from Master Din's custody. After failing to recapture Braden, Din returned to the Republic base, where the Major in charge had finally agreed to pull out. He then met with Satele, Tavus and Gall. The three of them had recently put an end to the real culprit behind the treaty's disruption, but didn't give Din a full report on the matter.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Orgus_Din</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascOrgusDin</string></dict>

His family had great influence over Coruscant and the Academy, resulting in him getting away with whatever he wanted. He, like the majority of his classmates and the faculty of the Academy, was surprised and displeased by the arrival of Thrawn, an alien from the Unknown Regions who defied the xenophobia running rampant throughout the Galactic Empire, and so he conspired with Rosita Turuy and several other classmates to get rid of him. First, he and Turuy invited Thrawn to the metallurgy lab to gamble, an activity strictly forbidden by the Academy, in an effort to get him caught doing so. This attempt failed when Thrawn brandished a lieutenant's plaque Commandant Deenlark, the president of the Academy, had given him in order to hasten his graduation. When an instructor Orbar had discreetly called for burst in, he saw the plaque and had no choice but to leave them to their activities, as lieutenants were allowed in the metallurgy lab. Orbar, Turuy, and their fellow conspirators resorted to physically attacking Thrawn, but thanks to intervention from Eli Vanto, Thrawn's aide, this attempt also failed. Thrawn and Vanto later reported the attack to Commandant Deenlark, who was surprised when Thrawn, instead of demanding that his assailants be punished, recommended that they be transferred to Skystrike Academy, as he had noted while under attack from them that they had displayed tremendous aptitude as fighter pilots. Deenlark granted Thrawn's request, and in a stroke of genius on Thrawn's part, Orbar and Turuy's co-conspirators disappeared without a trace, leaving them paranoid and unsure of their fate.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Spenc_Orbar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSpencOrbar</string></dict>

        <key>Dustil Onasi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.474.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dustil Onasi was the Force-sensitive son of Morgana Onasi and war veteran Carth Onasi. He was taken by the Sith during the bombing of Telos IV, and later trained at the Sith Academy on Korriban before turning away from the Sith and returning home.
            Dustil was born on Telos IV and raised mostly by his mother due to his father's constant absence as a soldier in the Republic Navy. During the bombardment and destruction of Telos IV's surface during the Jedi Civil War, Dustil's mother was killed and he was assumed dead. In reality he had survived (and according to him, was captured), but developed a strong dislike for both the Galactic Republic and his father for their inability to save Telos IV.[1]
            Some time later, a friend of Dustil's named Selene convinced him to join the Sith Academy on Korriban. There he embraced his hate for the Republic and his father and quickly became one of the more promising students there. He was strong with the Force and proficient in combat, and soon attracted the watchful eye of the academy's headmaster, Uthar Wynn.[1]
            While training, Dustil developed a relationship with Selene, who was also a student at the academy. However, Selene was not as promising as Dustil. This distressed Master Uthar, who felt that such an emotional entanglement would hinder his best student's progress. The conniving Sith Master secretly had the young woman murdered and then lied to Dustil about the occurrence, saying she had died on a mission in the valley. All of these experiences just pushed him more towards the Sith, as he felt the Sith cared for him and that they were his family. This also made him think that his father never cared for him, and that his father was the sole reason his mother was dead. As a result he had severed his family ties to his father. At some point he met Jordo, an old friend of Carth, who was making a stop on Korriban while working for Czerka Corporation. Dustil didn't recognize Jordo, but Jordo did recognize Dustil.[1]
            During the Jedi Civil War, Carth learned from Jordo that Dustil was still alive on Korriban. He and Revan, a former Sith Lord, infiltrated the Sith Academy to try to find the Star Map on Korriban, while Carth also accompanied to find Dustil. Carth soon found Dustil but was hurt by the choices Dustil had made. He tried to talk with him and convince him to turn away from the Sith by telling them that they were evil. Dustil refused, still wanting to blame his father for his mother's death, and believed the Sith to now be his true, caring family.[1]
            However, Dustil chose to allow Carth a chance to prove that the Sith were evil while giving his word that he would not inform anyone that he knew Revan and Carth were at the Academy under false pretense, provided they did nothing to endanger his standing with the Sith. When Revan and Carth found a journal of Master Uthar's in his private chambers detailing the events of Selene's death, they decided to show it to the young man as proof that the Sith were truly evil. With this newfound knowledge, an emotionally distraught Dustil was convinced to forsake the Sith and their teachings.[1]
            Dustil promised to eventually meet his father on Telos IV, where they could begin to repair their relationship. Instead of leaving the Academy immediately, he decided to remain on Korriban to try and help as many of his friends as possible and to find some information inside the Academy that could help the Republic. Carth wished him luck, though had doubts as to whether his son would ever be the same.[1]
            Dustil was strong in the Force and showed remarkable progress in being able to use it and was skilled in the use of his lightsaber. This had impressed Uthar Wynn. It was known that he was able to use Force drain and Force Horror and basic Telekinesis as some of his abilities in combat.[1]
            According to his father, Dustil always hated being deceived. Carth also recognized that Dustil is stubborn and never did anything by half measures, something father and son had in common.
            His father and the Republic's inability to save Telos and his mother were the core sources of his anger and hatred. When Carth, traveling with Revan, found Dustil at the academy, he nearly attacked his father for not being present when Telos IV was bombed by the Sith.[1]
            Although he was following the ways of the Sith, he was not yet ready to completely sever his connections to his past though he was relatively close. He still kept his surname, though preferred to use only his first name; use of his last name angered him. When he met Jordo, he didn't recognize him. When Carth found Dustil, Dustil immediately expressed his disdain for Carth. On the other hand, Dustil still remembered his mother and thought well enough of her to claim her as family.[1]
            Dustil was still able to make some friends in the Academy and even developed a romantic relationship with Selene. After realizing that the Sith killed Selene, he was shocked that the Sith had been lying to him all the time, for he had been a loyal student. Because of this, it was likely that he would not allow the Sith to deceive him again.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dustil_Onasi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDustilOnasi</string></dict>
        <key>Granta Omega</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.475.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Granta Omega was the son of the Dark Jedi Xanatos and the grandson of Telosian Governor Crion. Omega vowed revenge on the Jedi Order for his father's death, not wanting to accept the fact that Xanatos killed himself.
            Granta Omega was born on Telos IV 18 years before the Invasion of Naboo to Tura Omega and the Dark Jedi Xanatos, who became the First Citizen of Telos IV. At age 3, he was sent with his mother to hide on the moon of Nierport VII, where Tura worked at a refueling station. Xanatos told his son everything about the Jedi Order, his former Master Qui-Gon Jinn, and how much they "misunderstood" the Force. While he hoped that Omega would be Force-sensitive, he soon realized this was not the case. Nevertheless, upon his death, he left his fortune from the Offworld Mining Corporation to Omega.
            As a young man, Omega left his home to attend the All Sciences Research Academy on Yerphonia sponsored by Senator Sano Sauro. His mother died two years later; he never came back to Nierport VII for the funeral.
            A few years following the Invasion of Naboo, Omega hired a number of bounty hunters to capture the Jedi training on Ragoon VI. The Jedi that were there, Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (accompanied by their Jedi pilot Wren Honoran), managed to evade the numerous traps set out by the bounty hunters, including a trap that Omega himself set.
            Omega reappeared in 26 BBY under the alias of "Dr. Tic Verdun" to attack Kenobi and Skywalker while on a mission to rescue five war-besieged scientists on Haariden. There, Obi-Wan discovered that Omega planned to dominate the galactic bacta market through the mining of titanite on Haariden.
            Returning to Galactic City, Kenobi delved into research on Omega and discovered, with the help of Jedi Temple archivist Jocasta Nu, that Granta was a native of Nierport Seven—a small moon less than a day's journey from Coruscant. With a penchant for collecting Sith artifacts, but possessing no Force sensitivity at all, Omega was extremely wealthy, though Kenobi could not determine the vast sources of his wealth.
            After Omega later captured Anakin in an attempt to impress the galaxy's hidden Sith Lord, the boy managed to escape and, along with his Master, stopped Omega from pursuing his titanite venture by literally chasing him off planet when Haariden's great volcano erupted. While the Jedi were caught in the disaster, they managed to blast themselves free and catch up with Omega in a final confrontation, pinning him between themselves and a great tidal wave. Even so, the ever-elusive Omega again escaped Kenobi and Skywalker's grasp, eluding capture to slip offworld.
            In 25 BBY, Omega appeared on the world of Mawan disguised as a crime-lord named Striker (so named because of the projectile pistols his gang used for their first raid on its populace). Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Yaddle were assigned to the planet to negotiate peace between the warring factions there (not knowing that it was Omega who was the orchestrator of everything going on there; indeed, he was reputed to have the most extensive weapons cache of all the crimelords). Omega once again captured Skywalker, and this time was not averse to killing him, his Jedi Masters (Kenobi, Yaddle, Yoda), and all of Mawan with a bioweapon, to further impress the Sith Lord. Though Skywalker escaped and Mawan was protected, Omega succeeded in killing Master Yaddle, who had been protecting Anakin at the time. Omega prepared to escape Mawan from the heart of its capital city Naatan, and Obi-Wan Kenobi tried to stop him. It was during his escape that Omega revealed to Kenobi that he was the son of Xanatos and grandson of Crion. Kenobi was utterly astonished by this news, but realized that it all made sense. Omega obviously inherited his father's fortune from Offworld Mining Corporation, and his father's hatred of the Jedi.
            Over the next few months, Omega worked with the scientist Jenna Zan Arbor. Together they planned to use the nuero-drug known as the Zone of Self-Containment to control thousands of innocent people. In these months, Kenobi and Skywalker encountered Zan Arbor, and were led through a string of puzzles on worlds such as Romin and Falleen that led them to finding Omega on Coruscant. Here they discovered that Omega planned to assassinate Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Though the assassination was foiled, and Palpatine was protected by the Jedi Padawan Ferus Olin, a number of innocent lives were taken (including Senatorial aide Tyro Caladian, who had learned of Palpatine's true identity, but was unable to inform anyone before he was killed).[1] After a battle with Obi-Wan on his speeder bike, Omega managed to escape the Jedi yet again.
            Omega was finally granted an audience with the Sith on Korriban and took Zan Arbor with him. He met with the Sith Lord in a tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords, and moments later, encountered the Jedi. He shot and killed Darra Thel-Tanis with his KYD-21 blaster pistol when she tried to protect fellow Padawans Ferus Olin and Tru Veld. After that, he fled and was followed by Obi-Wan. Omega manned an E-web against Kenobi. His weapon overheated and exploded. Omega was thrown against a wall. He made another attempt to attack Kenobi, but was too weak, and Obi-Wan was forced to kill Omega with his lightsaber. Omega's last words were "I know who he is. You will wish you did," referring to Darth Sidious.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Granta_Omega</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGrantaOmega</string></dict>
        <key>Cal Omas</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.476.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cal Omas was a male Alderaanian who served as the last Chief of State of the New Republic, and the first of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, of which he was a founder. He began his service in galactic affairs when he joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic following the destruction of his home planet. He succeeded Leia Organa as Senator of the People of Alderaan in the New Republic, and served in that position for several years, until Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya's suicide on Coruscant during the Yuuzhan Vong attack on the capital.
            Omas's peers in the Republic elected him as Fey'lya's successor, and although the New Republic would soon become the Galactic Alliance, the Alderaanian's leadership would see the end of the destructive Yuuzhan Vong War. However, peace was a rarity in the galaxy, and not more than five years later, trouble brewed in the Unknown Regions. The Dark Nest Crisis would not only pose problems to the Alliance externally, but would also create a rift between the government and the Jedi. Omas himself clashed, on several occasions, with Jedi such as Kyp Durron, Kenth Hamner, Jacen Solo, and even Luke Skywalker himself. Though the rift was eventually healed, the wound would be opened up again in due course.
            When the Alliance was faced with the threat of secession by the Corellians, Omas found himself accosted from all sides. Jacen Solo teamed up with Supreme Commander Cha Niathal, and began chipping away at Omas's government. The Chief of State could do little to retaliate, but when his opposite number in the Corellian government, Dur Gejjen, contacted him for peace talks, Omas saw an opportunity. However, his efforts to work with the Corellians to remove Niathal and Solo were disrupted by soldiers acting on Solo's orders. The upstart Solo then had Omas arrested, and he and Niathal replaced the Alderaaniaan as Joint Chiefs of State. To add insult to injury, Solo told young Ben Skywalker that Omas was responsible for the death of Mara Jade Skywalker (whom Solo himself had killed). Ben did not believe Solo, but he considered killing Omas to get near to Jacen, breaking into his prison cell. Before he could, however, Omas told Skywalker of Solo's duplicity, and then deliberately fell on Skywalker's saber, bringing the young man to the resolution he sought, and allowing him to regain the trust of Jacen Solo. He was survived by his daughter, Elya Omas.
            A native of the planet Alderaan, Cal Omas was outside his homeworld during its destruction by the Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon. Like many idealistic survivors of that world, he devoted himself fully to the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. He served with distinction in the Rebel military for several years under the Mon Calamari Admiral Ackbar,[3] and after the major Rebel victory at the Battle of Endor, he went on to become a politician in the New Republic. He was elected to the Senate by the survivors of Alderaan in 11 ABY, following the selection of Leia Organa Solo as the new Chief of State. After the ascension of Borsk Fey'lya as Chief of State in 23 ABY, Omas was selected to serve on the Advisory Council, becoming one of the more moderate and few pro-Jedi members in the body, a stance that made him a rarity.[1] At some stage, he fathered a daughter, Elya.[2]
            Around the time that the Yuuzhan Vong invaded in 25 ABY, Omas, along with Senator Triebakk of Kashyyyk, supported Luke Skywalker's proposal of a new Jedi Council.[1] Soon enough, however, Coruscant grew more and more aware of the scope and destructive potential of the Vong, and following the Battle of Ithor, where the Jedi Knight Corran Horn was blamed for the ensuing devastation, the New Jedi Order found themselves under the scrutiny of the government. In spite of this, Omas continued his support of Skywalker's Jedi.[4]
            His stance constantly put him at odds with Chief of State Fey'lya, who was convinced that the Jedi had a vendetta against the Bothans. In the first year of the war, based upon intelligence from Talon Karrde, Omas recommended that a defense force be assigned to Corellia, but was outvoted.[5] The war, however, went poorly for the Republic. The Vong cut a swath towards the core, and eventually, Coruscant itself fell. Omas went missing during the evacuation, and the wavering Republic feared for the worst, especially the Jedi he had vehemently supported.[6]
            Fey'lya had sacrificed himself, and the Republic was in disarray, on the run as it had been in the heyday of the Galactic Empire. However, Omas had escaped the chaos on Coruscant, and had managed to flee with a minimum of fuss. He made his way to Mon Calamari, where he was reunited with the remainder of the Advisory Council.[3]
            Omas was one of the candidates to replace Fey'lya as the new Chief of State for the New Republic. Unlike the previous elections for the position, where the candidate selected won by large margins, the election promised to be a closely fought match. His primary opponent, Fyor Rodan of Commenor, immediately placed himself as the candidate who wanted to end the war—without any help or advice from the Jedi. Omas made his view clear—he fully intended to work with the Jedi to win the war. Two other candidates emerged as well: Cola Quis of Ryloth, who planned to get an early lead in the polls, and Ta'laam Ranth of Antar 4, who clamored for a large block of voting support not to win, but to decide the outcome of the election.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cal_Omas</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCalOmas</string></dict>
        <key>Alrich Wren</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.477.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alrich Wren was a human male Mandalorian, and the husband of Ursa Wren, leader of Clan Wren. Upon his marriage to Ursa, Alrich elected to adopt his wife's surname, because of the power and respect it held in Mandalorian society. The couple had two children together, a son named Tristan, and a daughter they named Sabine. Alrich, unlike his wife and children, was not a warrior, being an artist instead. Sabine inherited his artistic talents. After his daughter fled the Imperial Academy of Mandalore, he eventually found himself a political prisoner in all but name, held on Mandalore to ensure his wife and clan's compliance with the Imperial occupation
            At some point in time following the Battle of Atollon, Alrich's daughter Sabine led a mission to rescue her father from Imperial custody. Amid a heated ambush of an Imperial convoy transporting Wren to the Mandalorian capital of Sundari for execution, Wren was successfully rescued by the rebel agent Ezra Bridger, and reunited with his daughter.
            Alrich Wren was the husband[1] of Countess Ursa Wren, the leader of Clan Wren.[2] After marrying Ursa, Alrich adopted his wife's surname, because of the power and respect it held in Mandalorian society.[3] The couple produced two children together, a daughter named Sabine and a son named Tristan. Alrich and his family supported the Galactic Empire and its New Order, which emerged following the Clone Wars.[4]
            When Tristan was still an infant, Alrich often travelled to Tarre Vizsla's statue on Mandalore with Sabine, to appreciate its art and history.[5]
            While Sabine was studying at the Imperial Academy of Mandalore, she built weapons that the Empire used to subjugate the Mandalorians.[4] One of these weapons was the Arc Pulse Generator known as the "Duchess", which was capable of reacting with the beskar alloy inside Mandalorian armor and incinerating the wearers.[1] When Sabine spoke out against the Empire, Alrich and his family stood by the Empire and denounced her. Sabine subsequently fled into hiding and later joined the rebellion.[4]
            Sabine's actions undermined the political position of Clan Wren. To guarantee the cooperation of the remaining Wrens, Alrich was made a hostage of Governor Gar Saxon, the Imperial–appointed Viceroy of Mandalore and the Emperor's Hand. His son Tristan was conscripted into Saxon's Imperial Super Commandos. Alrich's wife Ursa was allowed to continue ruling Clan Wren's domain on the planet Krownest but the family was treated with suspicion and had to go the extra length to prove its loyalty to Clan Saxon and the Empire.[2]
            In 2 BBY, Sabine returned to Krownest to seek her family's help in aiding the rebellion. Countess Ursa initially refused to help since she did not want to endanger her husband Alrich. In an attempt to save her daughter, Ursa tried to turn in Sabine's Spectres comrades Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger to Governor Saxon. However, Saxon reneged on the deal and ordered his men to destroy Clan Wren. Fortunately for the Wrens, Kanan, Ezra, and the Journeyman Protector Fenn Rau helped the Wrens to fight off Saxon's Imperial Super Commandos. Sabine defeated Saxon in lightsaber combat but spared his life. When Saxon tried to murder Sabine, Ursa killed him instead. Saxon's death sparked a Mandalorian civil war.[2]
            After Clan Wren assisted the rebels during the Battle of Atollon, Clan Wren and the Spectres took part in a joint operation to liberate Alrich, who was imprisoned at a prison outpost on Mandalore. Before Sabine and her forces attacked the prison outpost, Gar Saxon's brother and successor Governor Tiber Saxon ordered that Alrich be transported to the capital Sundari for a public execution. By the time Ursa had obtained this information, Sabine had already departed.[1]
            Sabine's joint Mandalorian-rebel force backed by Lady Bo-Katan Kryze's Nite Owls later ambushed the Imperial convoy transporting Alrich above a canyon. Observing the approaching column, Rau deduced that Alrich was in the middle Imperial Troop Transport. While Sabine, Rau, Kanan, and Lady Bo-Katan attacked the convoy's speeder bike escorts, Ezra climbed onto the transport. After throwing out the drivers and the guards, Ezra freed Alrich from his restraints. After clarifying that he was with Sabine but not romantically, Ezra gave Alrich his jetpack. While Alrich rocketed out of the transport before it fell into a chasm, Ezra used his Force powers to Force jump out of the transport.[1]
            Alrich reunited with his daughter. However, this victory was overshadowed by news that Ursa and Tristan's forces had been annihilated by the weapon known as the "Duchess". Fortunately for the Wrens, Ursa and Tristan managed to take shelter. After rescuing Ursa and Tristan, Alrich and the others evacuated aboard one of Lady Bo-Katan's starships. During the journey to Bo-Katan's camp, Alrich learnt about Sabine's role in creating the "Duchess". When Sabine's rebel friend Ezra suggested that the Mandalorians construct their armor out of something different from beskar alloy, Alrich and the others looked with shock.

            During the Galactic Civil War, sometime after the Battle of Yavin, General Oleson served on an unidentified planet as the commanding officer of the New Academy for Space Pilots.[2] When Luke Skywalker joined the Planetary Pioneers to train with them, Oleson was his favorite flight instructor at the academy.[1]
            At some point, Princess Leia Organa came to visit the academy and Skywalker told her about the work of the Planetary Pioneers. However, the tour was interrupted by an emergency siren and the two of them raced to the office of General Oleson. There, the general explained that a small moon from a nearby system had been blasted out of its orbit and was on a collision course with the planet housing the academy. Oleson wanted to call an evacuation, but knew that they would be unable to evacuate everyone in time. Only Skywalker's brave effort to destroy the maverick moon with Zukonium rays saved the planet and the academy.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Oleson</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascOleson</string></dict>

        <key>Ric Olié</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.482.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ric Olié was a human male starship pilot who served in the Royal Naboo Security Forces. He was the commander of the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps, and the leader of Bravo Flight. Olié's talents also landed him the job of the Queen's personal pilot, often flying the Naboo Royal Starship in the service of Padmé Amidala. Due to Naboo's pacifistic nature, Olié's skills were rarely in use, although he saw military action during the Invasion of Naboo. Following the battle, Olié suffered an inner-ear injury and was eventually succeeded as Naboo's royal pilot by Daneska Varbarós.
            By the time that Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation, his only superior in the Royal Naboo Security Forces was Captain Panaka. Towards the beginning of the invasion, Olié, along with the rest of his pilots, were captured and arrested by Federation forces when they swept into Theed. Their Queen was also arrested, and Naboo was subjugated swiftly by the droid army. However, they did not anticipate the intervention of two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who were able to rescue the Queen, her entourage, Olié, and his pilots. Olié had no time to comprehend what was going on, as he was quickly ushered into the Queen's Royal Starship, and ordered to set a heading for Coruscant.[2]
            Escape would not come easily, as the Federation's blockade would provide Olié with a significant challenge. He was flying an unarmed transport against a fleet of heavily-armed capital ships. Although he tried his best, the ship sustained heavy damage during the escape, and lost its shield generator. R2-D2, one of the ship's astromech droids, repaired the shields, which allowed Olié to pilot the ship through the blockade to safety.[2]
            During the escape, the hyperdrive suffered enough damage to prevent the ship from finishing the journey to Coruscant. Kenobi suggested that they land on Tatooine, a desert planet, and purchase the parts needed to make repairs. Qui-Gon Jinn, the Queen (in disguise), the Gungan, Jar Jar Binks, and R2 set out to look for the parts. After a few days, they returned with both the parts and a new member of the group—nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker, an aspiring pilot. Olié took to the boy and offered him a few short lessons in starship piloting. When the Queen's pleas with the Galactic Senate to send aid to her besieged planet went unheeded, she decided to return and take matters into her own hands. Olié flew the group back to Naboo to confront their Trade Federation adversaries. Olié's skills, combined with a lessened Trade Federation space presence, allowed them to land on the planet with enough time for Amidala to contact the native Gungans to enlist their help.[2]
            The Queen had a plan—the Gungan Grand Army would assemble and draw the droid forces out of Theed, she and Panaka would then sneak into the city and capture the Viceroy of the Trade Federation, Nute Gunray, and Olié and his pilots would attempt to knock out the Droid Control Ship. Destroying the ship was the key to deactivating all droid units and saving the outmatched Gungans.[2]
            When the Queen and the Jedi liberated Theed's hangar, Olié and his pilots sprang into action, clambering into their N-1 starfighters and setting out for the Droid Control Ship.[2] The Federation launched Vulture droids in attempt to counter the Naboo offensive, and succeeded in destroying many of the N-1 fighters. Only upon reaching the enemy ship did Olié realize that the deflector shield was too strong, and that the battle seemed hopeless. Just when it seemed as though the Naboo fighters would fail in their mission, the Control Ship started to explode from the inside to Olié's surprise as none of the Naboo fighters managed to hit it. To his surprise, a fighter flew out of the exploding ship piloted by Anakin Skywalker who had inadvertently joined the battle, landed inside the ship and damaged the main reactor. As the Droid Control Ship exploded, Bravo Flight jubilantly returned to their liberated homeworld to celebrate. He later attended the funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn.[2]
            At some point after the battle, Olié suffered an inner-ear injury that made it difficult for him to leave atmosphere, though he was still able to fly under the clouds. By 28 BBY, Daneska Varbarós had succeeded Olié as Naboo's royal pilot.[3]
            Olié was a very vocally observant man, and had a reputation among his peers as the one most likely to point out the obvious.[source?] He was a naturally gifted pilot and could pilot any craft on Naboo. He was reverent towards his Queen and always respected her decisions.[2] Although he followed Panaka's orders, Olié's opinions were always respected.[4]
            Ric Olié first appeared as a supporting character in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, where he was portrayed by Ralph Brown. Ric Olié is referred to by some fans as "Captain Obvious" due to dialogue that simply states well-observed facts, such as "There's the blockade!," "That's it… Tatooine," and "We didn't hit it!"[5][6][7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ric_Oli%C3%A9</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRicOlie</string></dict>
        <key>Ferus Olin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.483.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ferus Olin was the Human Jedi Padawan of Jedi Master Siri Tachi. Considered very mature for his age by many Jedi, Olin was well-respected for his dedication to the Jedi Order. He often clashed with fellow Padawan learner Anakin Skywalker, who disagreed with his strict adherence to Jedi rules and protocol. The two and their masters, Tachi and Obi-Wan Kenobi, often worked together on missions, traveling to such varied worlds as Radnor, Euceron, Andara, Typha-Dor, Romin, Falleen, and finally, Korriban. Many of these missions were orchestrated with the goal of capturing the escaped scientist and criminal Jenna Zan Arbor, who the Jedi later discovered was working with Granta Omega, the murderer of the Jedi Council member Yaddle. However, Zan Arbor consistently eluded them.
            Shortly before the onset of the Clone Wars, Olin resigned from the Jedi Order due to the guilt he felt over the inadvertent death of fellow Padawan Darra Thel-Tanis on Korriban, where Omega was finally killed in battle with Kenobi present. Eventually, he befriended Roan Lands on Bellassa, and the two started a business together— Olin and Lands.[5] Olin and Lands would produce fake, brand-new identities for anyone that wanted to escape from the empire. Olin grew fond enough of Bellassa to adopt it as his homeworld.
            Soon after the execution of Order 66, Olin founded a rebel organization on Bellassa in opposition to the Galactic Empire, newly in control of the galaxy. He would later retrain himself in the Jedi ways with the aid of Obi-Wan Kenobi, one of the few Jedi to survive the Great Jedi Purge. Olin also created a safehouse for fugitive Jedi on an asteroid hidden within an atmospheric storm. Here he would begin to form the early stages of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. During his search for Jedi refugees from the Empire, he was blackmailed into aiding Emperor Palpatine, but would act as a double-agent, seeking information and attempting to undermine the Empire from the inside, eventually confronting Darth Vader himself. His resistance movement spanned the galaxy from Bellassa, Acherin, Coruscant, Naboo, Samaria to Alderaan as well as other planets. This lasted until the Empire thwarted his plans for early rebellion by destroying his secret asteroid base. He eventually accepted a mission from Obi-Wan to watch over Princess Leia Organa on Alderaan where he would reside for many years until Darth Vader killed him a year after that planet was completely destroyed.
            Olin first worked closely with Anakin Skywalker in 27 BBY during a mission to evacuate the planet Radnor when the release of a deadly airborne toxin left many of its citizens unable to flee in the face of near-certain death. The two were sent to the planet along with their Masters, Siri Tachi and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and four other Jedi — Ry-Gaul with his apprentice Tru Veld, and Soara Antana with her Padawan Darra Thel-Tanis. During the mission, the Masters and Padawans were forced to separate, since there were not enough bio-isolation suits to enable all of the Jedi to investigate the area already afflicted by the toxin. Left to their own devices, the more experienced Padawans Olin and Skywalker quickly clashed over issues of leadership.[3]
            Despite these tensions, the four Jedi were able to cooperate well enough to gradually discover the explanation for the release of the toxin. While tracing a group of raiders who were ransacking the homes of fleeing civilians to steal their valuables, the Padawans discovered that the criminals had managed to obtain the evacuation schedule for the citizens of the still-unaffected city of Tacto, enabling them to steal from the fleeing citizens in a suspiciously organized and efficient manner. This information, combined with Skywalker and Veld's discovery that the planet's communications were being jammed from orbit rather than suffering from malfunction, led them to deduce that the natives of the neighboring planet of Avon were planning to invade Radnor, using an offer of assistance in the evacuation as a smokescreen to allow them to land an army of battle droids to quickly conquer the planet. The Jedi teams thwarted the invasion and exposed Galen, the Radnoran scientist who had originally developed the toxin, as a traitor, but Skywalker and Olin remained at odds even after their success. At the end of the mission, Olin, distrusting his fellow Padawan due to the desire for control he had shown, warned him that he would watch him in the future, further infuriating Skywalker and cementing the two apprentices' rivalry and mutual dislike for one another.[3]
            Several months later, in 26 BBY, the two apprentices met again, along with their masters, at the Galactic Games on the planet Euceron. The Padawans, joined by fellow apprentice Tru Veld, helped their masters to discover a plot to rig the games. When Skywalker discovered that an illegal podrace was rigged in favor of one competitor, he decided to compete in it to discover how the race would be manipulated and who was behind it. Olin opposed this plan, believing that Skywalker was racing as much for the thrill as for the mission's success, and his opinions irritated his rival. Skywalker did enter the race, but discovered that he was the racer with the advantage rather than Hekula, the son of his former podracing rival Sebulba. However, he narrowly escaped death when his pod was sabotaged in an attempt to force a dramatic crash into the crowd. Unable to prove the corruption and crimes of the celebrity athlete Maxo Vista and his confederate Liviani Sarno, head of the Games Council, the Jedi left Euceron with a hollow victory and mutual feelings of animosity between Olin and Skywalker still lingering.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ferus_Olin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFerusOlin</string></dict>
        <key>Nico Okarr</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.484.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nico Okarr was a male Human smuggler captain who achieved great fame in the years before the start of the Great Galactic War. He was captured during a smuggling run on the planet Korriban in 3681 BBY, but played a pivotal role in helping Satele Shan and Jace Malcom escape the returned Sith Empire's subsequent attack. He escaped custody shortly afterward and seemingly vanished, but thanks to an artifact he found on Korriban, Okarr survived for decades without aging a day. In 3632 BBY, he was recruited to aid the Alliance against the Eternal Empire, looking no older than he did almost half a century earlier.
            Nico Okarr was one of the most celebrated mercenary spacers in the Outer Rim Territories in the years before the return of the Sith Empire and the start of the Great Galactic War. His debts were as legendary as his deeds, leading Okarr to take the most high-risk and even-higher-reward jobs available in the underworld. No matter the odds, he always delivered the goods, and every criminal syndicate from the Hutt Cartel down competed for his services.[2] At some point he stole engine schematics from a Valahari noble to sell to his competitor and used them to upgrade his XS stock light freighter Redshifter in process.[3]
            In 3681 BBY,[4] an astromech droid T7-O1 was assigned by Jedi Master Ven Zallow to work undercover as Okarr's co-pilot and mechanic. While attempting to smuggle Sith artifacts off the Sith homeworld of Korriban, Okarr and Teeseven were captured by Republic forces over the planet. The Republic arrested Okarr and impounded the smuggler's ship the Korriban's orbital security station. However, Okarr's transfer to a holding cell by Zabrak Jedi Master Kao Cen Darach, his Padawan Satele Shan, and two Republic troopers was interrupted by the arrival of the Sith Empire. A massive fleet arrived in-system and launched an offensive against the station, intending to retake their homeworld. When the Jedi Master decided that the Galactic Republic needed to be warned of the Sith's return, Okarr volunteered the Redshifter to help them escape and used his two custom blaster pistols to help the Jedi fight off the Sith. After they defeated the Sith troopers guarding the hangar, two Sith Lords named Vindican and Malgus arrived. While the Jedi confronted the Sith, Okarr and Jace Malcom, the only remaining Republic trooper, prepared the ship for departure. The smuggler instructed Teeseven, who had been on-board the ship performing maintenance, to prepare the ship's weapons in preparation for their escape. While Master Darach stayed behind to duel the Sith, his Padawan Satele Shan boarded the ship as it was taking off under the orders of her Master. Okarr then told Shan and the trooper to mount the laser turrets to defend against the Sith interceptors. After precisely maneuvering through a Sith battlecruiser, Okarr activated the ship's hyperdrive and jumped to hyperspace to make their escape.[1]
            Okarr delivered Shan, Malcom and T7-O1 to warn Coruscant of the danger, after which he promptly escaped custody again and his trail went cold. With no sightings of him in decades, everyone eventually assumed that Okarr had died, though there was no official record of it.[2] At some point Nico Okarr settled on a "vacation" on Molavar, spending his time in the Sarlacc and Loaded cantina under alias "Snare". Eventually, he was approached there by Seamus Kaldo and his bodyaguard Vhonu, who were looking to hire "Snare" to help them locate Nico Okarr and extract vengeance on him for stealing schematics from Kaldo's father many years ago. After confirming that Kaldo has the money on his person, "Snare" accepted the job and revealed himself as Nico Okarr, asking his payment for delivering the target to Kaldo's table. Having no intentions to pay the man he was going to bring to justice, Kaldo asked his bodygard to stun Okarr, but Nico saw this a breach of contract and shot both men on stun setting. He then retrieved his payment from Kaldo's unconcious body and departed Molavar, abandoning "Snare" as the alias.[3]
            By 3632 BBY, almost fifty years after being last seen in the larger galaxy, Nico Okarr was touring the cantinas in the Spire, the capital city of the Unknown Regions planet Zakuul. Rumours of his stay there reached smuggler captain Hylo Visz who was a member of the Alliance that opposed Zakuul's Eternal Empire. Visz asked the Alliance Commander to investogate the rumours, who managed to track down and approach Nico Okarr in the Platform 6 cantina in Zakuul's Old World. The smuggler recognized the famous galactic figure, but was unable to remember their name on the spot. He was then inquired about how he managed not to age in almost half a century and implied that a relic from Korriban might be involved. Okarr than asked his potential employee to make him a drink to show their character. Approving of their choice of ingridients, Okarr agreed to work for the Alliance and piloted Redshifter to the Alliance base on Odessen. There, he worked alongside underworld logistics specialist Hylo Visz[2] and later helped defend the Alliance base during the Assault on Odessen by Eternal Empress Vaylin.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nico_Okarr</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNicoOkarr</string></dict>
        <key>Ledre Okins</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.485.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ledre Okins, a Human male, was one of the oldest admirals in the upper echelons of the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War. A by-the-books officer, Okins obtained his ranking through years of strict loyalty to the Empire and by simply following orders, rather than by taking great risks or being a tactical genius. Okins' loyalty came to the attention of Emperor Palpatine, who frequently dispatched Okins to lead task forces of fleet commanders who were not following Imperial regulations. Everything Okins observed he reported back to the Emperor.
            In 3.5 ABY, shortly following the Battle of Hoth, the Dark Lord Darth Vader tasked Okins with overseeing the destruction of a secret Rebel Alliance shipyard in the Vergesso Asteroids from aboard Vader's personal flagship, the Super Star Destroyer Executor. Okins successfully led a fleet that included the Executor and three supporting Star Destroyers in a tremendous rout of the Rebel shipyard, destroying hundreds of vessels in a great victory for the Empire.
            Okins died two years later, in 5 ABY, at the hands of New Republic Admiral Willham Burke, who was jointly spearheading the New Republic's drive into the Core Worlds to retake the Imperial capital planet, Coruscant, following the deaths of the Emperor and Vader at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. An extended campaign of raids and feints between the two admirals along the Perlemian Trade Route culminated when Burke tricked Okins into dividing his fleet by sending key forces to the Pindra system, allowing Burke to finally destroy Okins at Colla in a major New Republic victory.
            Ledre Okins[1] was a highly-placed Imperial Navy admiral during the Galactic Civil War.[4] Okins toiled through years of loyal service to the Empire to reach his position, but his rise through the ranks was not marked by ambitious allies looking to use Okins to further their own standing. Rather, Okins established himself on merit alone,[3] by demonstrating daily competence and simply following orders,[4] and he owed neither favor nor loyalty to anyone but the Empire itself.[3] As a result, Okins was older than many admirals in the Imperial Navy's higher echelons.[4]
            Okins' unwavering loyalty to the Empire brought him to the attention of Emperor Palpatine, who considered Okins the perfect lackey to do his bidding. The Emperor often assigned Okins to lead small task forces to eradicate pirates or subjugate planets. Typically, Okins was given authority over a fleet commander who had skirted Imperial regulations and acted on ego and ambition, and an officer finding himself serving under Okins knew that everything that happened would be reported back to the Emperor.[3]
            On occasion, Okins was even assigned to some of the Emperor's most trusted advisors, including the Dark Lord Darth Vader, to ensure his master's wishes were carried out.[3] Shortly following the Battle of Hoth[5] in 3 ABY,[6] Vader returned to the Imperial capital planet of Coruscant aboard his flagship, the Super Star Destroyer Executor, to make his report to the Emperor regarding his encounter with his son, Luke Skywalker, on Bespin's Cloud City.[5] Vader brought Okins along with him so that Admiral Firmus Piett, the Executor's commanding officer, could stay with the Imperial Death Squadron, Vader's fleet, to continue the Empire's hunt for the Rebel Alliance.[7]
            In 3.5 ABY,[8] Okins was present on Coruscant when the Empire learned of the presence of a flourishing Rebel shipyard in the Vergesso Asteroids, which had been operating under Imperial noses. The Emperor tasked Vader with the responsibility of personally overseeing the shipyard's destruction, against Vader's own preference. Vader did not consider it necessary that he go along for the assault, believing any half-competent line officer could see it through to successful completion, so he selected Okins to join him in command of the Executor for the expedition. Outside the Imperial Palace in Coruscant's Imperial City, Vader ordered Okins to assemble a task force in preparation.[9] Supporting the Executor would be the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Avenger and two Victory II-class Star Destroyers, the Victory 1 and the Victory 2.[10]
            Nearly a standard week after earning the assignment, Okins and the Executor arrived in the Lybeya system of the Bajic sector, home of the Vergesso Asteroids. The Rebel shipyard, a giant asteroid housing hundreds of docked starships undergoing repair, provided less than a challenging operation. Nevertheless, Vader ordered Okins to open fire as soon as the fleet reached optimum distance, wanting no mistakes. Before Okins could bring his task force to engage the shipyard, however, several Rebel capital ships emerged from behind the asteroid to meet the Imperial attackers, and suddenly Okins was faced with a far greater challenge than simply eliminating a repair yard.[9]
            The Rebel capital ships included two EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates, vessels once belonging to the Empire but which had since fallen into Rebel hands. Okins remarked to an angered Vader that at least the stolen frigates, originally equipped to support Imperial starfighters, would not be unleashing any TIE Fighters upon them. Nevertheless, on cue the Rebel frigates deployed a dozen X-wing fighters to meet the Imperial task force, to the annoyance of Okins. He ordered the Executor's TIE operations officer to scramble their own fighters in response, not caring to waste the Executor's firepower on such insignificant targets. Still, the presence of Rebel fighters proved enticing to Vader, who chose to join the battle in his own custom TIE interceptor, despite Okins' voiced reservations, leaving the destruction of the shipyard solely in the admiral's hands.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Okins</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLedreOkins</string></dict>
        <key>Kendal Ozzel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.486.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kendal Ozzel was a human male officer who served the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire in turn. Born on the planet Carida prior to the rise of the Empire, he served in the Republic Navy as a commissioned officer during the Clone Wars—a civil war fought in the galaxy during the last years of the Republic. After the war, his military career would continue under the new regime established by Emperor Sheev Palpatine.
            As an admiral, Ozzel was the commanding officer of the Executor—an Imperial Navy Executor-class Star Dreadnought and the flagship of the Sith Lord Darth Vader—at the time of the Galactic Civil War. In the year 3 ABY, he oversaw the initial attack on Hoth after the Empire discovered the location of the Rebel Alliance's secret base, but was summarily executed by way of the Force as a result of Vader's displeasure in the admiral's fundamentally incompetent tactics. Following Ozzel's death, his rank and command were awarded to his captain, Firmus Piett, by the Dark Lord.
            A male human born into a wealthy family from Carida, Kendal Ozzel attended multiple Core World institutes in his youth. Eventually, he graduated and became a Captain of the Line. However, his superiors did not see him fit to serve as an effective field commander, and he was relegated to teaching positions for a while.[6]
            Ozzel served for a time in the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars.[4] Eventually, he ended up serving in the navy of the Galactic Empire. In 14 BBY, he held the rank of Rear Admiral, and was a member of the Joint Chiefs.[5]
            Following the destruction of the First Death Star, he had become an Admiral. He personally issued a communique to the Imperial Starfleet ordering the fleet to enter battle readiness.[7] After this occurred the Hijacking of the Executor, in which the Sith Lord Darth Vader dispatched the scientist Cylo, who had attempted to steal the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor. The SSD was originally designed to be given to Grand General Cassio Tagge, however, Emperor Sheev  Palpatine demoted him to General, and gave the Executor to Vader, due to Tagge's trust of Cylo. Vader force choked Tagge on his new command ship's bridge in front of Ozzel. Vader asked him when the Executor would be ready, and gave him two weeks, after Ozzel replied he needed a month.[8] After Captain Magna Tolvan failed to capture Chelli Lona Aphra, who was investigating the Great Temple, Ozzel contacted the captain, and warned her that Vader would be less forgiving of failure than Cassio Tagge, her former commanding officer.[9]
            Sometime later, Ozzel along with General Veers, met with Vader at his castle on Mustafar. As the Sith Lord looked out over the world's landscape, the admiral relayed how the Death Star's destruction had galvanized the rebellion. Resources for the Empire's construction projects were being delayed and what Rebel forces there were were too scattered and well hidden to make effective progress against. Ozzel went on to suggest that a fleet carrying out a world-by-world bombardment would serve as a suitable deterrent and told Vader that the Death Squadron had to be the force that applying the bombardment. Just as he was saying it was ludicrous to not use the fleet, Vader interrupted him by questioning the admiral's usage of the word ludicrous.[10]
            After apologizing, Ozzel went on to question how they could eliminate the Rebels, comparing them to vermin. Veers then spoke up and contradicted the Admiral, instead comparing them to weeds. Angered, Ozzel kept his gaze on Veers as the general explained how weeds survive storms and how the Rebellion would continue to survive Imperial attacks as they were flexible and not as sturdy as a tree. Turning his attention back to Vader, Ozzel addressed the Sith Lord after he showed interest in what Veers had said.[10]
            He later became the commanding officer[2] of the Death Squadron, an armada of Imperial vessels[11] tasked with locating the Alliance's hidden main base in the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin, though the fleet was under the de facto control of Vader. In his capacity as admiral of the fleet, Ozzel led Death Squadron from Vader's flagship, the Executor.[2] As he had been assigned to oversee the Empire's search for the Rebel headquarters, Ozzel felt that he was the perfect being to command the massive warship during the hunt.[3] During his time as the senior officer aboard the Executor, Ozzel took time to personally congratulate Lieutenant Commander Ciena Ree, a young officer whose service had been outstanding for the past two years. After commending Ree for her dedication, the admiral implied that she might obtain a promotion to the rank of Commander soon enough.[12]
            The Empire dispatched thousands of probe droids throughout the galaxy to participate in the search for the Rebel base, one of which discovered signs of an occupied settlement on the ice planet Hoth. Before being destroyed by Rebel Captain Han Solo, the droid relayed its data to the Executor, where it was reviewed by Admiral Ozzel, his subordinate, Captain Firmus Piett, and General Maximillian Veers of the Imperial Army. Piett cited the data as their best lead in the search, but Ozzel dismissed the information as lacking definitive proof of any Rebel presence. Nevertheless, Vader overruled him and ordered the fleet to make haste to the Hoth system to deal with the Rebels headquartered there.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kendal_Ozzel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKendalOzzel</string></dict>
        <key>Meck Odom</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.487.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Meck Odom was a Human male Imperial officer who served the Galactic Empire and later joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. He was assigned to the research facility on Danuta. He was an extremely spiritual person and a supporter of the B'omarr Order.
            Odom was once the best friend of Kyle Katarn when they were roommates during their tenure at the Academy of Carida. Odom's parents and sister came to his graduation and invited Katarn (who was alone) to stay with them that night. Katarn had a crush on Odom's sister. Later, while Katarn was on a mission to steal the partial set of Death Star plans from the city of Trid, he encountered Odom before infiltrating the research facility. Odom was persuaded to shut down the base's outer perimeter, allowing Katarn an easier entry. During the skirmish, the two staged a blaster shot that wounded and rendered Odom unconscious, hoping that this would remove Odom from suspicion.
            It is unknown whether Odom was implicated in the Danuta incident, whether he was able to defect to the Rebellion, or whether he continued to serve the Empire during the Galactic Civil War. At the time, Odom was not entirely certain he had done the right thing—his true loyalty was to saving lives, not to the Empire or Rebellion—but he comforted himself with the knowledge that only time would tell.
            Meck Odom was portrayed in Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama by Kale Brown, the same voice actor who portrayed Biggs Darklighter in the Star Wars radio drama.[source?] He is mistakenly called "Odom Meck" throughout the audio dramatization and is listed by the mistaken name on the Dark Forces: The Collector's Trilogy audio drama box.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Meck_Odom</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMeckOdom</string></dict>

        <key>Didi Oddo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.489.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Didi Oddo was the adoptive father of Astri Oddo[3] and onetime owner of Dex's Diner. He was a good friend to the Jedi, including Yoda, Tahl and Qui-Gon Jinn.[1] When his daughter married Bog Divinian, he sold his café to Dexter Jettster.[4] He owned a small retreat in the Cascardi Mountains.[1]
            Didi Oddo was known as an informant on Coruscant and good friend of the Jedi Order, especially Qui-Gon Jinn. When Obi-Wan Kenobi met him, Didi had recently received a datapad from a thief called Fligh, who had stolen it from a senator, Uta S'orn. Then a bounty hunter, Ona Nobis, almost killed Didi trying to get the datapad; Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn stopped her.
            After the attack, Didi and his daughter, Astrid, hid in his home in the Cascardi Mountains, but Ona Nobis found them and poisoned Didi. So Astri had to steal the antidote in a lab from Jenna Zan Arbor to save her father.
            Didi Oddo was taking illegal bets during the Galactic Games on Euceron during 26 BBY. Obi-Wan Kenobi had to help Didi when Didi first said that he bought a swoop bike that broke and Uso Yso wouldn't give him his credits back. Obi-Wan Kenobi was asked to stand next to Didi to frighten Uso Yso, but it failed.[4]
            Obi-Wan Kenobi soon found out that Uso Yso was in charge of illegal bets for the Galactic Games and that Didi was taking illegal bets. Didi said he took credits from his daughter Astri and his son-in-law Bog Divinian because he wanted to place a bet when he got a sure tip. Didi soon stole Bog Divinian's speeder to sell it, and then he placed another bet with that money. Obi-Wan Kenobi asked him why he did that, and Didi said that an event was fixed and that it was a sure thing. Didi got the information from Fligh, whom Obi-Wan Kenobi did not trust at all.[4]
            After talking with Fligh, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Didi Oddo took an air taxi, but the pilot jumped off mid-flight. They made it and went to Stadium Five, where the Alderaan pilot won the race and Didi could have made a fortune. Later, Obi-Wan Kenobi needed Didi as a witness, but it turned out that he left Euceron. Astri Oddo said, "...Didi wanted to help, but Bog said he would press charges for the theft of the speeder. So Didi thought it best to leave the planet. You know he has no moral courage..."[4]
            After the events of Stadium Five, Didi Oddo retreated to his home in the Cascardi Mountains.
            Didi died sometime during the Clone Wars.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Didi_Oddo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDidiOddo</string></dict>
        <key>Barel Ovair</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.490.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Barel Ovair was a prestigious Human male Jedi Master and scholar of the Old Republic. He was the scion of a respected line of Jedi Knights who were all secretly spies working for the Emperor of the Sith Empire. Ovair took Eison Gynt, a highly skilled Nautolan Padawan and a fourth-generation Jedi, as his apprentice, but abandoned him during a mission to the tomb of the Sith Lord Naga Sadow on Yavin 4. When Ovair returned to Coruscant alone weeks afterward, he claimed that Gynt had been killed. However, Gynt resurfaced on Coruscant years later, possessed by Sadow's spirit and determined to kill Ovair. Ovair defeated Gynt in combat, slaying him, and was lauded as a hero for his triumph. It was not until many years later that the Jedi historian Gnost-Dural connected Ovair and his family line to the Sith Emperor.
            Barel Ovair was a Human male Jedi Master from a respected family line of Jedi. Secretly, he and his family were spies working for the Sith Empire in the years prior to the outbreak of the Great Galactic War.[2] In his role as a Jedi Master, Ovair took a talented young Nautolan named Eison Gynt, a fourth-generation Jedi Knight, as his Padawan.[1] As fellow Jedi scholars,[2] Ovair and Gynt traveled the galaxy, studying the Force and taking on increasingly daring tasks for the Jedi Order.[1]
            Their career together culminated with an ambitious mission in 3756 BBY to explore the tomb of the Sith Lord Naga Sadow on Yavin 4.[2] This was ostensibly to rid the temple of dark side energies for the good of the Order, but in truth Ovair was under orders to eliminate any remnant of Sadow's power, which the Sith Emperor viewed as a potential threat to his planned invasion. During the mission, Ovair and Gynt were attacked by Massassi warriors and were forced to go deep within the tomb. Ovair returned to Coruscant weeks later without his Padawan, incoherent and injured. After recovering from his ordeal, Ovair reported to the Galactic Senate that Gynt had been killed during the mission. However, Gynt was in fact still alive and had fallen under the influence of Naga Sadow's spirit.[1]
            Gynt resurfaced on Coruscant several years after the failed mission to Yavin 4,[2] dressed in Massassi warrior robes and possessed by the spirit of Sadow. After finding his former Master, Gynt attacked him in full view of the public eye. While Gynt's borrowed dark side abilities were formidable, the undercover Sith defeated and killed Gynt. Ovair was interviewed by the Jedi High Council after the duel, but his triumph was praised and he came under no suspicion. Indeed, he was hailed as a hero by the Galactic Republic for his actions. Over a century later, Jedi historian Gnost-Dural questioned why the spirit of Sadow would have sought vengeance against Ovair specifically, and made the connection between Ovair and the Sith. He realized that Ovair and his Jedi ancestors were in fact spies working on behalf of the Sith Emperor. The historian deduced that Ovair had used Gynt to draw out Sadow's spirit to eliminate it prior to the invasion of the Republic.[1]
            Ovair operated simultaneously as a Jedi scholar and as a Sith infiltrator for decades without detection by the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic. This role was one he inherited from his father and his grandfather. On behalf of the Sith Empire, and ostensibly the Jedi Order, he undertook many daunting missions, such as the one to Naga Sadow's tomb on Yavin 4. Ovair had fair skin with brown hair and eyes, although his eyes would turn orange-yellow when his corruption by the dark side of the Force was revealed.[1]
            When the spirit of Naga Sadow possessed Gynt, who had been considered the most promising Padawan in the Jedi Order at the time of his selection, Ovair was still able to overcome the formidable dark powers of Sadow occupying the body of such a talented Jedi. Ovair's skills at subterfuge were sufficient to conceal his identity until years later when reviewed by Jedi historian Gnost-Dural; this would suggest a skill of Force stealth on a considerable scale, hiding his dark side signature as he resided within the walls of the Jedi Temple. Ovair wielded a purple double-bladed lightsaber.[1]
            Barel Ovair was first introduced in a timeline entry for the Star Wars: The Old Republic video game.[1][2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Barel_Ovair</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBarelOvair</string></dict>
        <key>Jaller Obrim</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.491.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jaller Obrim was a lifelong police officer on the galactic capital of Coruscant. During his career, he served as a Senate Guard, a Coruscant Security Force officer, and a member of the Imperial Security Bureau. In 22 BBY, Obrim lived with his wife, Telti, and two sons in the Rampart Town section of Galactic City. He was a close friend of Mandalorian Sergeant Kal Skirata, as well as the clone troopers whom Skirata had trained as clone commandos and ARC troopers. Dedicated to his job, his friends, and his family, Obrim worked to protect Coruscant and its inhabitants.
            Obrim began his career as a Senate Guard and earned a reputation as a skillful detective and a hard-nosed cop. After the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, Obrim was transferred to the Coruscant Security Force. His high position in law enforcement as head of the CSF's Anti-Terrorism Unit allowed him to divert CSF resources to Skirata's black ops missions for the Grand Army of the Republic and make their actions disappear from official records. Obrim was instrumental in providing Skirata and his team of clone troopers with support during a top-secret mission on Coruscant that targeted a Separatist cell. Obrim also assisted Skirata on a personal level in the retrieval of clone commando RC-8015 and Republic Treasury Agent Besany Wennen from an armed standoff in the Republic Central Medcenter. When Order 66 was issued, condemning several of Skirata's friends as traitors to the Galactic Republic, Obrim assisted the Skirata clan in escaping Coruscant. After the Clone Wars, Obrim and the Anti-Terrorism Unit were transferred to the new Imperial Security Bureau. From this new position, Obrim provided support and information to Skirata, his clan, and other anti-Imperial resistance movements.
            Jaller Obrim was a Human male police officer on the galactic capital planet of Coruscant. He served as a Senate Guard for twenty-eight years and eventually attained the rank of commander. During his time as a Guard, he protected senators and other high-ranking government officials. He additionally conducted criminal investigations and gained a reputation as a smart, no-nonsense street cop. By 22 BBY, he lived in a residence in the Rampart Town section of Galactic City on Coruscant with his wife, Telti, and two teenage sons.[6]
            During the Clone Wars, which began in 22 BBY,[3] Korun terrorists under the leadership of Nuriin-Ar seized the Galactic City Spaceport and took several hostages, including Senator Meena Tills and her aide, Vun Merett Jai. The terrorists demanded that the Galactic Republic withdraw its forces and cease interference in the affairs of their homeworld, Haruun Kal. The Senator's involvement prompted Obrim and a Senate Guard detachment to respond to the hostage crisis, as did the Coruscant Security Force, the clone commando unit Omega Squad, Mandalorian Sergeant Kal Skirata, and Null ARC Captain Null-11, nicknamed "Ordo."[1]
            Jedi Master Kaim attempted to negotiate with the Korun terrorists, but they killed him and threw his body, strapped with explosives, outside of the spaceport. Clone commando RC-8015, nicknamed "Fi," jumped onto the Jedi before the explosion went off, an act that saved the lives of the CSF police officers standing nearby. The hostage siege was brought to an end as the commando team forcefully entered the building and killed the terrorists.[1] Fi survived the blast, and his heroism was remembered by Obrim and the CSF for a long time thereafter.[5]
            After the siege, Obrim was seconded to CSF's Anti-Terrorism Unit and given the rank of captain. In 21 BBY, during one of their first meetings at the CSF Staff and Social Club since the spaceport hostage siege, Obrim and Skirata discussed an upcoming black ops mission by Omega Squad, Captain Ordo, and Jedi Knights Bardan Jusik and Etain Tur-Mukan to uncover a Separatist terror cell on Coruscant. Skirata's and Obrim's friendship had grown, and Skirata knew he would need the help of the Anti-Terrorism Unit in order to complete the mission successfully.[3]
            Throughout the black ops mission, however, Skirata was hesitant to give Obrim detailed information for fear of having it leaked and threatening the safety of his team. Likewise, Obrim wanted to protect his men from getting killed by unknowingly interfering with the clones, who were in disguise as arms dealers. At one point, Skirata and Obrim argued and almost came to blows over the issue of sharing information. Skirata eventually agreed to share information on locations his team would hit or observe, but only to warn off the CSF from interfering with those spots. Later, Skirata revealed the locations of the terrorist cells, giving Obrim and the CSF an active part in the end of the mission. After Skirata and his team were successful in neutralizing the main terrorist team, Skirata gave Obrim the all-clear, and Obrim, along with the CSF, arrested or killed more than ninety other suspects.[3]
            On a mission to Gaftikar, clone commando Fi sustained a serious brain injury and was taken to Coruscant's Republic Central Medcenter. Kal Skirata asked Republic Treasury Agent Besany Wennen to keep an eye on Fi, and she discovered that the medical droids intended to euthanize Fi since they had declared him brain-dead. Wennen threatened the medical droids with her blaster, forced them out of Fi's hospital room, and shot the lock to seal herself and Fi inside. In the resulting standoff, Skirata called Obrim for a rescue, and Obrim responded with several CSF patrol officers and half of the shift from the Anti-Terrorism Unit. In a large display of weapons and armor, Obrim and the CSF stormed the hallway and escorted Wennen and Fi out of the room. When they reached the lobby, they were stopped by a medical droid who insisted they had no right to remove the unconscious Fi. Threatening that he would release embarrassing information about the droid's boss, Obrim was able to secure Fi's release. Along with Wennen, they left the medical center under the loyal and watchful gaze of the CSF officers whose lives Fi had saved during the Galactic City Spaceport hostage siege. Fi was taken to Obrim's apartment, where he was cared for by a medical droid Obrim had rented. Fi was later covertly moved to the planet Mandalore.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jaller_Obrim</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJallerObrim</string></dict>

Since Oviedo's loyalty was already in question, however, they decided to conduct a staged attack to reconfirm his standing in the Republic.
            Oviedo's ship managed to land on the remote moon of Asturias, as did a handful of clone commandos assigned to protect him.

        <key>Oberk</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.493.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Oberk was an Imperial scout trooper and a corporal at the time of the Battle of Endor.
            Oberk was originally from the planet Ukio, and was known as a show-off. He was transferred to scout trooper duty when it was discovered he could skilfully pilot a 74-Z speeder bike.
            During a tour of duty on Endor, Oberk encountered and held Rebel operative Leia Organa at pistol-point and, after Oberk ordered his comrade to ready his speeder, Ewok Wicket Wystri Warrick, with whom Organa had recently become acquainted, attacked Oberk with his spear. Oberk was momentarily distracted before Organa bludgeoned him with a branch and knocked him unconscious.
            The character of Oberk first appeared as a scout trooper extra in the film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, released in 1983. Prior to the film, in the Return of the Jedi novel released earlier that same year, an unnamed scout trooper with Oberk's role appeared. He is alone when capturing Leia Organa, has different dialogue in the scene, and Organa kills him with his own blaster after Wicket Warrick attacks him. The film's script, featured in The Art of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays and Star Wars: Behind the Magic, refer to him as "Scout #1." In 1999, Oberk was given a name and a brief backstory in the Endor Limited edition of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Oberk</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascOberk</string></dict>
        <key>Lune Oddo Divinian</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.494.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lune Oddo Divinian was a Force-sensitive Human male who was the son of Astri Oddo and Bog Divinian. During the early years of the Galactic Empire, Divinian received basic training in the ways of the Force as well as the tenets of the Jedi Order by fugitive Jedi Masters Ry-Gaul and Garen Muln. After both mentors were killed, Divinian lived on as a mercenary until eventually joining the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Lune Oddo Divinian was the son of Bog Divinian and Astri Oddo and was born on the planet Nuralee in 27 BBY. For reasons unknown, Divinian's sensitivity to the Force was not detected at birth, therefore missing an opportunity to study as a member of the Jedi Order. During Divinian's formative years, his father was elected Senator of his homeworld and the family began to spend time on Coruscant where Divinian stayed in the care of his grandfather, Didi Oddo. Around this time Divinian's mother began to note her son's affinity for using the Force, keeping this fact a secret from her husband who loathed the Jedi Order and Force-users. Despite her efforts, Senator Divinian witnessed his son's talents and he began to plot ways to exploit his son.[1]
            As Divinian's father began to become more hostile his mother gathered a few belongings and the mother and child fled to the planet Samaria to live in relative peace. During the years that followed the Clone Wars erupted between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Republic, but the two managed to avoid the atrocities of war. When the Republic and the Confederacy came out on the loosing end of the war and the Galactic Empire rose to galactic dominance Divinian's father, Bog Divinian was assigned to the Samarian government as an Imperial Advisor. Realizing the danger they were in, Astri Oddo approached the Samarian Prime Minister Aaren Larker from who she learned of her estranged husband's plot to capture their son and turn him over to the Empire for education at the Imperial Academy. With stolen codes to a Platform-7 supercomputer, Astri Oddo was able to sabotage the equipment and escape the planet with her son.[4]
            Not only the Empire was interested in Divinian and his mother after the disabling of the platform; the family was approached by former Jedi Padawan Ferus Olin in the following weeks and was impressed by the boy's abilities that he exhibited.[4] Olin agreed to take the pair to his secret asteroid base far from the eyes of the Empire, where former Jedi Master Garen Muln assisted Divinian in learning to use and control the Force.[3]
            During their stay on the asteroid, the Divinian's grew comfortable with their fellow refugees living in relative safety and peace. However, when Trever Flume returned to the base with activist Flame, Astri Oddo began to think that their sanctuary could wind up targeted by the Empire sooner then expected. Fearing for her son's safety, the two departed the asteroid and went to Coruscant under the guardianship of Jedi Master Fy-Tor-Ana and Clive Flax. Seeking out the Dexter Jettster, an operative working against the Empire, Divinian's mother hoped that the Besalisk could get them off planet and too a safe world. While his mother met with Jettster, Divinian went to a park with Keets Freely and Curran Caladian where he modified the power slide to shoot him up higher and did somersaults with the Force. Detecting the boy's use of the Force, a squad of passing stormtroopers attempted to seize Divinian but were unable to get to him before his guardians were able to make an escape. The escape was short-lived however; the stormtroopers managed to capture the boy and he was escorted to the Imperial Naval Academy nearby where his father was awaiting him.[5]
            At the Academy, Divinian began being indoctrinated in Imperial Naval life. After spending some time at the academy, Trever Flume was enlisted to rescue him. In one class, they were able to best one of the older cadets, Kestrel; however, Divinian's father received word from Senator Sano Sauro that Darth Vader needed someone for a "special project." When Bog Divinian decided to send his son, both Divinian and Flume tried to escape but were caught by Maggis, the head instructor. The two were separated and Divinian met with his father again who turned him over to Vader for the project. As Divinian was escorted off the premises with Vader, the boy was made aware that he was to be a test subject for a memory-altering drug created by the scientist Jenna Zan Arbor. Before the drug could be applied, Divinian was rescued by Ferus Olin and, after jumping from a window, they were both rescued by Flume and a defective Maggis. Safely away from his father and Vader, Divinian then returned to the asteroid to continue his training with Master Garen Muln. Peace was short-lived once more, as Vader led an assault group against the asteroid. Before the base and all its occupants were destroyed, the three Jedi stationed there loaded Divinian into an escape pod, ensuring that he would live to grow and carry on their cause.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lune_Oddo_Divinian</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLuneOddoDivinian</string></dict>
        <key>Nash Windrider</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.495.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nash Windrider was a human male from Alderaan who served as a commander in the naval forces of the Galactic Empire. He attended the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant, and was roommates with the Jelucani cadet Thane Kyrell and Coruscanti Ved Foslo. He also had feelings for Ciena Ree, who was in love with Thane. After graduation, he was assigned to the Devastator. While aboard the Death Star, he witnessed the destruction of Alderaan, which wiped out his entire family and profoundly affected Nash. However, he ultimately chose to remain in the Empire, justifying Alderaan's destruction by claiming it was necessary in order for the Empire to bring order to the galaxy.
            As a member of the Imperial Navy, Nash fought against the Rebel Alliance on several occasions including the Battle of Hoth. He later fought against his former friend Thane in a dogfight; he was shocked to find Thane alive, having believed Ree's fabrication that Thane had committed suicide. Ree thwarted Nash's attempt to kill Thane, and Nash comforted her after the battle, enraged by his belief that Thane had faked his death and tormented them all those years.
            Nash survived the cataclysmic Imperial defeat at the Battle of Endor and participated in the Battle of Jakku, where he was devastated when Ree ordered him to abandon the Inflictor. Following the events at Jakku, Nash was made the commander of an attack cruiser and was privy to a planned Imperial offensive against the New Republic, the government that had been established by the Rebel Alliance. Believing that Ree had perished during the Battle of Jakku, he nominated her for the Distinguished Medal of Imperial Honor posthumously.
            Nash Windrider was an Alderaanian human male who lived during the Age of the Empire. Nash grew up on the Core World of Alderaan where education was free and people were encouraged to learn and grow. His father made carpets for a living.[1]
            In his youth, Windrider was an Imperial cadet at the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant, which prepared cadets for a career as officers in the Imperial Navy. During his first day at the Royal Academy, Nash met his two room mates: the Jelucani youth Thane Kyrell and the Coruscanti Ved Foslo. While Nash quickly befriended Thane, he found Foslo arrogant and aloof. After introducing himself to Thane, Nash remarked that they should introduced inhalers and tranquilizers for the benefit of newcomers visiting Coruscant.[1]
            For the next three years, Nash and his fellow cadets endured the Royal Academy's punishing education regimen, which involved hours of studying science, mathematics, piloting, and physical training. Cadets were frequently subjected to a battery of tests that pushed them to their limits. While Windrider's friend Thane found the Academy a liberating experience from his domineering parents, Nash found the Royal Academy's curriculum a grueling experience; coming from Alderaan which had a more enlightened and holistic approach towards education. Despite these challenges, Nash persevered in his training due to his belief that the Galactic Empire was a positive force that wanted to bring the best of every world and culture to the galaxy. When Thane expressed his cynicism, Nash invited him to visit his homeworld.[1]
            In spite of their different outlooks and Nash's untidiness, he and Thane became good friends at the Royal Academy. On one occasion, Nash and his fellow cadets took part in a training exercise that involved them riding on speeder bikes through a series Reitgen Hoops. Prior to the exercise, he asked the Flight commander whether there would be a prize. The commander calmly replied that he should first learn the task before he could "presume to perform it." Ultimately, Thane and his fellow Jelucani friend Ciena Ree jointly won the race after their bikes became entangled. As he became more acquainted with Thane, Nash learned about his friend's abuse at the hands of his father Oris Kyrell after seeing the scars on his back.[1]
            Six months later, Nash and his fellow cadets were working on a laser cannon assignment. After finishing his work, Nash tried to convince Thane to explore the Coruscant nightlife. However, Thane was too preoccupied with his assignment and insisted on putting in the extra effort to maintain his class rankings. Unable to convince Thane, Windrider then teased him about his "feelings" for Ved Foslo before turning his attention to Thane's relationship with Ciena. Windrider's interest in Thane's close friendship with Ciena annoyed the latter who refused to discuss the topic. Despite their quarrel, Nash remained supportive of Thane during the "laser cannon" incident. When Nash suggested that Ciena had a role in sabotaging Thane's laser cannon, Thane insisted that Ciena was innocent.[1]
            Nash Windrider graduated from the Royal Imperial Academy shortly before the battle of Yavin. He was assigned to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Devastator which took part in the capture of the Alderaanian Princess Leia Organa.

        <key>Nok Drayen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.498.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nok Drayen, was a Human male crime lord whose operations during the Great Galactic War made him an underworld legend, and also a leading member of the fabled Star Cabal. Born the grandson of King Arak Drayen III of Dubrillion, he was the father of Risha, his heir to the throne.
            During the Great Galactic War, Drayen, until then a small-time smuggler, rose to galactic infamy when he destroyed the shadowport of Mandellia and killed the thousands of pirates and gangsters who resided there with a single shot.
            Dropping out of hyperspace in his freighter, Drayen broadcast a demand that the settlement's residents surrender to him. When they refused, he fired a proton torpedo loaded with a nerve toxin stolen from the Imperial Navy, which slew every last resident in minutes. Drayen then plundered the accumulated wealth of his victims, becoming one of the wealthiest criminals in known space and using the proceeds to establish his own syndicate.
            Drayen's ruthlessness in the accumulation of underworld influence was legendary, and he was credited with having slain half the members of the Hutt Cartel in a single night, with none ever able to discover the method behind his feat. Having been granted control over an entire quadrant of the galaxy by the Cartel as a peace offering, he later consolidated his power and added to his infamy when he personally destroyed the Rath Cartel and the Vandelhelm Combine during the Syndicate Wars.
            During this period, Drayen began a longstanding rivalry with his contemporary, Diago Hixan, as the two competed across the galaxy to commit the most spectacular crimes and claim the greatest treasures, although Drayen always came out on top in their clashes. The conflict became personal when Drayen seduced Shassa Dalle, Hixan's beloved wife, and more so after one of Hixan's many unsuccessful attempts to win her back ended in her accidental death.
            Drayen was present for a business meeting held at the Star Cluster Casino on the smuggler's moon of Nar Shaddaa in 3653 BBY. He and several other individuals were meeting to discuss their interests and how those interests would change now that the Sith Empire had forced the Republic to sign the Treaty of Coruscant. As the meeting was called to order, Drayen exposed Naatu for providing information to the Republic and proceeded to draw his blaster and execute him. He then introduced the Sith Lord Darth Angral, who was there to make the group a proposition.
            After the bounty hunter, Braden, escaped from imprisonment on a Sith warship, he returned to Nar Shaddaa to gain Drayen's assistance. He agreed on the condition that Braden help him with some of his business in exchange.
            In 3653 BBY, as the Cold War dragged on, Drayen was betrayed by one of his lieutenants, infected by a devastating disease. It ate away so much of his skin, along with his right eye, that he had to place the infected areas with cybernetics. It resulted little, however, for the disease would destroy his organs. Drayen executed the traitor, along with all his other lieutenants, just to be thorough.
            Drayen tried asking the Jedi Order for help, but they were "uncooperative." As a result, he killed three of them so that he might learn what "secrets" they might have had.
            Drayen was secretly frozen in carbonite by his Selkath doctor, Chelah, so that he could "cheat" death for as long as possible. From there, his daughter Risha would keep him around with her for ten years.
            In 3643 BBY, Risha partnered with a smuggler to find Nok Drayen's treasure, all the while as Risha keeping her father's existence secret. However, they needed upgrades for their ship and once they had them all, Risha decided it was time to tell the truth. She brought Nok Drayen's carbonite block to Nar Shaddaa, where Doctor Chelah would unfreeze him.
            During the brief father-and-daughter reunion, it was a matter of time before the illness reached the mighty Drayen's heart, so he urged Ace to hurry, promising all but one treasure is their's to take. Ace returned with the lockbox containing Dubrillion's treasures, the most important being the lost crown of Dubrillion, to find him dying, which Drayen opened with the code his father taught him. With death looming over him, Drayen told Risha to take the crown, and take back the throne of Dubrillion for herself. However, if she was to succeed, she would have to do many questionable things, and ordered her to kill the smuggler, whom he deemed irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, thus going back on his original promise. She refused, and with his dying words, he told Risha how disappointed he was in her, and succumbed to his illness. Subsequently, Risha ordered Chelah to dispose of her father's body as per his will and released the Selkath from her family's service.
            While not afraid of anyone, Drayen was careful not to cross Harridax Kirill, alias the "Voidwolf."
            Nok wore an overcoat similar to the one Cade Skywalker would wear thousands of years later. He also wore glove spikes on his gauntlets and possessed a blaster pistol.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nok_Drayen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNokDrayen</string></dict>

        <key>Novar  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.501.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Novar was an Onderonian politician and Sith initiate in the years leading up to the Great Sith War. Born into one of the wealthiest families in the Onderonian capital city of Iziz, Novar quickly became a high-ranking member of the Onderonian government after graduating from Ov Taraba university. He mastered the tactics of Onderonian ministers, and eventually formulated a scheme to eliminate his superior, Tolo Kad. Novar framed Kad for failing to plan a dinner party that the Onderonian monarchs, King Ommin and Queen Amanoa, were to attend. His plan went off perfectly, prompting an enraged Ommin to destroy Tolo Kad with the dark side of the Force. Ommin's display of power fascinated the Force-sensitive Novar, who manipulated the King into training him to harness dark side, and Novar eventually became a minor Sith wizard. When Ommin and Amanoa formed a Sith cult worshiping the deceased Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd, Novar was given a high position in the cult's hierarchy.
            In 4000 BBY, a group of three Jedi Knights, consisting of brothers Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, and Twi'lek Tott Doneeta, arrived on Onderon on a mission to broker peace in the long-running Beast Wars between Iziz and the Beast riding outcasts. Novar welcomed the Jedi, bringing them before Queen Amanoa in the Iziz Royal Palace. However, a group of Beast Riders attacked the palace and absconded with Princess Galia. The Jedi were sent to retrieve her, but returned at the helm of a Beast Rider army, as they had discovered the presence of the dark side in the Onderonian monarchy. Novar fought in the ensuing battle, even shooting off one of Cay Qel-Droma's arms with his blaster. Nevertheless, the Beast Riders were victorious, and although Amanoa was killed in the battle, Novar was able to escape. He eventually returned into the service of King Ommin. In 3998 BBY, Novar and Ommin were visited by Satal and Aleema Keto, heirs to the throne of the Empress Teta system. The Ketos brought with them a Sith spellbook, which Ommin gave to Novar for translation. Soon afterward Ommin's subterranean lair was attacked by a team of Jedi, and Novar was killed in the skirmish.
            Novar was born into one of the wealthiest families of the Onderonian capital city of Iziz. Before his twelfth season he had already gained acceptance in the court of King Ommin, ruler of Onderon. Novar spent more than twelve years studying diplomacy at the university of Ov Taraba, one of the most prominent and expensive institutions of learning on Onderon. Due more to his father's connections than his own accomplishments, Novar was appointed as the assistant to Tolo Kad, King Ommin's aide, after his graduation from Ov Taraba.[1]
            Now an official part of the Onderonian government, Novar learned much about the art of politics from his superior, Tolo Kad. While he was Kad's assistant he became a master in political methods, including espionage, the spreading of disinformation, and the holding of secret meetings. Novar also had the ability to mold himself into any role, a skill which allowed him to fool others into believing every word he spoke. He eventually gained the power to arrest and detain any who were at odds with him, and those who continually defied him soon found themselves banished from Iziz. Tolo Kad supported Novar's growth in this area, and often boasted that he taught his charge everything he knew. Over a period of several years Novar took on more and more of Tolo Kad's responsibilities, and every project he undertook was a great success. However, Kad took all the credit for Novar's exploits for himself.[1]
            Novar eventually devised a plan to rid himself of Tolo Kad. At the time, Kad had bragged about an upcoming state dinner that he claimed he had personally planned and arranged, although Novar was the one who had done all the work. Seeing his opportunity, Novar initiated the final stage in his plan. When the guests for the dinner arrived, they found the Iziz Royal Palace's grand ballroom in disarray; nothing had been prepared, and there were no attendants or guards on hand. Due to these circumstances, the dinner, which would have been attended by King Ommin and Queen Amanoa among others, was postponed. King Ommin, who by that time was frail and weak due to overexposure to the dark side of the Force, was infuriated. As a fascinated and horrified Novar watched, the angered Ommin destroyed Kad with a wave of dark side energy. Due to Kad's death, Novar was promoted to Minister of State and became King Ommin's aide. Novar's plan had succeeded, and he soon found himself gripped by another ambition; to learn to use the dark side.[1]
            Determined to learn to command the dark side, Novar manipulated King Ommin until the king agreed to take him as a dark side apprentice. However, Ommin's health degraded ever more over the ensuing two years, and Novar was forced to look elsewhere for training. To Novar's surprise, Queen Amanoa, also a dark side adept, continued his dark side training. With Amanoa's training, Novar's power grew, and he eventually rose to become a minor dark side wizard. Eventually, Amanoa and Ommin formed a Sith cult that worshiped the fallen Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd. Novar was given a high position in the Naddist cult, and was entrusted with the task of selecting other candidates to join their new Sith society, instructing them in the basic principles and philosophies of the dark side. The most promising students continued on to the next stage of training, learning from the holocron of Adas, an ancient Sith king who used his knowledge of the dark side to subjugate his homeworld of Korriban more than 24,000 years previous. Once Amanoa learned all the knowledge that Adas's holocron had to offer, she gave the holocron to Novar to train the best of his students.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Novar_(Human)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNovar</string></dict>
        <key>Lorian Nod</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.502.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lorian Nod was a male Human Jedi serving the the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a member of the Agricultural Corps following his expulsion from the Coruscant Jedi Temple's academy in the decades preceding the Clone Wars. Nod eventually turned away from the Order to become a pirate on the Outer Rim of the galaxy before achieving elected office on the planet Junction V.
            A Force-sensitive Human born on the planet Junction V in 102 BBY, Lorian Nod was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. As an Initiate in the Temple's academy, Nod was sorted into a clan of his peers where he became quick friends with fellow student, Dooku. As a student, Nod possessed no personal lightsaber, and had plans on becoming a Jedi Consular upon achieving knighthood. Training for over a decade in each other's company, Nod was jealous of Dooku when he was selected in 89 BBY by Jedi Master Thame Cerulian to continue his training as a Padawan. In the days following Dooku's apprenticeship, the pair investigated Cerulian's private chambers while the Corellian Jedi was away on a mission.[1]
            Eager to learn about the Jedi Master, the pair discovered several documents and journals, including one which contained information drawn from a Sith holocron that was stored in the Holocron Vaults of the Temple Archives. Fascinated by the device, Nod attempted to convince Dooku to help in gain access to the device. Citing the regulations of the Archives and the Vaults, Dooku refused his friend and chastised him for broaching the subject. Undeterred, Nod slipped into the Vaults and stole the Dark Holocron in secret, accessing its hidden knowledge within his own chambers. Sickened by the dark side of the Force which was imbued in the holocron, Nod came to Dooku for help. As Dooku scolded his friend for stealing the ancient artifact, Jedi Councilor Oppo Rancisis was drawn to the darkness emanating from the room and confiscated the holocron. Nod accused Dooku for stealing the holocron and Dooku, who was shocked by the accusation, was unable to say anything[1]
            In the following days, the Council placed the two former friends on opposing teams during a group exercise through Coruscant. The teams, tasked with obtaining a muja fruit from the Old Galactic Market in the Senate District, eventually crossed paths and Dooku and Nod engaged in a fight. Upon returning to the Temple, the Council called the pair to a meeting, during which Dooku, who was infuriated with his friend's betrayal, explained that Nod was the only one to seek out the holocron and he alone bore the guilt. With this knowledge, the High Council deemed Nod unfit to continue along the Jedi Path at the Temple not for stealing the holocron, but for lying and implicating a friend. Dooku would maintain his apprenticeship with a mild warning to watch his pride.[1]
            Following the High Council's decision, the Council of Reassignment placed Nod in the Agricultural Corps, a division of the Order's Service Corps, where the failed Jedi would stay for the next thirteen years. Eventually, Nod abandoned his post with the Service Corps and became the leader of a band of space raiders along the Outer Rim.[1]
            In 76 BBY, Nod was secretly hired by the Sith Lord Darth Tenebrous to kidnap Senator Blix Annon.[2] During the kidnapping, he encountered an older Dooku, who by then had obtained the rank of Jedi Knight and taken on the training of sixteen-year-old Qui-Gon Jinn. Nod managed to capture the two Jedi on Von-Alai but was unable to keep them; their escape nearly resulted in Nod's death after a brief encounter with an enraged Dooku. Before Dooku could kill him, Padawan Jinn calmed his master and Nod was arrested, tried, and sent to prison.[1]
            Released around 52 BBY after many years imprisoned, Nod returned to his homeworld where he rose to become leader of a group called the Guardians, a group meant to protect the world from the rogue government of Delaluna, Junction V’s moon. With the people in fear of a destructive weapon called the Annihilator, which Nod propagated as being in the possession of the Delalunan government, Nod assumed control of the planet's government for eight years. It was not until Qui-Gon Jinn, now a Master, and his own apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi were passing through Junction V on a stopover during a mission and learned about the supposed threat of the Annihilator that Nod's power was questioned. The two Jedi soon discovered that Nod's rule was built on lies and propaganda and with the help of a woman named Cilia Dil, the Jedi managed to overthrow the leader and once more send him to prison.[1]
            Following a prison sentence of nearly two decades, Nod reconsidered his life and changed his outlook on things. Once released, he returned to Junction V to truly help out its citizens rather than do things for his own gain. Elected through a proper election, Junction V, along with Delaluna and the Bezim and Vicondor systems, created the Station 88 Spaceport under Nod's governance. As the lives of his constituents began to prosper, the galaxy broke out in all out war, as the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems began the Clone Wars. Several weeks[3] after the start of the war, the Confederacy sought to claim the Station 88 spaceport for themselves, given its strategic Mid Rim location. Dooku, now the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, contacted Nod, telling him that with his support, he could convince the leaders of the other worlds controlling the spaceport to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, Nod sought to do the exact opposite, and contacted Grand Master Yoda of the Jedi Order, hoping to redeem himself for all of the terrible crimes he had committed. Nod informed the Order that he would be attending a meeting with the other rulers and Dooku on the Separatist-held world of Null in which he would formally decline the Confederacy's offer.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lorian_Nod</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLorianNod</string></dict>
        <key>Nield</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.503.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nield was a Human male who was one of the teenage leaders of the Young, a youth organization that halted the civil war between the Melida and the Daan on the planet Melida/Daan. Nield was a strict leader, primarily in the way he disciplined the other children. When his ally, Cerasi, was killed, Nield began to hate his comrade-in-arms, Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, the two made up to an extent after the civil war ended. At that time, Nield became one of the three leading members of Melida/Daan.
            Nield's family was part of the Daan people. Nield's mother Leidra and father Micae and his three brothers were killed during the civil war when he was just a child. He was raised by an older cousin, but she died because of the war, too. After her death, Nield didn't have anyone to look after him. He wandered in the streets of Zehava alone for some time, until he met Cerasi, a Melida girl. Together, the two youth decided to unite the Daan and the Melida orphans, to create an organization which would fight for peace, known as the Young.[1]
            After some time, during which the Young fought using guerrilla warfare tactics, the group helped the Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to rescue their fellow Jedi, Tahl. Later, Kenobi choose to stay and fight with the Young.[1] Under Nield and Cerasi's leadership, the Young won the war, and formed a government. Nield was elected as Governor and head of the New History Squad, which began to tear down the Halls of Evidence. Cerasi and Kenobi began to doubt the policy of destroying Melida/Daan's history, no matter how bloody, and moved to stop the destruction.
            Nield felt that they had turned against him. He accused Kenobi of being an outsider, and tried to get enough votes to overthrow the council. The tension came to a peak when the elders and Nield's follower's, both armed, converged on the Halls of Evidence. Kenobi and Cerasi arrived to try and stop the violence, but Cerasi, who was unarmed, was shot and killed.
            Both Nield and Kenobi were deeply disturbed by Cerasi's death, but Nield blamed Kenobi for not getting there faster, mostly because he was afraid that he had himself fired the fatal shot. Soon after, Qui-Gon Jinn returned to Melida/Daan and together with Kenobi, they investigated Cerasi's murder. The duo discovered that a member of the Young, named Mawat, had armed both sides, and placed sharp shooters at the scene, who had killed Cerasi. When Obi-Wan informed Nield of this, they left to try and stop the war being waged in Cerasi's name, although they were unable to halt the violence. Qui-Gon subsequently arrived and produced a holo of Cerasi speaking of peace. Qui-Gon was able to negotiate a cease-fire, and Nield was made one of the three planetary leaders.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nield</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNield</string></dict>

            Niklos was a Human male gambler who resided on the planet Taris during the Jedi Civil War. He was a patron of the Upper City Cantina, where he spent his time playing pazaak. He used to play against fellow player Gelrood, until the latter was banned from the cantina on suspicion of cheating. Following this, Niklos was unable to find a rival who could match his skill in the game.[1]
            In 3956 BBY,[2] Former Sith Lord and redeemed Jedi Revan, who was on Taris in search of Jedi Knight Bastila Shan, visited the Upper City Cantina and bought a pazaak deck from the retired player Garouk.

Once he decided someone was a cheater, he would call them that at every opportunity; he would also refuse to play against them under any circumstance.
            If the player beats Niklos in pazaak 5 times in a row without losing, he will eventually accuse the player of cheating and will refuse to play pazaak anymore.

            During the Cold War, Nefarid was in holoconference with his master and fellow apprentices as his Master Darth Angral's son, Tarnis, armed the Republic's Planet Prison to entrap Coruscant. However, Tarnis was interrupted and killed by Jedi Knight, whom Angral swore revenge upon. Nefarid added that they also control the Republic secret weapon projects for Angral to enact his revenge.
            Upon learning of fellow apprentice Sadic's death on Nar Shaddaa, Nefarid sent a message to the Knight congratulating the Jedi on defeating Sadic, thanking the Knight for eliminating one of his rivals for Angral's favor.[2]
            Nefarid journeyed to Alderaan, serving as an adviser to House Thul. He attacked the research facility where the Death Mark laser controls were being held. Despite Jedi Master Orgus Din's best efforts, the Sith Lord managed to steal the equipment and trapped the Jedi within the facility. With aid of his spy Aleyna Hark, Nefarid tagged and killed whomever he wished. When the Jedi Knight arrived, Nefarid killed Count Alde, the Death Mark's financier, forcing the Jedi to race to Din's location. The Knight then started deactivating the generators powering the Death Mark to take the laser offline temporarily. When the Knight started with the primary generator, Nefarid called via holo, mocking the Knight's efforts by killing an innocent farm girl before the Knight reached the backup generator.
            Nefarid's next target was Duke Horis Thul, an advocate of peace talks, forcing the Jedi to storm his compound to warn him. Despite the initial success, Aleyna managed to tag both Thul and the Knight. However, Thul gave the Knight Nefarid's location. Upon arriving, Nefarid showed the Knight a hologram of Angral executing Din to demoralize his opponent. He then emerged from the shadows and engaged the Knight with his double-bladed lightsaber, all the while using the Death Mark on his opponent. Only the Knight's skill and use of the Force enabled the Jedi to evade the laser while killing Nefarid.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nefarid</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNefarid</string></dict>

            Calder Nettic had a preference for Echani weaponry, keeping a light blaster rifle at his home. He also had a wife according to Rickard Lusoff.[1]
            Nettic ran a small surface-to-orbit transport service with his partner, Rickard Lusoff at Garang Spaceport for over twenty years. At some point he cheated Lusoff on a business deal, which resulted in drunken violence. Jedi Tooka was dispatched to the scene and restored order. He had also had been renting a speeder with Handon Guld, but subsequently had an affair with Guld's wife. These actions angered both Lusoff and Guld to the point of attempted murder. In 3965 BBY, Guld killed Nettic on the Dantooine plains, while Lusoff accidentally shot Guld instead. Several hours later, both men were arrested by Bolook after he and Revan investigated the case and discovered the truth.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Calder_Nettic</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCalderNettic</string></dict>

        <key>Narthax</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.511.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Narthax was a clone stormtrooper from the planet Ukio who served the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. Prior to 3 ABY, he was stationed in the Imperial garrison on the planet Akuria II, and became a veteran of the garrison by 3 ABY. That year, Narthax, by then one of Imperial Supreme Commander Darth Vader's most seasoned and well-trained troops, participated in the Battle of Hoth as a snowtrooper sergeant in Blizzard Force. Commanding a squad during the battle, Narthax took part in invading the Alliance to Restore the Republic's base on the planet, in pursuit of the fleeing Alliance personnel. During the pursuit, the 3PO-series protocol droid C-3PO ripped off the warning label on a pen containing some of the base's captured wampas, and Narthax and his group, upon reaching it, decided to enter the room itself. Narthax entered in the door's lock-code, and he and his squad were subsequently attacked and killed by the wampas inside.
            The Human[4] male[2] Narthax was a clone[5] from the planet Ukio.[1] He served the Galactic Empire[2] as a clone stormtrooper during the Galactic Civil War, a conflict between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[5] For a period of time prior to the year 3 ABY,[3] Narthax was stationed in the Imperial garrison on[2] the ice planet[6] Akuria II.[2] By 3 ABY,[3] Narthax was a veteran of the garrison, and had tested on various frigid worlds. By that time, he was also one of the most well-trained and seasoned troops serving the Imperial Supreme Commander, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader.[2] That year,[3] the Empire discovered the Alliance to Restore the Republic's hidden base located on the planet Hoth, leading to a subsequent ground invasion of the facility.[7] Narthax, a snowtrooper sergeant by then, was part of the assault as part of the Imperial Blizzard Force. He commanded a squad during the battle.[1]
            Narthax was among the stormtroopers who reached the base itself, pursuing the Alliance forces who were desperately evacuating their base. His helmet-mounted sensors ready to catch any unsuspecting Rebels, Narthax and his group ran into a corridor containing a heavily shielded pen where, unbeknownst to the troopers, the Alliance had previously quarantined some of the planet's predatory and carnivorous wampas. The Alliance's 3PO-series protocol droid C-3PO, who was attempting to escape, stopped to tear off the warning label on the door to the pen before disappearing around another bend in the corner. Narthax and his group reached the door, and the Sergeant punched in the code on the door's control panel. The door slid open, and the troops filed in with military efficiency, to be subsequently attacked and killed by the wampas within the room. Darth Vader later reached the room to discover a cave-in exposing the room to Hoth's daytime sun, along with the bodies of Narthax and his squad under piles of blood-stained snow.[2]
            A sergeant in the Stormtrooper Corps, Narthax trained snowtroopers in extreme-weather survival tactics.[1] He was one of Darth Vader's most well-trained and season troops[2] by 3 ABY.[3] When he punched in the lock-code leading to the wampa pen, he savored the moment, believing it would take more than locks to stop the Imperial invasion. He and his group filed into the room with military efficiency, unaware they had stumbled upon the wampas that would kill them.[2] Narthax wore full snowtrooper armor, and his equipment included an E-11 blaster rifle.[1]
            Narthax was originally meant to appear in 1980's Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. His intended scene, which did not make the final cut, involved him and his snowtrooper group being tricked into entering the wampa pen when C-3PO rips off the warning label, and are attacked by the wampas within.[7] In 1996, that scene was first brought into canon by One Step Ahead, a short story in the second edition of Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back.[2] In fall 1998, that deleted scene was described, along with photos showing Narthax and his squad, in the CD-ROM Star Wars: Behind the Magic.[8] In November of that year, Narthax was first identified by name, and his backstory expanded, in a card for the Special Edition Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.[1] In November 2003, his image was used on a card for the Empire Strikes Back set of the Star Wars Trading Card Game, which revealed that he was a clone stormtrooper.[5] In 2011, the deleted scene with the snowtroopers was officially released as part of the Star Wars: The Complete Saga Blu-ray set.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Narthax</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNarthax</string></dict>

            An elderly Jedi at the time of the war against Darth Malak, Nemo was helpful and amiable, despite the troubles of the galaxy at large. Nemo was well informed of the local situation on Dantooine, and appeared quite friendly with the native population. He often played Pazaak in the early morning hours with Aratech employee Karal Kaar.
            Revan once met with Master Nemo as he underwent retraining at the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine. The kind Jedi offered words of wisdom to Revan concerning his final test to become a Padawan. Also, like the Masters of the Council and Bastila, Nemo was well aware of Revan's true identity. He alluded to this when Revan commented on his rather unorthodox name. Nemo responded with "The importance you put in a name is misleading, young one. You of all people should remember that", an allusion to Revan's name change.
            The Council assigned Nemo to investigate the ancient Rakatan ruins on the planet shortly before Revan returned with a redeemed Juhani. Unfortunately for Nemo, he failed to overcome the temple's defenses and was killed by one of the guardian droids.

The droid managed to subdue the guards, and after defeating another officer, escaped with the criminal DJ.
            Nandan Roty[2] was a human male who served as an officer in the city of Canto Bight's police department.[1] In around 34 ABY,[3] Roty joined a game of cards being played by officer Stepheden Thaldree and another member of the department in the jail of the Canto Bight police headquarters. The trio was then attacked by the astromech droid BB-8, who was seeking to free his comrades Finn and Rose Tico from the jail.[1]
            The droid managed to subdue all three officers and tie their hands and feet, also gagging Roty with his gloves. The criminal DJ, who had just released himself from his cell, then discovered BB-8 and his three captives, each of whom gave muffled cries for the criminal to help them. Another officer then discovered the scene, and demanded BB-8 and DJ surrender; however, as Roty watched, BB-8 began launching coins at the officer, who DJ then knocked out with his boots. BB-8 and DJ then successfully escaped from the prison.[1]
            Roty had fair skin, brown eyes and brown hair.[1]
            Roty wore the white, blue and black uniform of the Canto Bight police department, including a betaplast armored collar and neck guard and a black helmet. He was equipped with an electro-shock stun prod, a Relby k-25 blaster, a scrambled long-range comlink and a police glowrod.[1][4]

When the primary bridge of the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus was destroyed, killing almost all of Resistance High Command and injuring General Leia Organa, Namit joined Holdo and several other officers loyal to her in transferring to the Raddus so that the vice admiral could take command of the fleet as the highest ranking officer still able to command.

        <key>Nazhros Oleg</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.516.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Nazhros Oleg was a cadet in Lothal's Academy for Young Imperials. He was assigned to squad LRC077, and was a member of Unit Aurek. Selfish and competitive, Oleg was unable to see the benefits of teamwork, often causing him to butt heads with his teammates. He had a fierce rivalry with cadet Zare Leonis, a member of his unit who was secretly an undercover rebel.
            A male human, Nazhros Oleg was born on the planet Eufornis Minor, a remote world located within the Outer Rim Territories. After the deaths of both his parents, he was raised by his two uncles, who were freight haulers. After learning of new business opportunities provided by Imperial investments on the planet Lothal, his uncles relocated there, bringing an unhappy Oleg along with them.[1]
            Hating life on Lothal and wishing to serve the Empire, Nazhros applied to become an cadet at the planet's Academy for Young Imperials, hoping to get shipped off-world after graduation to attend a senior academy. Oleg was accepted and assigned to squad LRC077. He was a member of Unit Aurek, which included fellow cadets Jai Kell, Zare Leonis, and Pandak Symes. During the initial two-week orientation, Oleg quickly developed a reputation as a bully and regularly picked on Symes, whom he despised as a weakling. Oleg also disliked Zare, a fair-minded cadet who had secretly infiltrated the Academy in order to find his missing sister Dhara Leonis, who had disappeared the previous year.[1]
            During one morning drill, Oleg smirked at Symes when Sergeant Currahee was dressing the latter down. In response, Currahee punished the entire squad by ordering a locker inspection. After inspecting Oleg's locker, she confiscated his flimsi as contraband and issued Unit Aurek three demerits. Following a drill run on the Easthills, Oleg attempted to force Symes to give him his fruit bar and taunted him by telling him that he was going home. Zare came to Symes' defense and slapped Oleg's fork out of his hand. When Oleg threatened Zare publicly in the mess hall, Lieutenant Chiron issued him with two demerits and ordered him to sit down.[1]
            During his time at the Academy for Young Imperials, Nazhros was disliked by his fellow Unit Aurek members due to his selfish and mean-spirited streak. Following their two-week orientation, Oleg and his fellow cadets were issued with white cadet helmets and ordered to keep them on all day except for breaks. Unfamiliar with operating the helmet's audio pickups, Oleg muttered that if he had wanted to study math, he would have stayed at home. However, his remark was heard by Lieutenant Chiron who lectured him that the speakers in his helmet had no volume setting. He then issued the cadet with a demerit.[1]
            Several days later, Oleg and the rest of Unit Aurek participated in a military exercise that involved them deploying from a Sentinel-class landing craft into a lake. After disembarking, the cadets had to reassemble their E-11 blaster rifles and head to a new rendezvous point on foot within the hour. When Zare stopped to help Symes, Oleg taunted Zare for being a "babysitter." Leonis then responded that they were better off as a unit of four. They then participated on an obstacle course which involved them running through broken terrain while Imperial troops fired on them with blasters on trainer setting.[1]
            When Oleg demanded the right to lead Unit Aurek, the other three members voted for Zare. When Leonis ordered his squad to advance in file formation to avoid being detected by the snipers, Oleg dismissed it as a dumb plan. While crawling to their rendezvous point, Pandak sustained a nervous breakdown. While Oleg demanded that they moved on, Zare insisted on helping their fellow comrade. Later, Zare reluctantly joined Oleg and Kell as they proceeded forward only to be intercepted by a trainer. Following the exercise, Pandak volunteered to leave the Academy. To prove that he had been right about Pandak, Oleg lay in the former cadet's bunk. After learning that Unit Aurek would be receiving a transfer trainee, Oleg vowed to bully the new recruit.[1]
            Having survived the first field exercises, Oleg and the other remaining cadets embarked on a series of exercises around the Well, a large training pit that was programmed with many different obstacles and challenges. Their first training exercise involved the cadets climbing onto a structure called the Pillar. During the exercise, Oleg displayed his selfish streak when he refused to work with his fellow squad members. With much difficulty, Oleg and Zare managed to scale the Pillar but were beaten by Cadets de Grom, Wheeler, and Jai Kell. These trainees were rewarded with an extra dessert ration and a free period. Oleg's aversion towards teamwork put him at odds with the other cadets, particularly Zare and Jai. During a second training session, Oleg took advantage of Zare and Jai's efforts to help him by beating them to reaching the top of the Pillar. On a third occasion, Oleg complained about being paired with another cadet named Lomus. As punishment, Sergeant Currahee issued him two demerits.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nazhros_Oleg</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNazhrosOleg</string></dict>

        <key>Matton Dasol</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.518.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Matton Dasol was a male Human starship mechanic living on Kashyyyk in 3956 BBY as an indentured servant of Eli Gand.
            Matton was working for Eli Gand in order to pay off a debt that his crew had incurred while stopping on the Wookiee homeworld. Telling Dasol that the crew had left Kashyyyk without paying the debt and thus marooning him, Gand forced him to pay it off by citing "standard trading rules." In reality, the merchant had tricked Dasol's crew, letting them believe that there was salvage to be had in the arboreal world's Shadowlands; this proved to be a trap, as Eli ambushed and murdered them.
            When Revan and his party arrived on Kashyyyk in their quest to find the Star Maps that would reveal the location of the Star Forge, they encountered Gand and Dasol's small stand, where the two related the circumstances of Dasol's "employment" in a roundabout way that caused Mission Vao to remark that the situation "smelled worse than an overcrowded Ronto stable." As the party made their way through the planet in their search, they eventually came across the remains of Dasol's repair droid, D-A02, whose barely-functional memory banks contained evidence of Gand's treachery. Returning the droid's head to Dasol, the true extent of the crime was revealed and Gand fled to the Shadowlands. Dasol took over the business to earn enough credits for transportation off Kashyyyk. Soon afterward, the Wookiees rebelled and forced all outsiders off the planet.
            After revealing Gand's treachery, the player can either convince Dasol to kill Gand for lying to him, or to simply let the ex-merchant flee to the Shadowlands. Either way, Dasol will take over the operation and reward Revan with credits and a small discount. If the player convinces Dasol to let Gand's stand rot, Dasol says he will take what he needs from the store, and let the rest rot like a corpse. Dasol then gives the player a Mandalorian assault rifle.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Matton_Dasol</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMattonDasol</string></dict>

By 13 BBY, Munbrin was stationed in Coronet Spaceport, where he encountered the future smuggler Han Solo. Munbrin gave Han the surname Solo.
            Drawd Munbrin served as a chief recruitment officer in the Galactic Empire.[2] His work consisted of enrolling recruits who desired to join the Imperial Armed Forces into the Imperial Academies.[1]
            In 13 BBY, Munbrin was stationed in Coronet Spaceport enrolling the potential recruits for the Empire. One day, a young man named Han appeared and was interested in joining the Empire and becoming the best pilot in the galaxy. When Munbrin asked Han his surname, Han stated that he didn't have one and indicated to the officer that he was alone. Munbrin decided to assign Han the surname "Solo" and sent him on his way to academy on Carida.[1]
            The story of how Munbrin gave Solo his surname was made known. A Snivvian bounty hunter, however, believed the story of Munbrin's encounter with Solo to be deliberate disinformation and believed instead that Solo was a direct descendant of the Prince-Admiral Jonashe Solo, a member of the ancient Corellian royalty. A Crimson Dawn enforcer, on the other hand, believed that Solo was the grandson of the Corellian pirate Dalla Suul and that Munbrin misheard his surname when recruiting him.[3]
            Drawd Munbrin first appeared on the 2018 Star Wars Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story, played by Andrew Woodall.[1] In Star Wars Legends, "Solo" wasn't a nickname but the real surname of Han.[4]
            Munbrin's line when he gives Han his surname was the first line written for the film's script back in 2012 when Lawrence Kasdan pitched the film to Disney CEO Bob Iger some weeks before The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm Ltd. While he was talking with Simon Kinberg and Michael Arndt, Kasdan told the pair about the moment when Han gets his name and how it happens.[5]
            Going by the Imperial rank chart created by Dave Crossman for use in both Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Solo: A Star Wars Story, Munbrin would be a captain of the Imperial Navy.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Drawd_Munbrin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDrawdMunbrin</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Mortis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.520.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Mortis was a Human male Sith Lord who served on the reconstituted Sith Empire's ruling Dark Council during the Cold War with the Galactic Republic. One of the twelve Dark Lords of the Sith who sat on the Council, Mortis presided over the Sphere of Laws and Justice. Mortis trained at least one Sith apprentice, Zavrasha, and he was committed to ensuring that the Treaty of Coruscant remained in place, though he assumed a leadership role alongside Darth Marr and Darth Ravage as the Dark Council's numbers thinned throughout the Galactic War with the Republic.
            Darth Mortis was a Human male who had risen to the rank of Sith Lord in the resurgent Empire by the time of the Cold War with the Galactic Republic. The older man was sufficiently powerful enough to be granted a seat on the Empire's ruling Dark Council, and as one of the twelve Dark Lords of the Sith[5] he controlled a Sphere of Influence within the Empire: specifically, Mortis controlled the Sphere of Laws and Justice. As head of the Sphere, Mortis was charged with overseeing the Imperial justice system and those branches of the Empire that maintained the law within its society.[3] By the end of the Cold War, Mortis had also begun training a Sith apprentice named Zavrasha, and he dispatched her to the neutral moon of Nar Shaddaa in order to ensure that Admiral Ange's efforts there did not endanger the peace brought about by Treaty of Coruscant.[4] The Sith Lord Darth Gravus, who was placed in charge of the invasion of Taris, was a political ally of Mortis.[6]
            As the Galactic War broke out with the Republic, Darth Mortis and the other members of the Council were summoned by fellow Councilor Darth Baras to their meeting chamber on Korriban. Darth Decimus, Hadra, and Acharon were overseeing the Battle of Corellia, so the three attended via hologram. Darths Marr and Ravage were present on Korriban with Mortis, where Baras attempted to declare himself the Voice of the Emperor—the public extension of the Sith Emperor's will and thereby the ruler of the entire Empire. However, Baras was interrupted by the arrival of Darth Vowrawn and Baras' former apprentice. The Sith Warrior, who had been appointed as the Emperor's Wrath after Baras had betrayed his student, battled the false Voice before the rest of the Council.[5]
            After the Wrath killed Baras, Darth Vowrawn led Mortis and the others in acknowledging the truth of the Emperor's support for the warrior, accepting that the Wrath was not bound by the Council's wishes. When the Wrath departed, Darth Thanaton brought his own matter before his fellow Councilors: the head of the Sphere of Ancient Knowledge was engaged in a Kaggath, an ancient Sith ritual duel, against his rival and subordinate Lord Kallig. After being bested by Kallig on Corellia, Thanaton appealed to Mortis, Ravage, Vowrawn, and Marr to eliminate the upstart slave, though the other Dark Councilors refused to interfere when Kallig arrived to continue their battle. After Kallig defeated Thanaton and forced him to submit, Mortis rose from his seat and apologized to his fellow Councilor before breaking his neck with the Force. Acknowledging Kallig as the victor, the four Dark Councilors present rewarded the young Sith Lord with Thanaton's now-vacant seat on the Council, and they brushed off the newly-appointed Darth Nox's question when the Emperor would meet with the Council. As the Council adjourned, Mortis advised Nox to return Dromund Kaas and ensure the loyalty of their followers, promising to summon Nox the next time the Dark Council congregates.[5]
            After the Battle of Corellia ended with a Republic victory and the deaths of Decimus, Hadra, and Acharon, the Dark Council was angered to learn that the Sith Lord Darth Malgus declared his own empire on the planet Ilum—an empire that did not discriminate against alien species and was not beholden to the political infighting that the current Empire was. Mortis assumed a leadership role on the Council along with Marr and Ravage, dispatching Grand Moff Ilyan Regus and Darth Arho, Baras' successor as head of the Sphere of Military Offense, to conduct the campaign against both Malgus and the Republic there.[7] Mortis and the other Councilors would later meet in their chambers beneath the Imperial Citadel on the capital of Dromund Kaas to debate who would succeed Darth Hadra as the head of the Sphere of Technology, and Mortis was one of several Councilors who refused to support Darth Marr's candidate, the Falleen Darth Karrid. Mortis believed that the Empire was wrong in adopting Malgus' policy of allowing aliens to join their ranks, and he proposed the Human traditionalist Darth Gravus in opposition to Karrid. To that end, he tried to convince the rest of the Council to grant Gravus a seat once he reclaimed the mineral-rich world of Leritor.[6] After Karrid disposed of Gravus, Mortis chose to support Karrid, admitting that he had underestimated her.
            During Makeb invasion by the Hutt Cartel, Darth Mortis summoned an Imperial individual to assist him against The Shroud, a spy who wanted to plan a rogue attack on Dromund Kaas. The Dark Councilor introduced Evie Bo, the ex top-lieutenant of The Shroud, to the Imperial individual who gave him the microbinoculars in order to find another lieutenant in the city and stop The Shroud. After neutralizing the Shroud lieutenant, the Imperial individual traveled across the galaxy to uncover the Shroud's plan. The trail eventually lead to Nar Shaddaa, where Bo and the Imperial individual uncovered the Shroud's plan to launch a ship through hyperspace into Kaas City. The Imperial individual managed to thwart both the attack and kill the Shroud, or so it seemed. When the individual returned to Dromund Kaas, the Shroud hijacked Mortis' holofrequency, revealing that a double was killed in his place. Before signing off, the Shroud used a trigger phrase to activate a neural scrambler in Bo's brain, erasing her memory. As Mortis managed to get through, the individual convinced an amnesiac Bo that she is a servant of the Empire.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Mortis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthMortis</string></dict>
        <key>Morlish Veed</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.521.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Morlish Veed was a male Human who served as an Imperial High and Grand Moff, as well as Grand Admiral and one of the foremost leaders of the Fel Empire around 130 ABY until he reached the rank of Lord Regent of the Sith-controlled Empire during the Second Imperial Civil War in 137 ABY. After the death of Darth Wyyrlok and the reappearance of Darth Krayt, Veed was removed from his position as Regent. Veed remained Krayt's lead military officer and commanded the assault on the Hidden Jedi Temple and coordinated the defense of Coruscant when it came under assault by the allied forces of the Empire-in-exile and the Galactic Alliance Remnant. Veed was killed during the battle by his former lover, Nyna Calixte.
            Veed originally served onboard the ship Wesk Herf. He was regarded as a military genius and an even more astute politician, being the only person to hold the rank of Grand Admiral while also serving as the head member of the Moff High Council. As such, he was second in rank only to Emperor Roan Fel, and harbored barely-hidden ambitions toward replacing Fel on the Imperial throne.
            He was also the lover of Moff Nyna Calixte, the Director of Imperial Intelligence, who left her husband, Moff Rulf Yage, for Veed. When the Sith approached her with an offer to cooperate in conquering the Galactic Alliance, he quickly became involved in their plans. Like Darth Krayt, Veed believed that the galaxy needed to be united under the leadership of a single strong ruler; however, he believed that he should be that man, not Krayt.
            He served as the Supreme Commander in the Sith–Imperial War from his flagship, the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer Imperious, and commanded the decisive Battle of Caamas. This earned him the rank of High Moff. However, the remnants of the Alliance fleet, led by Admiral Gar Stazi, were planning of escaping. Veed entrusted Dru Valan to prevent this but the GA forces escaped through a spacer route. Veed reported the final victory over the New Jedi Order to the Emperor and the Moffs in the throne room on recently-conquered Coruscant—which served as the signal for Darth Krayt and his Sith to attack the guard detail of Imperial Knights and slay the Emperor.
            For a moment, Veed believed that he was about to become the first ruler of a united galaxy in more than a century—only to watch as Darth Krayt settled down casually in the throne, and proclaimed himself the new ruler of the Empire. The Sith Lord invited Veed, as the senior member of the Imperial hierarchy, to be the first to swear loyalty, and the Grand Admiral, inwardly reluctant, complied. Despite the fact that his plan to become Emperor had temporarily failed, Moff Calixte quickly reminded him that he could still sit upon the Imperial throne in the future. Veed appeared to have been unaware that the real Roan Fel had survived the assassination attempt, and that the man slain by Krayt had merely been his double.
            Seven years later, when word spread that a Skywalker had survived, Veed thought of capturing him and turning him to his side. But when Morrigan Corde failed and the Sith called off the search, as they had captured him, Veed still refused to give up.
            The Moffs then began to argue whether or not Skywalker had been captured and whether or not they should reassert their authority like back in the days of the Remnant until Veed dismissed all points. He later went to Calixte's apartment, discussing on how to obtain Skywalker.
            Veed later assigned Morrigan Corde to retrieve Cade Skywalker from the Temple of the Sith, but for a price. In addition, she wanted three dozen Yuuzhan Vong Thud Bugs the Imperials just confiscated from Black Sun. Veed agreed to these terms, and even intended to personally deliver the Vong Bugs to her, however Calixte found out and took over the job of delivering the bugs, knowing Veed was attracted to Corde. When she had approached him at his apartment, he had tried to seduce her.
            Veed saw the explosions resulting of Corde's attack on the Sith Temple and when Skull Squadron attacked the Mynock near it, Veed ordered Moff Yage to call them off citing Sith orders that no ship was to trespass their airspace.
            After Skywalker's escape from Coruscant, Veed spoke to Calixte outside her refresher, wondering how to explain to Krayt why they pulled back the squadron, though he was pleased on the damage done to the Temple. He then noticed a holographic choker that he had never seen before. Calixte told him it was a family heirloom. In reality, it was a holo of Kol Skywalker with his family — Corde and Cade. Also unknown to Veed was that Nyna Calixte and Morrigan Corde were actually the same person.
            Veed and Calixte later heard that Krayt was wounded during an attempt on his life. They also heard Darth Wyyrlok would be serving as leader of the Empire until Krayt - who was actually dead, having being killed by Lord Wyyrlok himself - had recovered. Veed and Calixte both suspected something more was going on, and became determined to uncover the truth.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Morlish_Veed</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMorlishVeed</string></dict>
        <key>Morit Astarte</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.522.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Morit Astarte was a male human born to the Astarte line of Celanon during the last years of the Galactic Republic. He was the twin brother of Aiolin Astarte.
            Morit was born, along with his twin sister, Aiolin, into the Astarte line of Celanon either before or during the Clone Wars. His family financially backed research of Doctor Cylo during this time. However, they sided with the Separatists during the war and, fearing the retribution of the new Galactic Empire, they gave their two children over to Cylo's care.[3]
            Some weeks[5] after the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader captured and killed Cylo-IV,[4] after learning of Cylo's existence from Darth Sidious.[6] Vader set out to Cylo's research base[4] and stormed it with two platoons of BX-series commando droids. Shortly before, Cylo had assigned Morit and Aiolin to await their next test in the dojo, without telling them Vader had arrived to eliminate them as his rivals. The twins quickly destroyed one platoon of battle droids just before Vader entered the dojo. Aiolin informed her brother that the droids weren't a test: Vader had come.[2]
            Morit was pleased, and used his implants to close the door behind Vader; cutting him off from his droids. The twins attacked the Dark Lord using their lightsabers. Vader quickly realized Morit and his twin were able to execute Force-like abilities, even though he sensed the Force was very weak within them. Vader added that Morit was evidently neither Jedi or Sith. Morit stated and that he would never want to be a part of either order, because he believed the Jedi and Sith extinct, and that he was part of something new. Morit's attacks and swings were easily parried by Vader, so he backed off to allow Aiolin a turn at Vader, but she likewise was held at bay. Then, Cylo-V appeared, the next clone body of Cylo, who ordered the twins to cease hostilities.[2]
            Morit holstered his weapon while Vader expressed his confusion to the doctor: the twins were absent of the Force, but he had believed Cylo had been creating Force-sensitive apprentices to replace Vader as the Emperor's chief enforcer. Cylo clarified that the likes of Morit were not apprentices, but replacements, and revealed Morit's other colleagues to the Dark Lord, who activated his lightsaber and stated that what Cylo had created was blasphemy to the Force itself. Cylo, however, entertained that in many ways, the enforcers were Vader's children: they, like Vader, were more machine than man. Vader had heard enough, and prepared to strike Cylo down, but was stopped by Darth Sidious, who had materialized behind him. Therefore, Cylo revealed that he had arranged the demonstration with Morit and Aiolin, and ordered the five enforcers to attack Vader in order to prove they were worthy of serving their Emperor.[2]
            The twins, as one, attacked first. Morit ducked under Vader's swings, and jumped back with Ailoin and unleashed the flamethrowers built-into their hands. The other three enforcers dueled the Dark Lord next, however, all were held at bay by Vader. On the orders of Palpatine, Cylo ordered that the fight be a free-for-all, and to the death. Morit engaged Karbin in lightsaber combat, the Mon Calamari's four-arms that each held a lightsaber in full show. Meanwhile, Vader fought the Trandoshan and began to lose ground to the reptile. Morit rushed over and cut the Trandoshan down before Vader could recover; Morit had believed he had saved Vader's life.[3]
            After Sidious ordered the fighting to cease, he informed Vader that he had only saved him because he saw the "old model" of Jedi and Sith that Vader was a part of was not a threat, he believed the new world of cybernetics and clone that Cylo had created was far superior. Vader was unimpressed: he berated Morit for "interfering" in Vader's business by taking a life that was the Dark Lord's right to take. Sidious then informed the now four enforcers—Vader included—their mission in life: to strike down all who opposed the Empire and Sidious. He told them to remember in the end, only one of the enforcers needed to survive to serve him, he then left and Vader followed, leaving Morit and the others to prepare.[3]
            Some days later, Morit and the other enforcers traveled to the Grand General of the Imperial Military, Cassio Tagge's, Executor-class Star Dreadnaught, the Annihilator, in the Anthan system. Once Vader arrived, too, Tagge briefed Morit and the other enforcers on a criminal organization that had defiantly remained active even during the "Imperial crackdown" of criminal-forces: The Plasma Devils.[7] (The Plasma Devils were in reality a small cell of Rebel Alliance pilots).[8] The Grand General assigned Morit and his sister to take down the Plasma Devils, ignoring Karbin's objections to the twins' inexperience in running a full military campaign. Tagge then assigned the others—Voidgazer, Karbin and Vader—missions of their own, and dismissed the meeting.[7]
            Morit and his twin immediately set out on their mission to destroy the Plasma Devils. They began their search in Anthan Prime's underworld, which was located far beneath the surface of the planet. They brought along a division of Imperial stormtroopers and invaded a criminal-owned barely-legal droid fighting den. They ordered the stormtrooper captain to remain outside with the other soldiers, and entered the establishment. They quickly resorted to violence in order to scare the locals into revealing the location of the Plasma Devil's base; Morit and Aiolin brandished their lightsabers and began systematically killing the den's patrons and gladiator droids, which attacked them.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Morit_Astarte</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMoritAstarte</string></dict>
        <key>Dallan Morvis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.523.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dallan Morvis was the second-in-command aboard the Courageous during the Mandalorian Wars. He fought at the battles at Vanquo, Serroco, and Omonoth and was later promoted to the rank of captain and placed in the command of his own capital ship, Veltraa. Eventually, Morvis reached the rank of admiral and gained the command of Diligence.
            His father was the founder of the Coruscant Financial Exchange and his mother—the senator from Chandrila, so Dallan Morvis has been obviously groomed for big things. But instead of typical thrust into the Naval Academy at Coruscant, Morvis choose to become an asset to the Admiralty.
            Upon graduation, he became a junior liaison between the Vanjervalis design team and Admiral Noma Sommos's staff. That assignment eventually lead him to promotion to lieutenant and his first bridge posting on Reciprocity under command on then-Captain Saul Karath. Morvis saw in Karath a leader on the rise, so he followed him to Courageous—and right into the Mandalorian Wars. But on Courageous, Morvis encountered a rival in the junior officer Carth Onasi. Onasi shared both Karath's hardscrabble beginnings and penchant for quick and sometimes reckless decision-making - neither of which apply to the high-born, calculating Morvis. In Carth, Morvis saw a competitor for the admiral's favor, so he struggled to make life more difficult for him.
            When fugitive Padawan Zayne Carrick was brought onboard and later joined them on the escape from Serroco, Morvis showed no sympathy for Onasi's new friend. But it was Onasi and Carrick, without whom Morvis would never escape a career-ending disaster aboard the Arkanian Legacy. There, Morvis suggested to Karath that the Republic use exogorths—weaponized space slugs capable of decimating star systems—to create a firewall of scorched systems between itself and the Mandalorians and urged him to bargain for Republic control of the slugs. But Onasi and Carrick brought the affair to an unfortunate end, leaving Morvis with empty hands back on Coruscant.
            This time however, Morvis choose to turn to his political connections, which resulted in him not only escaping punishment but also winning a captaincy aboard Karath's successor vessel, the Swiftsure and soon enough—the command of his own capital ship, Veltraa. Morvis, thus, continued to show his talents as a survivor willing to do anything to protect his position—a hidden element of Karath's character he struggled to imitate and cultivate. He eventually became Zayne Carrick's commanding officer during the Mandalorian Wars, and both were captured by the Mandalorians. Eventually Zayne took charge during a prison escape, and the rest of the soldiers began to defer to Zayne. Morvis was enraged and blamed Carrick for everything bad that had happened. Zayne finally had enough and told Morvis that it was his own fault; now that he was in a position where he couldn't rely on favors he didn't know what to do. Morvis finally broke down and admitted that he felt the need to live up to his family's proud legacy. Zayne told him that being a hero means facing danger when the time comes.
            Eventually, Morvis was promoted to the rank of admiral and was given the command of his own Inexpugnable-class ship, the Diligence. He was described millennia later by the mercenary brigadier Jarrow Rusher as a capable yet misunderstood officer. Sith Lord Arkadia Calimondra, however, claimed that his accomplishments were fraudulent.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dallan_Morvis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDallanMorvis</string></dict>

        <key>Morad Sumar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.525.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Morad Sumar was a farmer on Lothal, and an old friend of Ezra Bridger's parents. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, he struggled to keep his land from Imperial hands, refusing to sell it to them. Finally forgoing Sumar's refusal to sell, Supply Master Yogar Lyste destroyed a portion of the farm and had Sumar and his wife Marida arrested. However, Bridger and the Lasan High Honor Guardsman Zeb Orrelios, who had stolen an Imperial TIE fighter, came to their rescue.
            Morad Sumar was a human male who lived on the planet Lothal during the Age of the Empire. In 4 BBY, he owned a farm on the outskirts of Kothal city and was an old friend of the rebel Ezra Bridgers parents. While on a grocery shopping trip, Ezra encountered Morad, who operated a fruit stall in the Kothal market. Morad gave Ezra a jogan fruit but was unable to sell the boy a Meiloorun fruit since the species did not grow on Lothal.[3]
            Shortly later, Morad was visited by the Imperial Supply Master Yogar Lyste, who wanted to buy his farm. However, Sumar refused to sell his land to the Empire. Unwilling to let the matter rest, Lyste revisited the farm with three Imperial Troop Transports and a contingent of stormtroopers. When Morad protested that he was not changing his mind, Lyste smugly responded that the Empire was no longer interested in buying his farm and ordered his men to raze the farm. Morad, his wife Marida Sumar, and their Aqualish helper were then arrested and loaded into the side compartments of a Troop Transport.[3]
            While traveling on the plains of Lothal, the Imperial transports encountered a stolen TIE fighter, that had been stolen by Ezra and his rebel companion Garazeb Orrelios. When the transports opened fire on the TIE fighter, Ezra managed to leap onto the central transport. Using the Force, the young Jedi apprentice managed to free Morad, his wife, and their helper from their restraints. At Ezra's instruction, the trio jumped into the grassy plains and fled. Meanwhile, Ezra stole a crate of meiloorun fruit and escaped with Zeb.[3]
            By 2 BBY, Morad and his wife Marida had joined a rebel cell led by Ryder Azadi, the former Governor of Lothal. By then, Morad had found work as a factory worker at the Imperial Armory Complex, which manufactured vehicles for the Imperial Military. There, he was referred to by the call sign Worker 5473. Under Ryder's direction, Morad sabotaged Imperial vehicles, leading to a high rate of accidents. That year, Morad, his wife, and the Ithorian bartender Jho attended a night meeting at Ryder's stone circle in Lothal's wilderness. The rebels were joined by Ezra Bridger, Kanan Jarrus, and the astromech droid Chopper, members of the Spectres who had since joined the Phoenix Cell, which was part of the galactic-wide rebellion against the Empire.[2]
            Upon seeing Ezra, Morad observed that the boy had grown and told him that his late parents would be proud. Morad and his comrades soon learned that Ezra and his companions were on Lothal to enlist help from another Rebel cell to take out the Imperial factory on Lothal. Morad and his wife cheered upon hearing this news. Ezra also informed Morad and Ryder that their contact Fulcrum had provided them with intelligence that the Empire was building a new type of weapon and that the Phoenix Squadron needed to know what it was before committing any attack. Morad suspected that the tightening of security in the factory's Section A2 was linked to the weapon and agreed to help Ezra and his rebels comrades infiltrate the factory.[2]
            The following day, Morad managed to obtain workers' overalls and hoods for Ezra and Kanan. Chopper was also disguised as an Imperial communication droid. After arriving, Morad and his rebel allies were summoned for an assembly convened by Governor Arihnda Pryce, Agent Kallus, and Lieutenant Yogar Lyste. The factory was visited by Grand Admiral Thrawn, who had been dispatched by Imperial High Command to investigate the high rate of malfunctioning vehicles produced by the Lothal factory. Thrawn gave a speech berating the workers for their poor craftsmanship and then summoned Morad for a test demonstration on a 614-AvA speeder bike.[2]
            When Thrawn asked Morad if he had been pressed into the Empire's service, Sumar confirmed that this was the case after losing his farm. Sumar also professed to take pride in his craftsmanship. Since the speeder bike had been the last vehicle that Morad personally inspected, Thrawn ordered him to demonstrate how quickly it could reach maximum speed. With little choice, Morad got on the speeder and powered up the engine. As he began to accelerate, the speeder slowly began to overheat. Morad recommended they shut it down but Thrawn urged him to keep going and accelerated the stimulator. This caused the overheating engine to explode, destroying the bike and killing Morad.[2]
            Morad's death horrified Ezra, Kanan, the other workers and even Agent Kallus. Having sufficiently intimidated the workers, Thrawn then warned the workers that they would personally test each machine that they built. Thrawn also ordered his subordinates to lock down the factory and question the workers. Not wanting Morad to have died in vain, Ezra and his rebel comrades continued their mission and managed to obtain the blue prints for the Imperial weapon, which turned out to be a TIE Defender. With the help of a disillusioned Kallus, the Spectres managed to escape and escape with Ryder's group into the wilderness. Ezra also informed Marida of her husband's death.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Morad_Sumar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMoradSumar</string></dict>
        <key>Dama Montalvo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.526.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dama Montalvo was a Human male Jedi Padawan that served the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Three months after the war's initiation, Montalvo and his Master, Cei Vookto, fought on behalf of the Republic on the planet Lianna. Although the battle ended in the Republic's favor, Vookto was slain. Montalvo attended Vookto's funeral pyre and came under Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi's command. About three years later, Montalvo was captured by the forces of the newly–established Galactic Empire, led by Emperor Palpatine—the Republic's final Supreme Chancellor—who had declared the Jedi Knights to be traitors. Montalvo was interrogated by the Dark Lord Darth Vader, who hoped to gain information on the whereabouts of the former Jedi Council member Obi-Wan Kenobi. After Montalvo refused to aid the Sith Lord, Vader executed the Jedi.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Dama Montalvo was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. Selected as the Padawan of Jedi Master Cei Vookto, Montalvo constructed his own lightsaber during his studies. When the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Montalvo took up the rank of Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic and joined his master on the front lines.[2]
            During the fighting on Lianna, Vookto was slain and Montalvo was able to survive the battle, which ended in a victory for the Republic while the planet was left devastated. When the fighting ended, Grand Master Yoda and Master of the Order Mace Windu presided over Vookto's funeral as the grieving Montalvo stood by. In order to keep Montalvo involved, the Jedi High Council temporarily assigned Montalvo as the Padawan of Master Ki-Adi-Mundi until a suitable replacement could be found.[2]
            Surviving the rest of the war, Montalvo avoided the initial execution of Contingency Order 66 which called for the death of all Jedi. Fleeing from the clone troopers he once served alongside, Montalvo was captured by the newly-founded Galactic Empire and held in a detention facility deep beneath the Senate Building on Coruscant. Tortured by the Sith Lord Darth Vader tirelessly, Vader attempted to extract the location of Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Padawan. Refusing to reveal any knowledge he may have, Vader snapped Montalvo's neck, an action "less than well done" according to his master Darth Sidious, who had further interrogations planned.[1]
            Comic writer John Ostrander based Dama Montalvo's name after the screen name of a poster on the Dark Horse Comics forums.[source?] Ostrander speculated that Montalvo was born in 37 BBY on Alderaan.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dama_Montalvo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDamaMontalvo</string></dict>

Modon was the son of Drokko Kira and in turn had a son, Oron Kira, who fell in love with Princess Galia, heiress to the throne of Iziz. The two arranged to be married at Fortress Kira, Modon Kira's forest stronghold, and the Beast-Lord attended their binding ceremony. The union was subsequently interrupted by the entrance of three Jedi Knights—brothers Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, and the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta—who had been sent by Galia's mother, Queen Amanoa, to retrieve the princess. Instead, Kira convinced the Jedi to join his side, and they embarked on a peace mission to convince Amanoa to end the war.
            The peace mission failed, however, and Modon Kira was forced to lead his Beast Rider army against Iziz in a climactic battle. Although the Beast Riders took the upper hand, Amanoa turned the tide of the battle by invoking the power of the dark side against Kira's army. The momentum shifted, and Kira's forces were put on the defensive. The Beast Riders regained the advantage, however, when Jedi Master Arca Jeth arrived and employed his skill with battle meditation, which proved to be the deciding factor. After the battle, Modon's son, Oron, and Galia were married under the laws of the Galactic Republic, officially unifying the two warring civilizations of Onderon.
            Modon Kira, the son of Beast Rider Drokko Kira, was a Human male born on the Inner Rim planet of Onderon. Modon's father had been cast out of Onderon's capital, the walled city of Iziz, years before for challenging the dark side regime of Queen Amanoa and the worshipers of an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith named Freedon Nadd. Drokko promptly joined the exiled Beast Riders of Onderon's wilderness who were at war with Iziz's inhabitants. Modon grew to become a proud and ruthless man of formidable physical strength, and in time became a respected and powerful Beast-Lord. He also became a successful commander in the ongoing Beast Wars against the forces of Iziz.[2]
            Modon eventually had a son, Oron Kira, who also became a respected Beast-Lord. As enemies of the Onderon Royal Family, Beast Riders were not allowed to enter the city. Nevertheless, Modon and his family traveled in and out of the city for years, trading secretly with the political underground. It was there that Oron fell in love with Princess Galia, heiress to the Onderonian throne, who returned his affections. The two made plans to marry, although it meant that she would be forced to forsake her crown and royal lineage.[1] In 4000 BBY, Modon's son and a team of Beast Riders staged an attack on the Iziz Royal Palace, where they absconded with Galia.[2]
            Galia was brought to Fortress Kira, Modon forest citadel, where the binding ceremony of the Beast-Lord's son and the Princess of Iziz commenced. Modon, his elderly father, Drokko, and hundreds of Beast Riders attended the festivities. However, the ceremony was interrupted by the arrival of three Jedi Knights—brothers Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, and the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta—who had been sent by Galia's mother, Amanoa, to retrieve the princess. The Jedi swept into the fortress riding boma beasts and grabbed Galia, although they quickly unhanded her when she revealed that she was willingly marrying Oron.[1]
            Modon, having previously been informed of the Jedi's approach, welcomed them and invited them to join the festivities. Oron informed the Jedi that the Onderonian monarchy was under the sway of the dark side, and Modon revealed that he had gathered the Beast Rider forces to launch one final assault on Iziz. The Beast-Lord asked the Jedi to join the attack, although Ulic Qel-Droma still wanted to attempt to peacefully resolve the conflict. The Beast Riders and the Jedi reached an agreement: the Jedi, along with Galia and Oron, would go to the Iziz Royal Palace and try to convince Amanoa to end the war, and Modon's army of Beast Riders would attack Iziz if they failed.[1]
            Modon's Beast Rider army trailed behind on their winged warbeasts while the Jedi, Oron, and Galia flew to the Iziz Royal Palace in the Nebulon Ranger starship. Modon believed in his heart that the peace mission would fail, and he appeared to be correct as the defense guns on the city walls targeted the Beast Riders on sight. In the royal palace, Amanoa rejected the plea for peace and gave herself over to the dark side, initiating battle in the throne room. Waiting outside of Iziz, Modon received a communication from Galia that the peace mission had failed.[1]
            With war the only option, Kira rallied his Beast Rider army and laid siege to Iziz. Kira's Beast Riders pushed Amanoa's army back to the walls of the Royal Palace, forcing Amanoa to withdraw to the tomb of Amanoa's Sith Master, the deceased Dark Lord Freedon Nadd. There, Amanoa called the dark side down upon the Beast Riders. The Beast Riders' progress was halted by the pall of the dark side, and despite the tide being turned, Kira ordered his army to fight on. Their warbeasts had grown out of control, and the ground soldiers felt sick and confused.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Modon_Kira</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascModonKira</string></dict>
        <key>Rom Mohc</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.531.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>General Rom Mohc was a Human male who was a hero of the Clone Wars, serving in the armies of the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire. Having developed an obsession with cybernetics and personal combat during the Clone Wars, Mohc was the architect of the Dark Trooper Project that arose in the wake of the destruction of the first Death Star. Despite initial successes in field testing, the project was destroyed by Rebel Alliance agent Kyle Katarn, who defeated Mohc in single combat.
            A non-clone officer of the Grand Army of the Republic, Rom Mohc fought in the Clone Wars with a passion for personal combat under the command of General Locus Geen. Mohc gained a reputation for fighting battle droids in hand-to-hand combat and developed a keen understanding of cybernetics. His ability to ascertain the weaknesses of various droid designs proved invaluable at the Invasion of Coruscant by the droid army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Mohc also had a healthy respect for the clone troopers and relished working with them.
            Mohc's bravery during the Clone Wars and loyalty put him on the fast track to success in Palpatine's New Order. On many worlds, Mohc fought in Palpatine's name, earning three Imperial Medals of Valor and the Distinguished Medal of Imperial Honor. Mohc continued his fascination with droids, often pitting himself against various deadly droids. His eccentric taste for combat culminated in a trophy room of battle droids that he had defeated, including a prototype IG-97, a ZQ infantry droid, and several Mark IX-XI Executioners. Mohc's passion for personal combat became almost obsessive, and he came to insist that every soldier had the right to face the enemy man-to-man, to the point of protesting the Death Star project.[5][6]
            As a Zero-G assault stormtrooper, Mohc grew frustrated with the limitations of Imperial cybernetics. Mohc believed that with his experience fighting droids and knowledge of their weaknesses, he could develop an ultimate battle droid, and "studied the designs of mechanical soldiers throughout history, from Xim to the Sith to the Iron Knights of the Old Republic."[7]
            Mohc's research yielded the initial designs for what would become the dark trooper. Allying with Baron Orman Tagge, Mohc designed the Z-X3 experimental droid trooper, designed to supplement stormtroopers in dangerous radiation or vacuum. An experimental batch of seventy droids proved deadly and adaptable, but the Imperial Military viewed the use of battle droids with distaste and the Z-X3 was rejected.[5]
            Mohc refused to admit defeat and kept pushing his ideas. His perseverance finally paid off when he won support from the Imperial Department of Military Research, and in 17 BBY young Lieutenant Mohc was stationed aboard the Empirical, a hidden space station in the Dominus sector, to oversee the Phase Zero Dark Trooper project, an attempt to restore aging clone troopers to battle-worthiness by remaking them into cyborgs. However, as the subjects were forcibly recruited into the project, many Phase Zero Dark Troopers could not cope with the state of being more machine than man and attempted suicide. The project was eventually shut down as the Empire grew in power and the recruitment rate of non-clones rose, though the successful subjects of the project became the Purge Troopers, which would later inspire the design of the Phase III dark trooper.[5]
            Having been a prominent figure during the Empire's rise to power, Mohc was eventually promoted to the rank of general.[2] During the year 1 BBY,[8] General Mohc worked as an administrator at the Imperial Academy of the planet Carida.[9] During his term, Mohc installed a high-tech surveillance system meant to act as a deterrent for misbehavior among cadets.[10] Even so, General Mohc was well-respected by the academy's students due to his status as a combat veteran and not just another officer. Mohc was particularly impressed with cadet Kyle Katarn, who acted with bravery on his Omega Exercise, which involved the taking of asteroid AX-456 from the forces of the Rebel Alliance. To honor the the cadet's bravery, Mohc personally commended Katarn at the latter's bedside. Later that same day, Mohc hosted dinner for the Imperial Inquisitor Jerec,[9] who—while using Mohc's surveillance system to spy on Katarn—expressed an interest in meeting Katarn.[10] Ironically, Jerec had executed Katarn's father sometime earlier for being an Alliance militant.[9]
            Mohc later addressed the year's graduating class, where he was given the cadets' full attention. After the speech's conclusion, General Mohc and Jerec presented awards to the students who graduated in the top ten percent of the class, which included presenting Katarn with the Imperial Medal of Honor.[9] Special awards of valor and merit were also distributed to cadets Rand Nalleck, Dana Cory, Chad Longko, and Ben. However, as the ceremony progressed, Mohc wished for it to end so he could entertain a mistress.[10]
            Despite the Imperials' praise for Katarn, the cadet abandoned the Empire upon realizing that he had been lied too about the circumstances of his father's death, having been told rebel insurgents killed his father rather than being executed by an Imperial official. Katarn joined the Rebel Alliance and quickly partook in a mission where he stole information regarding the Death Star project that helped the Alliance destroy the battle station[9] during the year 0 BBY.[11] Ironically, General Mohc had previously opposed the construction of the Death Star due to his distrusting nature of technology that separated soldiers from battlefield glory.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rom_Mohc</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRomMohc</string></dict>
        <key>Berun Modrul</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.532.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Berun Modrul was a member of the Khoonda Militia 3951 BBY, second in command to Zherron. He was an opinionated young male Human who often suspected he knew better than Zherron what was best and had wanted to try to compromise with Azkul and the mercenaries. When Meetra Surik asked him what he thought of the Jedi, he was one of the few who didn't have a problem with her mentioning that they tried to help the settlers wherever they could and even solving a murder. He later fought in the Battle of Khoonda and realized that Zherron had been right about the mercenaries all along. It is unknown whether he later joined Zherron and the Khoonda Militia in the Battle of Telos IV or if he stayed on Dantooine.
            In the game, the player has the option to turn Berun into the new captain and Zherron into his subordinate by revealing to Administrator Adare that Zherron is endangering Khoonda by spying upon the mercenaries. This decision awards the player neither dark nor light side points, and thus its canonicity is unknown, although this is mutually exclusive with a quest that the exile should recover atmospheric sensors for one of the militia members, Saedhe. If the player discover the hidden cameras on the sensors, question the militia member about it and decides to return it at the original price, the player is awarded light side points.
            Even if the player does make Berun the new Militia captain, Zherron is immediately reinstated as the militia has knowledge of Azkul's attack on Khoonda.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Berun_Modrul</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBerunModrul</string></dict>
        <key>Dopheld Mitaka</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.533.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dopheld Mitaka was a human male officer who served the First Order as a lieutenant on board the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer, the flagship of the Force-user Kylo Ren. He took part in an operation above the planet Jakku to prevent the Resistance from obtaining information about the location of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker.
            Dopheld Mitaka was a human male who was a member of the First Order. He graduated at the top of his Academy class and earned a prestigious placement aboard the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Finalizer about thirty years after the Battle of Endor.[3] Mitaka took part in an operation to capture a BB-series astromech droid called BB-8, who was carrying the fragment of a map containing the location of the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. After BB-8 escaped Jakku with the former stormtrooper FN-2187 and the scavenger Rey aboard the Millennium Falcon, Mitaka informed Kylo Ren about FN-2187's role in the droid's escape.[4]
            In a fit of rage, Kylo Ren destroyed a nearby computer terminal with his lightsaber, with Mitaka bracing himself beforehand, initially thinking Ren was going to lash out at him. When he had calmed down enough to inquire if there was anything else in the report, Mitaka then informed him about Rey's involvement. Ren then used the Force to pull Mitaka towards him and grabbed him around the neck. He then demanded to know more information about the girl.[4]
            Mitaka first appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015. Mitaka was portrayed by actor Sebastian Armesto. He was not identified in the film, but received a name in the reference book Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction to the film.

        <key>Ruescott Melshi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.534.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ruescott Melshi was a human male sergeant in the Alliance to Restore the Republic Special Forces during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. A close friend of Alliance Intelligence Captain Cassian Andor, Melshi was a veteran soldier and a respected commander, leading his troops by personal example. In 0 BBY, when the Alliance learned about the existence of the Empire's Death Star superweapon, Melshi led a rebel extraction team during the rescue of Jyn Erso—daughter of Galen Erso, the Death Star project's chief engineer—from a labor camp on the planet Wobani.
            After Erso's liberation, the Alliance employed her to make contact with her father, discovering that he had deliberately left a crucial weakness in the Death Star's design as an act of sabotage. In an effort to retrieve the Death Star's schematics needed to pinpoint that weak spot, Melshi helped Andor assemble a ragtag group of volunteers dubbed "Rogue One." The squad then set off on a mission to the Imperial security complex on the planet Scarif, where the plans were being stored. During the subsequent battle on the planet, Melshi and the rest of Rogue One successfully obtained the Death Star plans, but they all gave their lives to ensure the mission's success.
            Ruescott Melshi was a human male member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the early days of rebellion against the Galactic Empire. An experienced soldier and infiltrator, Melshi served as a sergeant in[5] the Pathfinders branch[3] of the Alliance Special Forces. During his time with the rebels, Melshi became a good friend of Captain Cassian Andor, a member of Alliance Intelligence.[5] As an infiltrator, Melshi often had to perform dirty work in the name of the Rebellion.[2]
            At one point, Melshi served together with Lieutenant Caluan Ematt on Gaulus. Sharing his expertise with other members of the Rebellion, Melshi also made additions to a rebel field manual, writing a section on various Imperial stormtrooper variants and describing the distinctive features of each of those branches.[6] By 0 BBY,[1] Melshi was a member of the Massassi Group, the largest rebel cell operating from the Great Temple on the fourth moon of the planet Yavin.[2] By that point, the sergeant was considered one of the Alliance's seasoned veterans.[4]
            In 0 BBY,[1] Andor received intelligence that the Empire was building a superweapon with enough firepower to destroy a planet. The Alliance, in an attempt to make contact with the weapon's leading engineer, Galen Erso, decided to locate his daughter, Jyn. The rebels uncovered recent arrest files on Erso indicating that she was being held inside Imperial Detention Center &amp; Labor Camp LEG-817 on the planet Wobani under the alias "Liana Hallik." Having verified that information, General Davits Draven approved the formation of Extraction Team Bravo, a rapid-response team of marines led by Melshi.[4] The team included two other rebel troopers as well as K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial KX-series security droid,[2] which was recommended to Melshi by Andor.[6]
            Following a rescue plan personally devised by Melshi,[6] the extraction team used a U-wing starfighter designated Bravo One to reach Wobani,[7] timing their arrival to coincide with the moment when Erso was being transported on a workers' convoy.[4] Evading Imperial sensors, the team landed on the planet and proceeded undercover to a halfway point between the prison and the convoy's destination.[6] With great risk to themselves,[4] the team overtook and boarded one of the Empire's HCVw A9 turbo tanks that held the captive Erso. Melshi and his men took out two stormtrooper guards, after which the sergeant unlocked Erso's stuncuffs, informing her that she was being rescued. However, when another prisoner asked Melshi to unbind him, Erso took advantage of the distraction, punching Melshi in the face and grabbing a nearby shovel. Erso knocked out Melshi and his companions with the shovel before rushing from the tank, only to be intercepted by K-2SO outside.[2]
            With Erso taken into custody,[4] Melshi and the extraction team returned to Bravo One and left the planet. However, the team experienced a technical malfunction with the U-wing's navigation computer, rendering them unable to make the jump to hyperspace and forcing them to take refuge inside an asteroid field in the Wobani system. The situation necessitated K-2SO to call for assistance from the Alliance Fleet, which quickly responded by sending Red Flight, a group of four T-65B X-wing starfighters, to assist Melshi's team and provide escort until the rebel CR90 corvette Vigilant arrived to pick up the team. However, as soon as the Vigilant arrived in the system, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer emerged from hyperspace, destroying the corvette and catching Bravo One with a tractor beam. While Red Flight fought off the Star Destroyer's complement of TIE fighters, K-2SO was able to repair their craft's navigation computer. Red Flight then destroyed the Star Destroyer's targeting array, momentarily disabling the tractor beam and allowing Melshi's team to make the jump to hyperspace.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ruescott_Melshi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRuescottMelshi</string></dict>

        <key>Tal Merrik</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.537.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Prince Tal Merrik was a human male who represented his homeworld of Kalevala in the Galactic Senate during the Clone Wars, and served as a member of the Council of Neutral Systems. Merrik secretly worked alongside Death Watch, a group of Mandalorians who disagreed with the pacifist ways of the New Mandalorians, and sought to usurp Duchess Satine Kryze. Merrik's attempt on Kryze's life brought him into contact with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, the latter of whom killed Merrik aboard the Coronet.
            A male human,[3] Tal Merrik served his homeworld of Kalevala,[1] a planet in the Mandalore system,[4] in the Galactic Republic's Senate.[3] However, in secret, Merrik was working with the Mandalorian terrorist organization known as Death Watch, and due to this, also the Confederacy of Independent Systems.[2]
            Merrik was seen walking alongside Satine Kryze on Mandalore in the Sundari Royal Palace, during the time she greeted Obi-Wan Kenobi, an emissary from the Jedi High Council who was investigating rumors of Mandalorian involvement with the Separatists. He was also noticeably surprised when Kryze retorted against Kenobi, whose government accused her of treason against the Republic. Merrik attempted to speak to Kenobi and Prime Minister Almec before Kryze interrupted him and engaged in a battle of words with Kenobi. Kenobi revealed his mission was assigned by the Jedi Council, silencing Kryze who had believed him to be on assignment from the Republic. Kryze and Kenobi then departed on a walk through the domed capital city of Mandalore, Sundari.[3]
            Merrik later was present on the Coronet, a luxury starship used to take members of the Council of Neutral Systems to the galactic capital world Coruscant. Kenobi, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and several clone troopers were also present aboard as protection against a Death Watch threat. Merrik questioned the Duchess on how the Council would oppose the Clone Wars. Kenobi entered the room and entered a follow-up debate with Kryze on the merits of Jedi involvement in the war, before being interrupted by Orn Free Taa. Merrik and Taa agreed that both Kryze and Kenobi proved there were two sides to every dilemma.[2]
            Later, Kenobi and Kryze continued their debate, to which Merrik interrupted once more, stating that they should all use rest and refreshments. Kryze then promptly left the room, as the others, including Kin Robb and Onaconda Farr, observed in silence.[2]
            Farr, Kryze, Robb, Merrik and Taa shared dinner, which included deep-fried nuna leg, aboard the Coronet. Kenobi entered the room and announced to the senators that the clones were investigating a disturbance below decks. Merrik observed as Kenobi received a call on his comlink that entailed a container had been opened and emptied. Inside of the container were assassin probes, one of which was dispatched in the lower levels while a second had escaped up the elevator. The second assassin probe arrived at the dinner service quickly and prepared to attack the senators before Kenobi quickly dispatched it.[2]
            However, the assassin probes spouted smaller probe killers that swarmed the room, to which Kenobi used his lightsaber to destroy many, whilst Kryze utilized her blaster pistol to deactivate them. After somewhat returning to dinner service, Kenobi arrived with one of the probe killers in a container. Kenobi used the probe to see which senator it would not attack, hence revealing the traitor. When Kenobi realized that Merrik was the treasonous one, Merrik quickly retaliated and took Kryze hostage.[2]
            Merrik held a blaster to Kryze's head and took the Duchess from the dinner room, arriving at the helm of the ship where he quickly dispatched all of the pilots and contacted Pre Vizsla. Death Watch informed him that reinforcements were on there way, just as three Droch-class boarding ships carrying B2 super battle droids arrived on the Coronet. Merrik, who had secretly wired the starship's engines to explode at the press of the button, threatened Kenobi as a gunfight ensued across the ship.[2]
            Kryze expressed her love for Kenobi much to Merrik's chagrin, before she expressed that Merrik was a slug, stepping on his foot and taking his blaster. Merrik expressed that neither of them would kill him; as Kryze would be branded a hypocrite to all of her pacifist ideals and Kenobi would be seen as a hero to everyone but the Duchess. Instead, neither of them killed him; it was Anakin Skywalker who had snuck up behind the unsuspecting senator and killed him with a lightsaber through the chest.[2] Merrik's dreams of Mandalore switching sides would eventually be fulfilled when Death Watch conquered Mandalore several years later.[5]
            Tal Merrik first appeared in "The Mandalore Plot," the twelfth episode of Star Wars: The Clone Wars' second season. His identity was confirmed in the credits. He was voiced by Greg Proops, who voiced Fode in The Phantom Menace.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tal_Merrik</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTalMerrik</string></dict>

        <key>Jaster Mereel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.539.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jaster Mereel was a male Human born on the Outer Rim world of Concord Dawn. Mereel served as a Journeyman Protector, one of the planet's respected lawkeepers, until the day when his strong morals led him to kill a corrupt superior officer. Charged with murder, Mereel was exiled from Concord Dawn, going on to join the Mandalorians. An accomplished soldier, Mereel's prowess in battle earned him the respect of his supercommando peers, and he would eventually go on to become Mand'alor, the leader of all the Mandalorian clans, and the Al'Ori'Ramikade—"Commander of Supercommandos". As Mand'alor, Mereel issued a new guideline for Mandalorian behavior known as the Supercommando Codex in which he asserted that the Mandalorians who wished to fight would simply be highly-paid soldiers, and should conduct themselves as honorable mercenaries.
            Mereel would face opposition to his reforms both from the peaceful New Mandalorian faction, and the more dangerous Death Watch, a violent splinter group formed by the followers of Mereel's rival, Tor Vizsla. A civil war broke out between the Death Watch and the supercommandos loyal to Mereel, the early years of which would see Mereel's return to his home planet, where he saved the life of a local farmer's son, Jango Fett, when the Death Watch attacked the boy's home. Taking Fett in following the death of his family, Mereel raised the boy as a his son until the fateful Battle of Korda Six. Ambushed by the Death Watch and betrayed by his second-in-command, Montross, Mereel was killed by Vizsla. His body was carried back to the Mandalorians' landing zone by Fett, where Montross was exposed as a traitor and Fett succeeded his adoptive father as the new Mand'alor, in accordance with what Mereel would have wanted.
            Jaster Mereel was a male Human, born on the agricultural world of Concord Dawn in the Outer Rim's Mandalore sector. As an adult, Mereel served as a Journeyman Protector—one of his homeworld's respected lawkeepers—until he was driven by his strong moral code to kill a corrupt superior officer. Mereel was subsequently charged with murder, and exiled from Concord Dawn. At some point after, Mereel joined the Mandalorians; an accomplished soldier, Mereel's martial prowess earned him the respect of his peers.[2] Around 60 BBY, Mereel had attained the rank of Mand'alor, the traditional leader of the Mandalorian clans.[3] Having noticed many Mandalorians' dissatisfaction with the wide-spread savagery that had become prevalent in certain warrior circles, Mereel hoped to hold the Mandalorians to a higher standard of behavior. As Mand'alor, Mereel instituted the Supercommando Codex, a new behavioral guideline influenced by Mereel's own moral ideals, in which Mereel decreed that any Mandalorians who wished to fight would be merely highly-paid soldiers, and should conduct themselves as honorable mercenaries.[2] It was around this time that Mereel would have some manner of dealings with the Regent of Mek va Uil, acting as both Mand'alor and Al'Ori'Ramikade—"Commander of Supercommandos". During this interaction, Mereel informed the regent of his views on what it meant to be a mercenary, and why they were deserving of respect.[4]
            However, Mereel's ideas were not unanimously accepted throughout the Mandalorian community. By this point in time, a large number of Mandalorians had joined the peaceful movement of the New Mandalorians, a reformist political faction formed in the aftermath of a devastating conflict with the Galactic Republic approximately 670 years earlier. The New Mandalorians had moved away from the traditional warrior ways, denouncing the old warrior codes, and believed that the best opportunity for Mandalorian survival and prosperity would come through being peaceful, neutral, and tolerant.[5] Further dissension came in the form of a number of a amoral Mandalorians who resented Mereel for his attempts to rein in their enjoyed lifestyles of unaccountability. These malcontents rallied to a Mandalorian soldier named Tor Vizsla, and therein formed a splinter group known as the Death Watch with Vizsla as their leader, under the pretense of returning the Mandalorians to their ancient roots as conquerors and raiders with the goal of instigating another war of conquest.[2] Though the Death Watch's goals were quite opposite to the New Mandalorians', they could neither support Mereel's faction of loyal supercommandos—now calling themselves the "True Mandalorians"—for despite his reforms, any act of Mandalorian violence was fundamentally against what the New Mandalorians stood for.[6] Mereel was pressured by Mandalorian hard-liners such as Montross to destroy the Death Watch,[7] and civil war soon broke out between Mereel's True Mandalorians and the Death Watch. The New Mandalorians kept to their ideals of pacifism and non-violence, rejecting both groups[5] and remaining out of the conflict that would come to be known as the Mandalorian Civil War.[2]
            In the year 58 BBY, Mereel returned to his homeworld as the Mandalorian Civil War spilled onto Concord Dawn. Hunted by the Death Watch after a lost firefight, Mereel and his men were forced to rely on the kindness of the Journeyman Protector who'd replaced Mereel, a man by the name of Fett. He offered them refuge on his family's farm, and brought them food in the fields. Unfortunately, the Death Watch captured Fett's young son, Jango, and attempted to use the boy, in addition to a brutal beating, to force the Journeyman Protector to reveal the location of Mereel and his True Mandalorians. Fett would not give in and a chaotic firefight erupted when Fett's wife attempted to save her husband and son. Sadly, both Fett and his wife were killed, although Mereel was able to step in—giving up his cover—in order to save young Jango's life. As the Death Watch set fire to the field Mereel and his troops had fled into, Jango led them to an irrigation pipe that would take them safely away from the blaze.[1] Mereel regrouped his forces in a nearby town and laid in wait until the Death Watch arrived, at which time he sprung an ambush. With the Mandalorians firing on the Death Watch troops, Jango placed an explosive charge on the underside of the armored speeder Vizsla rode into the town upon. The tank exploded, although Vizsla would manage to escape. As the battle came to a close, Mereel located Jango standing over the body of the Death Watch soldier who'd murdered his parents. Praising the boy's courage, Mereel decided to take Jango with him as the Mandalorians departed Concord Dawn, and he eventually came to consider the boy his son.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jaster_Mereel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJasterMereel</string></dict>

        <key>Mekel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.543.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mekel was a male human who was a prospective student of the Sith Academy on Korriban during the waning years of the Jedi Civil War.
            In 3956 BBY, Mekel was met by Revan, a former Sith Lord now a retrained Jedi Padawan, outside the gates of the Academy tormenting a number of sentients wishing to be admitted. Mekel promised to admit whichever person was able to stand in one place the longest without food, water or sleep. Revan was disgusted by this display of cruelty and spoke his mind to the brash Mekel, who only left with a huff and a half-hearted threat.
            After Mekel left, Revan convinced the surviving hopefuls to abandon their quest to join the Sith (some by convincing them of the truth and others by lying and claiming they did not make the cut).
            Revan would later meet Mekel again in the tomb of Tulak Hord in the Valley of the Dark Lords. A former headmaster of the Academy, Jorak Uln, had been driven out by his apprentice, Uthar Wynn, and became a demented hermit holed up in the tomb, kidnapping any Sith students who happened upon him. Wishing to gain prestige to further infiltrate the Academy, Revan sought out Uln and discovered he had captured Mekel. Revan refused to give in to Jorak's game and allowed himself to be tortured in Mekel's place. Mekel was shocked that someone would sacrifice himself for him and used the Force to free Revan and help him kill Jorak. Mekel was grateful to Revan for saving his life, and deduced that he was not a true Sith, but assured Revan that he would not expose him. Mekel expressed remorse over his wrong doings and decided to leave the Sith Academy.
            Though Mekel left the dark side, nothing is known of his ultimate fate; however, statements he made to Revan after being saved seemed to indicate that he would probably not join the Jedi Order.
            Although Mekel's full arsenal of Force powers is not known, he demonstrated his ability with the dark side power Force drain when he and Revan fought Jorak.
            If the player chooses the dark side path for this scenario, he can allow Jorak to torture Mekel to death, or he can turn on Mekel after the two defeat Jorak.
            Two alignment-neutral possibilities exist as well: If Revan does not kill Jorak quickly enough, Mekel may simply fall in combat, resulting in no alignment shift. If the player does not persuade Mekel to abandon the dark side after defeating Jorak, he will simply stay on at the Academy. When the player returns from Naga Sadow's tomb, depending on which choice he made, Mekel may join in with the rest of the Academy in attacking him and end up being killed.
            Similarly, there are alignment-changing possibilities with Mekel's "hopefuls": Dark side points can be rewarded if Revan persuades the Aqualish hopeful that his final task is to kill the guard at the gate. The Aqualish charges the guard, and is quickly killed. Depending on which party members are present, the player will get different responses. Jolee will wonder aloud if all Sith are that gullible when they join the order. Juhani will criticize such cruel, manipulative behavior. Conversely, Zaalbar and HK-47 will be amused, with Zaalbar remarking that he feels no pity whatsoever for the dead Aqualish, and HK praising such skillful "eliminating of the opposition."
            Mekel was voiced by Robin Atkin Downes.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mekel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMekel</string></dict>

Born on the farming planet of Durkteel in 20 ABY, Banz grew up as an orphan, residing under the care of a Phirmist temple, where he heard tales of the Rebellion that overthrew the Galactic Empire. During this time, he developed a heroic personality, dreaming of becoming like Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, or Admiral Gial Ackbar, and he often helped younger orphans in need.[1]
            In 34 ABY, Banz's actions were noticed by Resistance recruiter Antha Mont, and the orphan joined the Resistance, training to become a pilot in a group of cadets known as J-Squadron. A month after arriving at the Resistance base on D'Qar, Banz and a few other members of J-Squadron caused an accident which could have resulted in the deaths of several starfighter pilots. As a punishment, Admiral Ackbar sent them on a scavenging mission to Vodran.

        <key>Kosh</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.547.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kosh was a human male from Tatooine who served as an Imperial captain during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Kosh was stationed on his homeworld as the commander of the 68th Legion of the Stormtrooper Corps garrisoned there created a private smuggling operation, overseeing the conflict against Jennica Pierce's local Rebel Alliance cell.[2]
            At some point, a Rebel agent serving under Pierce managed to destroy Fort Sunfire, one of the main Imperial garrisons on Tatooine. In retaliation, Kosh attacked the agent's own base with an armored cavalry contingent comprising nine All Terrain Scout Transports, one Elite AT-AT, and two 2-M Hover Tanks. The Rebels, however, survived Kosh's mechanized assault. As a result, the Imperial captain decided to attack again, sending half the 68th Legion to the Rebel base, but that second assault failed as well. With the full brunt of his troops defeated, Kosh was forced to be on the defensive. Although he knew the location of the Rebel base, he simply could not attack it anymore. Those events effectively started a contained conflict between Kosh and the local Rebels.[3]
            Some time later, Kosh was made a prefect. However, in the months that followed the Empire's major defeat at Endor, he was captured by a team of Imperial hunters led by pilot Norra Wexley. Kosh became a prisoner of the New Republic, the democratic government established by the Rebels.[4]
            A light-skinned man with a straight nose and blue eyes, Kosh would often pull a contemptuous expression. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, his once-black hair had become gray.[2] To achieve the goals of the Empire, Kosh manipulated both his allies and enemies as pawns. He also had an unusual interest in ancient artifacts.[5]
            Kosh wore the standard uniform of the Imperial Military, which consisted of a double-breasted tunic with matching trousers, black leather belt, black boots, and a hat. On the left side of the upper chest, he sported the insignia of an army captain, featuring three red tiles over three blue ones. Although Kosh did not have any code cylinders, his cap and belt were equipped with an identity disc.[2]
            Kosh is the character who assigns missions in Star Wars: Commander if the player chooses to align with the Empire. If the player chooses the Rebellion, they deal with Jennica Pierce.[2]
            While Star Wars: Commander is his first canon appearance, Kosh originally appeared in the now-Legends book Heroes in Hiding.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kosh</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKosh</string></dict>
        <key>Shen Matale</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.548.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Shen Matale was a Human male living on Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War. The son of Ahlan Matale, he was the heir to his estate.
            Shen had been taught by his father to hate the Sandral family. But one day, he met Rahasia Sandral away from both his and her fathers, and he fell in love with her despite the feud between their families. He also became friends with Rahasia's brother Casus Sandral. But soon after, Casus was killed by kath hounds while exploring the ruins near the Jedi Enclave. When Nurik Sandral wrongly assumed that Casus had been kidnapped by Ahlan, Nurik kidnapped Shen and held him prisoner inside his own heavily-defended mansion. Rahasia pleaded with her father to release the man she loved, but he refused.
            Eventually, an amnesiac Revan came to the Sandral estate to find Shen, and Rahasia told him what was going on. Revan found Shen, but Shen refused to leave without Rahasia because he knew Rahasia would be blamed for his escape and have to endure Nurik's wrath.
            Revan convinced Rahasia to leave with them. During the escape both of them thanked Revan profusely, but then Ahlan showed up with a pair of battle droid bodyguards. When Nurik, flanked by droid guards of his own emerged to confront his old rival, Revan was forced to mediate the feud lest the whole thing end in a firefight. Though both men proved stubborn, Revan managed to persuade the two fathers to see that their children were indeed in love and agreed to build a new house for them. As the two families parted, Shen told Revan that they would always remember him. Shen asked Rahasia to marry him shortly after Revan left.
            It is known that the Matales were "removed" from Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War, so it is likely Shen was killed when the Sith invaded the planet.
            It is possible for the player to convince Shen and Rahasia to run away to the Jedi Enclave. Shen and Rahasia plan to give their fathers a chance to forgive them and welcome them back. If they don't they plan to build a future somewhere else. If this happens, then Shen likely dies during the destruction of the Enclave.
            If the player follows the dark side, he/she can lie to Nurik to make him think that Ahlan killed Casus. If this happens, Shen is killed by Nurik.
            The player can also convince Shen to return to his father by telling him that his relationship with Rahasia will not work or by manipulating him into hating Rahasia, leaving her heartbroken.
            According to Kaevee, Shen was killed and his estate was burned when the Sith Empire invaded Dantooine. Since this was ultimately cut from the final game, however, this is considered non-canon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shen_Matale</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascShenMatale</string></dict>

        <key>Master Codebreaker</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.550.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The Master Codebreaker was a human male codebreaker who was sought out by Rose Tico and Finn on a mission to stop the First Order's flagship, the Supremacy, from tracking the Resistance through hyperspace.[1]
            Master Codebreaker was somewhat known by Maz Kanata, who sent the pair after him while they were desperate for someone of his talents. When they finally spotted him in the Canto Casino in Canto Bight, they attempted to run up to him, but were apprehended by the Canto Bight Police Department for illegally parking their starship on the beach. Master Codebreaker's companion, "Lovey," asked him about the disturbance, and he responded that he thought it was of little consequence.[1]
            Master Codebreaker was only known by his title, and kept his original identity a secret. However, he once posted all of his personal information to a public node, encrypted by biohexacrypt, and anybody who uncovered the information was welcome to take his mantle. However, nobody was known to have retrieved the information.[2]
            At the Canto Casino, Master Codebreaker was only allowed to play dice games, and he was forbidden from electronic entertainment.[2]
            Matching his levels of secrecy, the Codebreaker's companion kept her real name hidden from him, and he only referred to her as "Lovey".[2]
            He regularly wore a brooch in the shape of a red flower, a plom bloom, pinned on his lapel, which Maz told Finn and Rose about as an identifying mark. On the day he was sought out by the pair, he was sporting a thin black mustache.[1]
            Master Codebreaker is a character created by Rian Johnson for the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi. He was portrayed by Justin Theroux. Prior to Theroux's casting, the Master Codebreaker was originally conceived as a giant insect warlord which was supposed to be an animatronic according to creature and droid effects supervisor Neal Scanlan, but the idea was scrapped when Theroux was cast one day before filming.[3]
            In earlier versions of the film's script, Finn and Rose met the Master Codebreaker inside a cabaret room of the Canto Casino, only to be taken in a quest for a stashed knapsack and arrested by the Canto Bight Police Department at the casino's rooftop—following their attempt to break into the Master Codebreaker's room to be discovered by a droid.[3] Jason Fry, the author of film's novelization, originally wanted (along with Johnson) to include this alternate meeting between the Codebreaker, Finn and Rose to shake up the fans' expectations, but ultimately it was decided that presenting an alternate version of a major scene would shake up expectations too much, so the idea was dropped.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Master_Codebreaker</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMasterCodebreaker</string></dict>
        <key>Roth-Del Masona</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.551.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Roth-Del Masona was a male Human Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, the last galactic conflict of the Republic Classic era. During the war, Masona was appointed the adjutant of former Master of the Order, Jedi Master Mace Windu.
            Discovered during his earliest days to be Force-sensitive, Roth-Del Masona was taken to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. A student of the Temple's academy, Masona was eventually taken as a Padawan after passing his last academy tests. After years of on-on-one study with a Jedi Master and crafting a blue-bladed lightsaber, Masona passed the Trials of Knighthood and was made a Jedi Knight by the Jedi High Council.[3]
            At the height of the Separatist Crisis that had erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Masona was stationed on Coruscant when Master Mace Windu assembled a task force meant to rescue captured Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was sentenced to death by execution by the Confederacy's leaders, along with Senator Padmé Amidala and Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Arriving on the dusty world of Geonosis, Masona and his fellow Jedi stormed the Petranaki arena and rescued their fellow Jedi, though many others were killed in the process. When the Separatist Droid Army had the survivors surrounded and Confederacy leader Count Dooku ordered that the droids open fire on the survivors, Grand Master Yoda arrived with the Grand Army of the Republic and evacuated the remaining Jedi. Boarding a Republic gunship and flying out onto the plains of the world, Masona led a group of clone troopers in the first battle of the Clone Wars.[3]
            Returning to the Temple on Coruscant, Masona accepted the rank of General within the Grand Army and also the position of adjutant of Master Windu himself. Fighting bravely in the three years of war, Jedi Masona was stationed on Coruscant when General Grievous, leader of the Separatist fleet, emerged from hyperspace in the skies of Galactic City. Along with Jedi Roron Corobb, Foul Moudama, and B'ink Utrila, Masona was assigned to reinforce Master Shaak Ti and Stass Allie in locating and protecting the Supreme Chancellor. As the Republic war machine fought to protect the capital planet, Masona and his team were rushing Chancellor Palpatine into a bunker deep in the crust of Coruscant. As Master Shaak Ti fought to defend the doors to the bunker, Grievous slipped past unnoticed and engaged the four Jedi protecting Palpatine in a lightsaber duel. Grievous dueled them briefly, and, despite Masona being a renowned duelist, famous for his mastery of Ataru, Grievous was able to decapitate Masona, becoming the first casualty in the fight. Masona's comrade, Jedi Roron Corobb accidentally kicked Masona's head across the room during the fight, causing the Jedi to become distracted enough for Grievous to kill him and the remaining two defenders.[1]
            Roth-Del Masona was portrayed by Leonard Thomas in Attack of the Clones, with "Masona" a tuckerization of Thomas' name.
            While unnamed in Labyrinth of Evil, the Jedi defending the Supreme Chancellor was reconnected to be Masona by his mention in Unknown Soldier: The Story of General Grievous. His appearance in Labyrinth of Evil contradicts the same events as they were portrayed in the television series Star Wars: Clone Wars.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Roth-Del_Masona</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRothDelMasona</string></dict>

        <key>Kento Marek</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.555.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kento Marek was a Human male who lived as a Knight of the Jedi Order. Upon the outbreak of the Clone Wars, he fought on the side of the Galactic Republic alongside his fellow Jedi. Commissioned as a Jedi officer like the rest of the Order's members, Marek eagerly led clone troopers into battle on many fronts. As common with the younger generations of the Jedi Order, Marek craved excitement, adventure and the opportunity to perform many heroic acts as a warrior. Hence, he saw the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists as the opportunity to demonstrate his skills as a Jedi and a leader.
            During the Clone Wars, Kento Marek became acquainted with a fellow Jedi named Mallie. Unlike Kento, Mallie had no interest in seeking fame and glory as a warrior. Her sympathy for those who suffered throughout the conflict caused Marek to rethink his personal views. Despite their differences, the two developed a close relationship with each other, which eventually culminated into love—an emotional attachment that was expressly forbidden by the long-standing tenets of the Jedi Order. In the midst of the galaxy-wide fighting, Kento and Mallie renounced their allegiance to the Order and married in secret. Due to their self-imposed exile, the two former Jedi Knights abandoned the war and went into hiding in order to start a new life together.
            Their desertion saved their own lives when, upon the decree of Order 66, the clone troopers betrayed and murdered their Jedi officers on thousands of fronts all over the galaxy. The systematic genocide extended to ex-Jedi as well, thus turning Kento and Mallie into fugitives. As the Galactic Empire ascended to replace the former Republic, the Mareks had settled on the planet Kashyyyk where they were hidden and protected by the native Wookiee population.
            For ten years, Kento hid on Kashyyyk, avoiding detection from the Empire. At some point after their arrival, Mallie became pregnant and gave birth to a son, Galen Marek. Shortly afterward, she was killed while trying to defend a group of Wookiees from Trandoshan slavers. Forced to raise their only child by himself, Kento and his son were still living on Kashyyyk when the Sith Lord Darth Vader launched a massive invasion on Kashyyyk. With the secrecy of his hidden location compromised, Kento Marek resumed his former role as a Jedi Knight and aided the Wookiees in defending their homeworld. When the battle was all but lost, Kento Marek made his last stand against Vader in front of his hut. After a brief duel, Kento was easily defeated by the more powerful Sith Lord. Upon his death, Vader took it upon himself to raise the Jedi's young son as his secret apprentice.
            In accordance with the strict recruiting policy of the Jedi Order, Kento Marek's connection to the Force was detected by the Order when he was a young child. Raised and trained within the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Marek eventually passed his final trials as a Padawan learner and ascended to the rank of Jedi Knight. Like many other young Jedi, Marek was extremely confident in his status as a Jedi, but also proud and arrogant to a fault.[3]
            When the Clone Wars began in the year 22 BBY, Marek was eager to pursue the opportunity to prove his skills and abilities in battle. He served as a Jedi officer in the Grand Army of the Republic, along with the rest of the Order's members. Commanding armies of clone troopers, Marek fought on various battlefields. As a thrill-seeker, he reveled in the fighting and took pride in his accomplishments as a general.[3]
            Kento Marek's responsibilities as a Jedi General eventually brought him to a Core world of Talus. During that time, he became acquainted with Mallie, a fellow Jedi and self-styled freedom fighter. Unlike Marek's eagerness for battlefield glory, Mallie felt neither excitement or desire to fight in the Clone Wars. She strongly sympathized with anyone who suffered in one capacity or another due to the effects of the galactic-spanning conflict. Although they possessed different point of views at the time, the two Jedi were able to develop a rapport with each other.[3]
            Marek's exposure to Mallie's personal views created a change within him that reshaped his original way of thinking. In losing his youthful desire for fame and recognition over his achievements, Marek came to share Mallie's sympathy towards others. As their relationship grew, Marek fell in love with Mallie, despite the Jedi Order's restrictions against love and other emotional attachments. Mallie also violated the Jedi Code by returning Marek's feelings.[3][4]
            Before the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Kento and Mallie married each other in secret. In doing so, they renounced their allegiance to the Jedi Order and became exiles in order to start a new life together. Ironically, their actions ultimately saved their lives. When Chancellor Palpatine, the public persona of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, issued Order 66 to the Grand Army, thousands of Jedi officers were murdered by their own clone soldiers throughout the galaxy.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kento_Marek</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKentoMarek</string></dict>
        <key>Galen Marek</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.556.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Galen Marek (pronounced /ɡeɪlən ˈmæɹɛk/), codenamed Starkiller, was a Force-sensitive Human male who trained in the ways of the dark side of the Force as the secret apprentice of the Sith Lord Darth Vader. The son of two Jedi Knights—Kento Marek and his wife, Mallie—Galen was born with an exceptionally powerful connection to the Force. Intrigued by the boy's potential, Vader abducted Galen from his home planet of Kashyyyk and raised him to embrace the teachings of the Sith. Having been taken by the Dark Lord of the Sith at a young age, Galen ultimately forgot his past along with his birth name, and only knew himself by the call sign of "Starkiller."
            Though essentially trained as a Sith apprentice, the Rule of Two prevented Starkiller from truly claiming the title of Sith Lord. He therefore dedicated years of his life to becoming strong enough to help Vader overthrow his own Sith Master, Darth Sidious, the Emperor of the galaxy. In 3 BBY, three years before the Battle of Yavin, Starkiller was deemed ready by his master to hunt Jedi targets. As a result, the Jedi fugitives Rahm Kota, Kazdan Paratus, and Shaak Ti were defeated, in turn, by Vader's assassin. Having emerged triumphant against all three Jedi Masters in single combat, Starkiller believed that the time had come to confront Sidious at his master's side. Instead, Vader betrayed and severely wounded his apprentice at the behest of his own master. Despite this turn of events, Starkiller was saved by Vader and ordered to raise a rebellion against the Empire, leading the apprentice to believe that their plan to depose Sidious was still in motion.
            Operating under the guise of a Jedi, Starkiller recruited several malcontents to his movement, including the Imperial senators Bail Prestor Organa, Garm Bel Iblis, and Mon Mothma. Together, they formally established the Alliance to Restore the Republic, at which point Vader betrayed Starkiller once more by capturing the Rebel leaders and leaving his apprentice for dead on the planet Corellia. Starkiller not only survived, but pursued his master to the Death Star in a quest to save his newfound allies from the Emperor. In doing so, the former apprentice embraced his Jedi heritage and reclaimed his original identity as Galen Marek.
            Upon defeating his former master in a lightsaber duel, Marek was tempted—with Sidious' encouragement—to strike down Darth Vader and take his place in the Order of the Sith Lords. Rather than succumbing to the dark side once more, Marek chose to sacrifice his life in order to save the senators. In his final moments, Marek's thoughts were with Juno Eclipse, the woman he developed an emotional attachment to during his time as Vader's apprentice. His death as a martyr had a galvanizing effect on the Rebels, who adopted the Marek family crest to honor their fallen leader, as they went to war against the Empire. Marek's legacy would also live on through a series of clones commissioned by Vader in an effort to create a more powerful and obedient version of Starkiller. To that end, Marek's corpse was taken to Kamino where it was used as a genetic template, resulting in the creation of numerous failures as well as two relatively stable clones—Subject 1138 and the Dark Apprentice.
            Galen Marek was a Human male who lived during the height of the Galactic Empire and the Great Jedi Purge. The son of a Jedi Knight, Kento Marek and a young Jedi freedom fighter named Mallie, Galen Marek was born with an extremely powerful connection to the Force. His parents, both of whom were members of the Jedi Order, married in secret during the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems which they continued to participate in until Mallie became pregnant. As a result, they reluctantly deserted the Jedi Order and fled to the Outer Rim Territories sometime before Order 66, a contingency directive that instructed all Republic clone troopers to execute their Jedi officers—the culmination of a Sith plot to exterminate their ancient rivals while simultaneously transforming the Republic into a dictatorship. The war itself had been orchestrated by the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, who turned the clone army against the Jedi through his public guise as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, shortly before his ascension as emperor of the galaxy.[4]
            The Marek family was constantly on the run, moving from one planet after another in an effort to at anonymity in the increasing tensions of the war. They ultimately settled on Kashyyyk, sometime shortly before or soon after Order 66. However, their new life was cut short when Mallie was killed while protecting Wookiees[4] from Trandoshan[5] mercenaries and slave traders, leaving her husband to raise Galen alone. When Imperial spies learned of the Jedi's fight with the slavers, a large military force was deployed to Kashyyyk under the command of the Emperor's apprentice, the Sith Lord Darth Vader. During the battle, Vader defeated Kento Marek in a lightsaber duel and discovered the latter's son. Impressed by Galen's potential in the Force,[4] as demonstrated by his reflexive use of telekinesis,[1] Vader abducted the younger Marek shortly after he killed the boy's father and a squad of stormtroopers in order to keep Galen's existence a secret. Despite his outward loyalty to Palpatine, Vader harbored much hatred toward his Sith Master and intended to overthrow him with Marek as his secret apprentice. As such, he endeavored to teach the ways of the dark side of the Force to his new disciple, whom he first controlled through fear before training Marek to harness his anger and other base emotions.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galen_Marek</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGalenMarek</string></dict>

        <key>Mandalore the Vindicated</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.558.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Artus Lok was a Human male Mandalorian warrior of Clan Lok who lived during the Great Galactic War, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. Sometime after the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, the reigning Mandalore—seeking to regain support after being defeated during the Blockade of the Hydian Way—organized a competition for glory known as the Great Hunt, which was held on a galactic scale. Artus eventually became the Grand Champion of the Great Hunt, and challenged the Mandalore to a duel in the gladiatorial arenas on the planet Geonosis. He successfully killed the Mandalorian leader and took the title of Mandalore the Vindicated. He began to consolidate his power over the Mandalorian clans, destroying an uprising led by Jicoln Cadera, who believed the Mandalorians should support the Republic. After defeating Cadera's faction, Mandalore the Vindicated ensured that his Mandalorians remained allies of the Sith Empire.
            Artus Lok, a Human male, was a Mandalorian warrior who lived during the Great Galactic War, which was a galactic conflict between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. Seven years prior to the Sacking of Coruscant, the reigning Mandalore—who was a puppet ruler secretly serving the Sith Empire—was defeated during the Blockade of the Hydian Way. After this, Mandalore organized a galaxy-wide competition for glory, known as the Great Hunt. Artus fought during the competition, eventually becoming the Grand Champion of the Great Hunt.[1]
            Artus challenged Mandalore to a duel[1] in the gladiatorial arenas on the planet Geonosis.[2] He killed the Mandalorian leader and assumed the title of Mandalore the Vindicated. After defeating the Mandalore—who became known as Mandalore the Lesser—he began to consolidate his power over the Mandalorian clans. During this time, Mandalore defeated an uprising by a faction of Mandalorians led by Jicoln Cadera, who believed that the Mandalorians should follow the ways of Mandalore the Preserver[1]—who fought during the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War three centuries prior[4]—and support the Republic. After defeating Cadera's Mandalorians, Mandalore the Vindicated ensured that his Mandalorians remained well-paid, yet cautious, allies of the Sith Empire.[1] Under his leadership, the Mandalorians prospered. However, several of his contemporaries believed that their Mandalore was not content with being an ally of the Sith, and secretly harbored greater ambitions.[5]
            During the Cold War, Artus summoned the latest Grand Champion to his flagship, the Spirit of Vengeance. He commended the Hunter for avenging Hedarr Soongh, preventing the Great Hunt list from being leaked, and stopping Tarro Blood. He sent the Hunter to Dromund Kaas to kill a Sithspawn and bring its heart as a trophy. Upon his Champion's successful return, Artus introduced the other Grand Champions, Bloodworthy, Jewl'a Nightbringer and the Defenestrator. He declared the Hunter worthy of gaining access to the Blacklist, a confidential list of impossible bounties reserved only to the Grand Champions.
            Artus then confessed that with war threatening to reignite, he wanted the Hunter to stand as his replacement among the Grand Champions, revealing that slaying the Sithspawn was a test. The Hunter gladly accepted his offer and became a Mandalorian.
            When a Republic strike team sent by Jun Seros assaulted the Grand Champions' party on Nar Shaddaa to celebrate the Hunter's successful Blacklist kills, killing Bloodworthy, Jewl'a, and Defenestrator, Artus sent a message to his surviving Champion, demanding that they avenge their fallen comrades upon the cowardly Republic scum.
            Artus was later present on Ilum as part of the emergency war council gathered to discuss Darth Malgus' New Empire.[6]
            During the Eternal Empire's Conquest, Mandalore summoned all of the clans to him. It was rumored that the Mandalorians continued to fight against the Eternal Empire, but no one had seen physical proof. Mandalore the Vindicated was said to have died in a battle against the Eternal Empire, members of his clan saw him being swarmed by Skytroopers. The manner of the Mandalore's death would later cause a grudge to form within the clans regarding droids. Shae Vizla reluctantly took on the mantle of Mandalore sometime after Artus' death.
            Mandalore the Vindicated was a tall human male with dark skin and dark hair which he kept shaven. He had hardened facial features, however he was not as gruff as many other Mandalorians.
            Mandalore the Vindicated was respected, even revered by his people. He had once held a deep friendship with former Clan chief of Cadera, Jicoln Cadera. But when Artus defeated the puppet Mand'alor and claimed the title, he and Jicoln fought each other for their views soon clashed. Despite having defeated his former friend and promised to destroy Torian Cadera, he never carry out his promise but left him alive, indicating there's possible regret in his actions. Mandalore still chose aid the Sith but not firmly as he was cautious of their allies. Artus Lok was also known for a hatred for the bloodthirsty Mandalorian clan chieftain Mavrix Varad, calling him a 'Rancor with a forming mouth', showing he has standards when it comes to what he expects from his warriors as shown with his dislike for the dishonorable Mandalorian, Tarro Blood.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mandalore_the_Vindicated</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMandaloretheVindicated</string></dict>
        <key>Mandalore the Lesser</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.559.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mandalore the Lesser was the title bestowed upon the Human male leader of the Mandalorian warrior clans during the Great Galactic War and the Cold War. Before becoming Mandalore, the man was a young member of the then-scattered warrior clans. He lived on Geonosis as one of the many Mandalorian gladiators who participated in arena fights for prestige. Although he was a proficient fighter in his own right, his rise to fame was dramatically accelerated by the intervention of Imperial Intelligence, an espionage agency of the reconstituted Sith Empire.
            Agents of Imperial Intelligence identified the young man as a possible pawn they could use to reunite the Mandalorian clans and direct them into an alliance with the Sith. The agents fast-tracked his path to infamy by rigging his gladiatorial matches and spreading the word that he was to become the new warrior-king of his people, Mandalore. He accepted the title and the power it carried, but became subservient to the Empire that built him. As an act of loyalty, the new Mandalore directed his followers to blockade the Hydian Way. The blockade crippled the Galactic Republic against whom the Empire was fighting and placed the Sith as the apparent victors of the Great Galactic War.
            Although the blockade on the Hydian Way lasted for a year, it was eventually broken by intrepid smugglers led by the Mirialan Hylo Visz. After the conflict, Mandalore needed to re-energize his people, and so organized the Great Hunt—a galaxy-wide competition for glory. The Hunt's victor challenged the Mandalore to a duel and won, killing the warrior-king and claiming the title for himself; becoming Mandalore the Vindicated. It was later revealed to the galaxy that the Mandalore who had risen to fame on Geonosis was nothing more than an Imperial puppet, and history remember him as "the lesser" of the Mandalores.
            During the Great Galactic War, the Sith Empire tried to recruit the Mandalorians to fight for them. But only a small number of them chose to join. In an attempt to gain all the Mandalorians, Imperial Intelligence decided to find a new Mandalore to reunite the scattered warriors.
            The individual who would become this new Mandalore was initially a gladiator fighting in the arenas of Geonosis. Aside from his incredible skills, Imperial Intelligence would sabotage his opponents so he would always win. After rising to prominence there, he took the title of Mandalore and called for the scattered Mandalorians to reunite. The Mandalorians answered, and he promised to lead them to great glory. In reality, the new Mandalore was a Sith puppet.
            The Sith's new alliance with the Mandalore brought the stalemate in the war to a swift end as he led the Mandalorians to blockade the Hydian Way.
            The blockade rendered the Hydian inaccessible, hindering the Republic war effort and causing a major economic depression in the Core Worlds. The Knights of the Jedi Order, fighting on behalf of the Republic, attempted to break the blockade; however, the Mandalorians soundly defeated them. Seeing a profit to be made in victory against the Mandalorians, the Mirialan smuggler Hylo Visz later led her fellow smugglers in a battle against the blockade which resulted in the defeat of the Mandalore's warriors and the opening of the Rimma Trade Route.
            Some time after the Treaty of Coruscant was signed, Mandalore the Lesser attempted to re-energize the Mandalorians and restore his support among them by reviving a several centuries old competition that spanned the galaxy, known as the Great Hunt.  The victor of this "new" Great Hunt, however, challenged Mandalore the Lesser to a duel in which he killed Mandalore the Lesser by shooting him to death, and then proclaimed himself the new Mandalore.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mandalore_the_Lesser</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMandaloretheLesser</string></dict>
        <key>Zeerid Korr</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.560.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zeerid Korr, also known as Z-man, was a male Human smuggler who was a former Republic Army commando in the Havoc Squad and later joined The Exchange during the Great Galactic War and the start of the Cold War between the Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire. He fought at the Battle of Balmorra together with the Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer and they became friends. After transporting Leneer to face Darth Malgus, he left for Vulta to pick up his daughter and move to Dantooine and became a farmer, where he later was reunited with Aryn Leneer, for whom he had romantic feelings.
            Little is known about Korr's early life. However, he served as a commando in the Republic's Havoc Squadron against the Sith Empire. He demonstrated exceptional skill as a star pilot, rivaling even Jedi pilots. He also learned skills with blasters and unarmed combat, to the point where he was capable of killing a man with a single strike. During the crucial Battle of Balmorra, Korr became steadfast friends with Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer. Korr's time in the military was tragically cut short by the sudden death of his wife Val and injury of his daughter Arra. It was Leneer who supported Korr in his mourning. Leaving the army to attempt to provide for his now legless daughter, Korr was unable to find any legal way to earn the credits to care for his family, and was forced to use his skills as a soldier and pilot to become a smuggler in service to the Exchange, a criminal organization. Desperate to get enough credits to provide Arra with prostheses, or at least a hoverchair, Korr (under the pseudonym Z-Man) undertook weapons-running missions all over the Outer Rim.
            Korr was placed under the direction of a handler known as Oren, a man who he knew next to nothing about. Oren would task him with different weapon smuggling assignments. On several occasions, these missions ended in ambush, and Korr soon found himself in massive debt to the Exchange. After a particularly disastrous mission on Ord Mantell and a battle with a group of pirates that he survived thanks to his military skills, After Oren learned of the mission's failure, Korr was tasked with doing spice runs to compensate for the lost cargo. Korr was extremely reluctant to help anyone get ahold of any kind of spice, but had no other option, as his debt only continued to grow. As this was happening, the Sith Empire under Darth Malgus launched a surprise attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant, destroying the Jedi Temple and probably murdering many members of the Galactic Senate, the Chancellor included. Blockading the planet, the Sith made it nearly impossible for the criminal underworld to operate on Coruscant. Because of this, the spice addicts that partook in engspice brought in from offworld would suffer from withdrawals. Oren offered Korr an ultimatum: if he delivered engspice to Coruscant, bypassing the Imperial blockade, then he would be cleared of his debts. If he refused, they would terminate him. Negotiating the terms of the arrangement, Korr managed to coerce the Exchange into depositing 100,000 credits into his account before his departure.
            This arrangement being made, Korr journeyed to his homeworld of Vulta to finally give Arra the hoverchair he'd dreamed of buying for her. He purchased the chair and delivered it to his daughter, who was at the time being cared for by Korr's sister-in-law, Nat. Korr then learned of their harsh living conditions, which were caused by Nat's low pay, and Korr promised them that he would soon have enough to help them out of their situation once and for all, though he refused to explain how, as he kept his illegal jobs a secret from his daughter. But the engspice delivery had attracted the attention of the Hutt crime lords, who were looking to become involved in the business of spice running. Dispatching a bounty hunter called Vrath Xizor, a former Imperial sniper (a skulker, as they were colloquially called by Republic soldiers), the Hutts ordered that Z-Man be terminated before the spice could arrive at Coruscant. Korr (unknowingly) nearly stopped the plan before it even began, when he found Xizor watching his family in a park, but the man was able to convince Korr that he had no harmful intentions. Still, for guarded Nat's apartment for a few hours, leading him to receive an unexpected visit.
            Korr had a surprising reunion with Aryn Leneer on Vulta just prior to his departure. Leneer, upon learning of the Sith attack and the death of her Master Ven Zallow, requested that Korr transport her to Coruscant. She was then unaware of the cargo of Fatman, Korr's starship. Making their way to the spaceport, Korr and Leneer were ambushed unexpectedly by Vrath and a group of mercenaries that accompanied him. After killing multiple of them and narrowly escaping Vulta, Korr and Leneer jumped into hyperspace. Employing cunning uncharacteristic of a smuggler, Korr latched the ship onto an unaware Imperial transport, and arrived at Coruscant in the shadow of the transport. Korr and Leneer nearly made it through the blockade. Vrath, however, had arrived at Coruscant and notified Darth Malgus of the imminent arrival of the smuggler, Jedi Knight, and their illegal cargo.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zeerid_Korr</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZeeridKorr</string></dict>

        <key>Jace Malcom</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.562.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jace Malcom was a Human male Republic trooper, who served in the Special Forces Division of the Republic Military during the Great Galactic War and Cold War, and as the military's Supreme Commander during the Galactic War. Malcom grew up on the Mid Rim world of Barcaria, but left at a young age to join the Galactic Republic's defense forces. By 3681 BBY, he was serving as a corporal aboard a Jedi-run space station in orbit above Korriban. In that year, the reconstituted Sith Empire returned to known space to reclaim their lost territory and exact revenge upon the Republic. During these early days of the ensuing Great Galactic War, the Empire launched a massive strike against the Jedi and Republic forces at Korriban in an effort to retake the world which had once been their holy capital. Malcom was caught in the battle, but managed to escape the onslaught alongside Jedi Padawan Satele Shan and incarcerated smuggler, Captain Nico Okarr.
            The war continued on for nearly three decades, during which time Malcom was inducted into the Republic Army's Special Forces and granted command of the elite infantry unit 326. Under Malcom's leadership, the unit performed highly risky raids into enemy territory and earned the moniker of "Havoc Squad." At the height of the war, the squad was stationed on the Core World of Alderaan while the bulk of the Republic Navy was elsewhere in the galaxy, combating the Sith. While he was stationed on the planet, Malcom and his troopers were swept up in the Battle of Alderaan, a massive Imperial invasion of the tranquil world. As the Sith forces led by Darth Malgus ravaged the planet, Malcom and his comrades took to the forests of Alderaan to wage a guerrilla campaign against the Imperials. When Darth Malgus turned his army toward the Alderaanian capital city, the commander and Havoc Squad positioned themselves to ambush the Sith Lord and halt his advance. In a pitched battle in the forests outside of the capital, Havoc Squad routed the Imperial Army and Malcom fought and defeated Malgus himself with the aid of then-Jedi Knight Satele Shan.
            Malcom's leadership during the battle earned him and Havoc Squad great prestige throughout the Republic and inspired continued resilience against the Sith. This fame attracted the attention of Colonel Elin Garza, with whom Malcom helped found a new, fully-fledged and independent Special Forces Division. Around the same time, Malcom fostered a secret relationship with Shan that ultimately culminated in a tense breakup. However, before their romantic relationship died, Malcom and Shan sired a son, Theron Shan. Malcom later received a promotion to the rank of colonel.
            Following the end of the war and the implementation of a controversial peace agreement, Malcom was asked to return to Alderaan to oversee the efforts of Republic combatants in the bloody civil war that had engulfed the planet. As the Strategic Advisor to Alderaan for the Republic Army, Malcom monitored troop deployments and tactical plans and maintained the military alliance between the Republic's armed forces and the noble House Organa. Under his supervision, the despotic King Bouris Ulgo was deposed and the Organas solidified their advantage in the war over the Imperial-backed House Thul. Later in the war, Malcom was promoted to Supreme Commander of the Republic Military, during which time he aided then-Grand Master Satele Shan and Jedi Master Gnost-Dural in a battle against Darth Karrid and a renewed Sith offensive.
            Jace Malcom was a Human male who lived approximately three centuries after the Jedi Civil War.[6] Malcom was a strong supporter of the Galactic Republic and joined the Republic Military as an Army officer around 3683 BBY.[7][8] Within two years, Malcom had been accepted into the ranks of the army's elite troopers, and by 3681 BBY,[9] Malcom had attained the rank of corporal and was serving the government while stationed[10] in the Outer Rim Territories[11] aboard a space station orbiting above the Republic's protectorate world of Korriban. There, Malcom served alongside fellow troopers and members of the Jedi Order to maintain a constant vigil over the planet that had once been home to the ancient Sith Empire.[10] In that year, a reformed Empire of the Sith emerged from hiding in the Unknown Regions and launched a massive surprise assault against the Republic. The Imperials' early campaigns focused primarily in the galaxy's distant Tingel Arm region, and pulled the bulk of the Republic's navy away from their previous duties and into battle against the Sith.[12]
            As a result of the fighting, Korriban lost most of its naval defenses, and was left with only a small defense force[12] consisting of the Republic troopers aboard the space station[10] and the Jedi guardians who were watching over the Sith's holy world.[12] While the battles elsewhere continued to rage, Malcom served under the Zabrak Jedi Master Kao Cen Darach and his Padawan learner, Satele Shan. Together, the three of them intercepted and arrested the smuggler captain Nico Okarr on the surface of the planet[13] and ferried him back to be detained aboard the Korriban station. The smuggler captain had been caught while transporting Sith artifacts and was being taken into custody when the young Shan sensed a disturbance in the Force. At that moment, a fleet of over thirty Sith battlecruisers emerged from hyperspace above the Korriban and began to assault the space station with starfighters and boarding parties. Master Darach decided that their first priority in the battle must be to escape the system and inform the larger Republic that the Empire had returned to its ancient homeworld. Although he agreed, Malcom insisted that none of the Republic's NR2 gully jumper shuttles would be able to outrun the attacking Imperial interceptors. Okarr, who had been listening in on the conversation, offered his own XS stock light freighter the Redshifter as a means of escape,[10] as it was allegedly the fastest ship in the Esstran sector.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jace_Malcom</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJaceMalcom</string></dict>
        <key>Baze Malbus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.563.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Baze Malbus was a human male born on the desert moon of Jedha fifty-three years before the Battle of Yavin. Once a devoted member of the Guardians of the Whills, Malbus became a freelance assassin during the age of the Galactic Empire. Nevertheless, he maintained a friendship with Chirrut Îmwe, who also served with the Guardians. Following the destruction of Jedha City, Malbus and Îmwe became part of the Rebel group known as Rogue One. After Îmwe's death in an explosion during the Battle of Scarif, Malbus rushed the Imperial death troopers and was killed by a C-25 fragmentation grenade.
            Born in 53 BBY on the desert moon of Jedha, Baze Malbus joined the Guardians of the Whills alongside his best friend Chirrut Îmwe. As members of the religious order, they were tasked with guarding the Temple of the Kyber in Jedha City.[2]
            In the aftermath of the Proclamation of the New Order, the holy city of NiJedha was occupied by the armed forces of the Galactic Empire.[2] The harsh conditions of Imperial occupation transformed Malbus into a cynical soldier, although he also remained lifelong friends with the spiritual Îmwe.[3]
            By 0 BBY, approximately two decades into the Age of the Empire, Malbus and Îmwe encountered Jyn Erso and Captain Cassian Andor of the Rebel Alliance in NiJedha. During the ensuing insurgent attack on Imperial troops, Îmwe came to Erso and Andor's aid and defeated a group of stormtroopers, leading Malbus to shoot several more troopers in order to protect his blind comrade. The two friends and their Rebel acquaintances were subsequently captured and taken to the Catacombs of Cadera by Saw Gerrera's followers, but ultimately managed to escape when the Death Star obliterated NiJedha.[2]
            Malbus and Îmwe followed the Rebels on their mission to Eadu—the location of Galen Erso, Jyn's father and the chief scientist responsible for the creation of the Empire's new battle station. The assignment led to a firefight between Imperial and Alliance forces, resulting in the death of the elder Erso. After the battle, Malbus accompanied his allies to the Alliance headquarters on Yavin 4.[2]
            Shortly after their arrival, Jyn Erso made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the Alliance leaders in sending a fleet to Scarif, believing her late father's revelation that a fatal flaw in the Death Star's design could be found in its schematics. In spite of the Alliance leadership's unwillingness to act, Erso was joined by Malbus, Îmwe, and a group of soldiers in an unsanctioned mission to Scarif. The newly formed Rogue One successfully infiltrated the Imperial stronghold, but were forced to fight a battle against the planet's garrison while Erso and Andor searched for the plans in the Imperial security complex. During the battle, Îmwe sacrificed his life to help deactivate the planetary deflector shield, causing Malbus to begin repeating his good friend's mantra before proceeding to kill several death troopers, maintaining the offensive until he himself was killed by a grenade. Though the remaining members of Rogue One also perished, their sole mission ended in the successful transmission of the Death Star plans to the Alliance Fleet.[2]
            Baze Malbus was a human male who stood at 1.80 meters.[1] He had brown eyes, black hair, and tan skin.[2] Unlike the deeply spiritual Chirrut Îmwe, whom he regarded as his best friend and moral compass, Malbus had lost his sense of spirituality, including his belief in the Force, as a result of enduring the harsh conditions of Imperial occupation on Jedha. In contrast to Îmwe, Malbus developed a pragmatic viewpoint[3] but ultimately reaffirmed his faith in the Force after his friend's death on Scarif.[2]
            Malbus was highly adept at long-range combat. His preferred weapon was the heavy repeater cannon, which he could utilize with expert marksmanship.[3]
            Baze Malbus is portrayed by Jiang Wen in the Star Wars Anthology Series film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Wen's casting in the film was first announced on August 15, 2015. At this time, the first photo of the character was released as well.[5] The first footage of the character was shown in the Rogue One teaser trailer on April 7, 2016.[6]
            Baze and Chirrut replaced another pair featured in early treatments of the story—that of the aliens Senna and Lunak. Lunak was cut entirely from the final version of the movie, while Senna eventually became the mercenary Moroff.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Baze_Malbus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBazeMalbus</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Malgus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.564.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Malgus was a Human male Sith Lord of the resurgent Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War. He was born under the name Veradun within Imperial space, and raised by his adoptive father. While still young, Veradun killed a Twi'lek servant on his father's estate, revealing the dark will behind his sensitivity to the Force. The young boy was subsequently sent to the Sith Academy on the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas, where he became a Sith Warrior and a successful commander of the Imperial Military. During a trip to the Outer Rim world of Geonosis, Veradun discovered the Twi'lek slave girl Eleena Daru and took her as his own. Although she was technically his slave, the two fell in love with one another and fought side by side in many battles during the Great Galactic War against the Galactic Republic. Veradun later eschewed his birth name and adopted the Sith moniker of Darth Malgus.
            In the beginning, Malgus and his Master Vindican had led the victorious recapture of the Sith world Korriban, before the former struck down the latter for being injured at the hands of Jedi Master Kao Cen Darach. At the height of the war, Malgus led a surprise assault on the Core World of Alderaan; though initially successful, Malgus and his forces were defeated in a concentrated Republic counterattack led by his nemesis from Korriban, future Grand Master Satele Shan. The Sith Lord was heavily wounded during the battle, and was forced to wear a respirator for the remainder of his life. In 3653 BBY, the Empire entered into sham peace negotiations with the Republic, which were truthfully nothing more than a distraction from the Sith's true target: the Republic capital of Coruscant. Malgus was chosen by his superior Darth Angral to participate in the attack on Coruscant as the leader of a strike team that would invade the Jedi Temple. Malgus succeeded in killing a substantial number of Jedi defenders — including Jedi Master Ven Zallow, who has been recognized as Malgus's most notable kill — before the Sith fleet arrived to lay waste to the rest of the world. By the end of the engagement, the Sith had destroyed the Jedi Temple, killed half of the members of the Jedi High Council, and disgraced the Jedi Order in the eyes of the Republic.
            Although Malgus had been under the impression that the Imperial Armada was going to raze Coruscant and destroy the Republic once and for all, the battle was ultimately used only as leverage in the peace negotiations on Alderaan. While the Alderaanian summit progressed, the Sith settled into an occupation of Coruscant. Malgus was placed in charge of orbital security, but the Sith Lord defied his orders and traveled back to Coruscant's surface to strike against the renegade Jedi Aryn Leneer, who was targeting Malgus for his murder of her Master, Ven Zallow. Although Leneer ultimately failed, the conflict caused Malgus to become disillusioned with the Empire and to review his relationship with Daru as a weakness. Thus, he was forced to kill his lover to preserve his own power, which he later used to cleanse the Empire of the politicians whom he blamed for allowing the Republic to survive. During the Cold War years that followed the successful peace negotiations, Malgus led Sith forces into the Unknown Regions, claiming previously-unknown territories for the Empire.
            Towards the end of the Cold War, following the presumed death of the Sith Emperor, Malgus came to the fore and declared a new Empire, one free of the infighting of the Dark Council. However, in time, he was tracked down to his secret base and defeated.
            Veradun was a Force-sensitive Human male born in the year 3701 BBY[2] on the planet Dromund Kaas, the capital of the reconstituted Sith Empire.[1] Veradun was raised by an adoptive father, a biologist in the Imperial Science Bureau, and the man maintained a private zoo on a planet other than Dromund Kaas with funding from the Empire where he collected and studied many different animals. As a child, Veradun tended to the creatures in the menagerie, feeding the animals and cleaning their cages. The young boy also participated in lessons on the Force with a number of instructors, all of whom recognized his great potential in the Force.[11]
            Sometime in his youth, a female Twi'lek servant on the estate of Veradun's father committed a minor offense. Although the offense itself was meaningless to Veradun, he killed the woman to prove to himself that he was capable of doing so. His father was pleased with his son's actions,[3] and so contacted the Sith Academy on the Imperial capital world of Dromund Kaas. Veradun was to leave the estate and train at the academy to become a Sith Warrior.[11]
            The day prior to Veradun's departure, his adoptive father took him on a tour of the zoo to teach him three lessons on personal conduct, deception, and expectations. The lessons, which his father crafted through the use of the animals and their behavior, had a profound impact on Veradun and shaped his philosophies for later in life. The next day, Veradun was taken to Dromund Kaas,[11] and he eventually became selected as an apprentice by the pureblood Sith Master Vindican.[8] On a trip to the Outer Rim world of Geonosis, Veradun discovered a young Twi'lek slave girl by the name of Eleena Daru. Upon seeing that Daru was abused and physically beaten by her owner, Veradun killed her master and took the Twi'lek as his own. Although she remained his slave, the two became lovers[3] and he eventually came to treat her as a wife,[1] despite the Empire's anti-alien policies.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Malgus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthMalgus</string></dict>
        <key>Malakili</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.565.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Malakili was a human male from the planet Corellia who spent much of his childhood living in the slums of the moon Nar Shaddaa. Having an affinity for animals, Malakili was hired as a beastmaster for Hutt circuses, but he was sold into slavery after a creature got loose and killed audience members. Purchased by Jabba the Hutt, Malakili served as a caretaker to the creatures in Jabba's Palace on the desert planet Tatooine. During that time, Malakili became fond of Jabba's rancor, Pateesa, and the creature saved his life during a Tusken Raider attack. Sympathizing with Pateesa, Malakili planned to one day escape with the beast.
            In 4 ABY, Luke Skywalker of the Rebel Alliance arrived at Jabba's Palace in an attempt to rescue Han Solo. Skywalker was tricked into Jabba's rancor pit, where, to Malakili's distress, the rebel killed Pateesa. In the aftermath, Skywalker escaped with Solo, and Jabba was killed. Over the following months, Malakili was one of the last to leave the palace, and he wandered into the Dune Sea toward the Great Pit of Carkoon. Feeling purposeless without his creatures, Malakili considered committing suicide, and he wandered further into the desert.
            In the desert, Malakili was attacked by the Red Key Raiders, criminals who had risen to power in Jabba's absence, but he was rescued by Sheriff Cobb Vanth and Issa-Or, self-proclaimed law enforcers. When the two learned Malakili was a beastmaster, they offered him a job in Freetown to work with rontos and teach a Huttlet. Malakili accepted the position and felt he had regained purpose. Vanth was concerned about the growing power of the Red Key Raiders, so with Malakili's help, the sheriff formed an alliance with a group of Tusken Raiders. Later, when Freetown was attacked by Red Key thugs, the Tusken Raiders arrived to help. Eventually, Malakili was reunited with Porcellus, the former head chef of Jabba's Palace. Together, they traveled to Mos Eisley and opened the Crystal Moon Restaurant.
            Malakili was a human male born on Corellia,[1] a planet in the galaxy's Core Worlds.[6] Malakili departed Corellia at a young age, winding up in the slums[4] of the Outer Rim moon[7] Nar Shaddaa. Skilled with handling beasts, Malakili spent his childhood training vicious creatures called gugverms to stop stealing from local food stores; with time, the gugverms became Malakili's pets, friends, and protectors.[4] Eventually, Malakili was hired as a beastmaster for traveling[1] Hutt circuses,[4] such as Circus Horrificus,[5] in which he domesticated and taught a variety of creatures, including sand dragons, kill-wings, costumed womp rats, and eventually rancors, monstrous creatures no one else could tame.[4] His circus career ended after a show on Nar Shaddaa, when one of the dangerous beasts got loose and killed audience members.[1]
            As a result of the incident, Malakili was made a slave[1] and, by 0 BBY,[8] was sold to Jabba Desilijic Tiure, a Hutt crime lord on the desert planet Tatooine.[1] Serving as a caretaker in Jabba's Palace, Malakili was responsible for tending to Jabba's menagerie of creatures, including the Hutt's prized[9] male rancor,[10] Pateesa,[4] who was named after the Huttese word for "friend."[10] Pateesa was purposed with eating prisoners, and Malakili would tend to the wounds he received doing so. During Malakili's time at Jabba's Palace, he became very fond of the rancor, and he, along with the Kadas'sa'Nikto Giran, considered Pateesa to be their favorite of Jabba's creatures. Pateesa also had a fondness for Malakili, and one day, when the beastmaster was attacked by Tusken Raiders, the rancor saved his life.[1] In Jabba's Palace, Malakili grew sympathetic toward Pateesa, and he planned to one day escape with the creature.[2]
            Shortly before the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY,[11] Jedi Luke Skywalker, a commander in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, attempted a bargain with Jabba to save the life of his captured friend, Han Solo. Jabba declined the offer and tricked the Jedi,[3] who, along with the Gamorrean guard Jubnuk,[5] fell through a trap door leading to the palace's rancor pit. While the guard was promptly eaten by Pateesa, Skywalker evaded the beast's claws and ran under the pit's gate toward a windowed back door. When Skywalker reached the exit, he discovered it was locked from the other side and would not open for him.[3] Malakili and Giran were in the adjoining chamber, playfully fighting over their dinner, and when Skywalker tried opening the barred gate, the two laughed at the rebel and used spears to force him away.[12]
            As the rancor approached Skywalker, the cornered Jedi picked up a skull, and he used the Force to propel it toward the gate's utility panel. The bone smashed the button, causing the panel to short-circuit and release the gate down upon the rancor's head, crushing the beast's skull.[13] Shocked,[9] Malakili opened the door, rushed to Pateesa's side, and wept upon seeing he was dead. Whimpering, Malakili turned away from the fallen beast, placing an arm around Giran for comfort.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malakili</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMalakili</string></dict>
        <key>Whie Malreaux</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.566.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Whie Malreaux was a Human male Jedi Padawan of the Jedi Order and a Commander during the Clone Wars.
            From a very young age, it was clear that the graceful, controlled Whie was strong with the Force. The Gran Jedi Master Maks Leem took him on as her Padawan learner. One of Whie's gifts was the ability to see the future in his dreams and meditations; premonitions. At first, this frightened him, but he learned to live with it by taking to heart that the future was always in motion; nothing was set.
            His homeworld, Vjun, was a barren world where poison rain fell from the sky. Whie's family was one of the wealthiest on the planet, and lived in a castle: the Château Malreaux. The better families on Vjun traditionally had very high midi-chlorian counts, which was a mark of status among them. After a trade route was set up with the Galactic Republic, the Jedi became involved, wanting to take away the Force-sensitive babies for Jedi training.
            Whie's father, the Viscount, was extremely interested in the midi-chlorian phenomenon, and tried to genetically enhance natural midi-chlorians in Vjun's population. The experiment was only a partial success; the people went mad and started killing each other. Whie's mother Whirry, half drunk and crazy, gave him away to a passing Jedi.
            While training at the Jedi Temple, Whie developed an infatuation with a fellow apprentice named Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy, a pretty, athletic girl a year older than him.
            Near the end of the Clone Wars, Count Dooku had taken over Château Malreaux and made it into his hiding place, where he set up a trap for the Order's most powerful Jedi Master, Yoda. The Jedi Master selected a small group of Jedi to come along with him to Vjun. Whie was among them, as was his Master Maks Leem, fellow Padawan Scout, and her Master Jai Maruk. During the mission, Whie dreamed his own death in a vision.
            While Yoda confronted Count Dooku, Scout and Whie ran into Asajj Ventress. Both Padawans were captured and Scout was held by a Force-grip. Ventress, sensing Whie's feelings for Scout, tried to tempt Whie to the dark side by telling him to kiss Scout. Holding the life of Scout in her hand, she forced him to choose. Whie was in doubt, but Scout managed to say that he would make the right choice, upon which he did.
            Yoda was able to escape from Dooku's trap, and Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi came to the rescue. Ventress stole a shuttle and escaped. The Jedi returned to Coruscant together, but Whie couldn't tell if he would ever feel at home again in the Jedi Temple. Yoda told him that he would always be home if he could feel the Force around him.
            Whie was one of the Padawans in the Jedi Temple during the execution of Order 66. He was sparring with Bene when Darth Vader entered the Room of a Thousand Fountains in the Temple. Whie did not survive his encounter with the newly-named Sith Lord as he charged and was cut across the chest just as he had seen in one of his dreams. Ironically, upon first meeting Anakin before, he had, in a fit of hysteria, hugged him and exclaimed: "I'm so glad you're not coming to kill me!" Cin Drallig and Bene were soon to follow as victims of Vader.
            When the Galactic Empire emerged, official records compiled by Sate Pestage stated that Whie was executed while in the act of mind-controlling the citizens of the Temple Precinct.
            Whie was portrayed by Coinneach Alexander in Revenge of the Sith. Coinneach's father, Peter Alexander, the sensei (teacher) of Byron Bay Kendo Club, appeared with his students as Jedi in the First Battle of Geonosis arena scene in Attack of the Clones.[source?]
            Though Whie's first appearance was in Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, he was originally created for Revenge of the Sith and used by author Sean Stewart when LucasBooks suggested he use a movie character in that role.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Whie_Malreaux/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWhieMalreaux</string></dict>
        <key>Malavai Quinn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.567.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Malavai Quinn was a male Human officer of Sith Empire born in the early years of the Great Galactic War. Raised in a military family, Malavai followed the footsteps of his father Rymar Quinn in joining the Imperial Military. During the Battle of Druckenwell he corrected a critical oversight by his superior Moff Broysc, allowing the Imperial victory, but was court-martialed for insubordination, ending up in a dead-end assignment on Balmorra. There he was absorbed into intelligence network of Sith Lord Darth Baras, who looked over Quinn's career for the next decade. Late in the Cold War Quinn assisted Baras' newest Sith apprentice in neutralizing his spy Rylon and stopping the Jedi Knight Mashallon from exposing Baras' network. As a reward, Baras awarded Quinn a posting of his choosing and the Captain choose to serve alongside the Sith apprentice, while remaining a spy for Baras.
            Quinn traveled with the apprentice for a long time, as the Sith grew more and more powerful, taking Jedi Padawan Jaesa Willsaam as an apprentice and killing Baras' master Darth Vengean on his orders. As the Sith's power grew, Baras set up a trap to end his apprentice's life, but the Sith was rescued by the Emperor's Hand and made the second Emperor's Wrath, tasked to undermine Baras' bid for power. Baras ordered Quinn to dispose of his former apprentice and Quinn set a trap for Wrath, luring the Sith to a space station and attacking the Wrath with two specially programmed assault droids at his side. However, the Wrath easily prevailed over Quinn, winning his loyalty and allowing him to remain at their side. The Wrath confronted Darth Baras on Korriban and killed him, after which the Dark Council fully acknowledged the Sith's authority. During his travels with the Sith, Quinn put a stop to Moff Broysc's incompetence, ending the loose end of the Republic Strategic Information Service agent Voloren and saving Major Ovech from a trap sprung through Broysc's inaction. Eventually, Quinn abducted Broysc and brought him to the Sith's Fury-class Imperial interceptor, where after receiving the Sith's permission he executed the Moff.
            The Emperor's Wrath went missing early on in the Eternal Empire conquest and Quinn spend months searching for the Sith. When ordered by the Sith Minister of Logistics Gelmid Lorman to call off the search, Quinn refused and was thrown into Imperial prison for his defiance. He remained imprisoned for years until Lorman was exposed for conspiring against Empress Acina, who pardoned Quinn and made him her new advisor. When the Empire received an anonymous intel regarding an immensely powerful superweapon on a recently rediscovered world of Iokath, Acina send Quinn as an ambassador to the Eternal Alliance Commander, with the orders to sabotage the meeting and escape should the Alliance turn against Empire. Taken captive by Lana Beniko who treated him as an assassin, Quinn presented himself to the Alliance Commander and arranged a formal holocall with the Empress.
            The son of Rymar Quinn, Malavai was born on Dromund Kaas around 3680 BBY.[1] As a child, he idolized the Imperial Guard, as service in that unit was the highest honor a non-Sith could achieve in the Empire.[2] Quinn became an officer of the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War, earning the rank of lieutenant by the time of Battle of Druckenwell in 3653 BBY, in which Quinn was a commanding officer assigned to Moff Broysc. Broysc made a critical oversight that nearly resulted in defeat, but Quinn chose to disobey the Moff's direct order and single-handedly returned the advantage to the Empire, resulting in a Republic defeat. However, Broysc was furious at the insubordination from Quinn, who had been tracking a Republic Strategic Information Service agent Voloren and had the man cornered when Broysc recalled Quinn to serve in the battle. The Moff took credit for Quinn's saving of the fleet, but chose to court-martial his subordinate. Fortunately for Quinn, the Sith Lord Darth Baras assigned Quinn to Balmorra, leaving Broysc to fume and block every transfer or promotion Quinn received during his time on the planet. Now part of Baras' massive intelligence network, Quinn remained posted on Balmorra for the next ten years.[3]
            In 3643 BBY Quinn was instructed by Baras' to assist his new Sith apprentice, who was on Balmorra with a mission to neutralize Baras' spy Commander Rylon. Rylon was embedded amongst the Balmorran resistance and Jedi Master Nomen Karr had sent an investigator to expose him. Malavai Quinn directed the apprentice in covering Rylon's tracks.[4] The most urgent was recovering data from a satellite control tower in the Markaran Plains that contained evidence of Rylon's involvement in sabotage of Balmorran defenses prior to imperial invasion.[5] The next target was Rylon's son Durmat, who knew of his father's true allegiance and was waiting to be interrogated by the Jedi investigator. The Sith apprentice eliminated Durmat in his cell before the Jedi arrived.[6] The Sith then went to confront Rylon at the Balmorran Arms Factory and killed him, however Quinn alerted the apprentice that the investigator sent by Nomen Karr was a Jedi Knight, who had recorded the conversation between the Sith and Rylon and was headed for the Sobrik spaceport. While the apprentice pursued the Jedi Mashallon, Quinn had intercepted her off-world transmissions, thereby keeping the Jedi in the dark.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malavai_Quinn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMalavaiQuinn</string></dict>
        <key>Malé-Dee</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.568.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Malé-Dee was a Human male senator from Uyter near the end of the Clone Wars.
            A Human male, Malé-Dee was born in the Visdic province of the planet Uyter. Later in life, Malé-Dee entered public service. Wearing traditional robes that indicated his province of origin, Malé-Dee also wore his hair in a distinctive fashion which symbolized his desire for peace.
            During the Clone Wars, a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Senator Lexi Dio represented Malé-Dee's homeworld, and was a member of the Loyalist Committee. Despite her position on the committee, Dio was outspoken in criticizing the Galactic Senate's expanded powers, and strongly opposed the Military Creation Act. After the Battle of Duro in 20 BBY,[1] however, Dio was assassinated, and Malé-Dee was elected to take her place.
            It was believed by his constituents that Malé-Dee would be less outspoken than his predecessor, and would take her place on the Loyalist Committee. Malé-Dee proved them wrong, however, and he too grew suspicious over Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's growing power over the Senate. Near the end of the war, Malé-Dee joined the Delegation of 2000, which presented Palpatine with the Petition of 2000; this document called for the Supreme Chancellor to relinquish his burgeoned powers at the war's conclusion, and denounced the renewed position of Moff. Palpatine was enraged by the screed, declaring its signatories to be traitors.
            Malé-Dee was played by Kee Chan in Revenge of the Sith. Malé-Dee's name comes from his simple identification as "Male Senator" during pre-production character design.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mal%C3%A9-Dee/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMaleDee</string></dict>

A cryptic group known as The Secret Order led the Grand Admiral to a Rebel base on the planet Thila, where he was attacked by the Order's Supreme Prophet, Kadann, after his first officer ridiculed the dress of the Order's members. Makati developed a deep hatred for the Supreme Prophet in the following years. The Grand Admiral escaped the destruction of the second Death Star and retreated to Coruscant, swearing his allegiance to whomever controlled Imperial City. Makati seemingly received a chance at revenge against Kadann when an impostor of the Supreme Prophet claimed the Imperial throne. Believing him to be genuine, Makati tracked down the impostor and trapped him on Scardia Station with the help of Azrakel, a former apprentice of the real Kadann. The Grand Admiral wiped out the rest of the false Prophets and killed the impostor in a hail of turbolaser fire. Makati himself died a short time later.
            Afsheen Makati was a Human male and one of twelve members of the Imperial Navy elevated to the rank of Grand Admiral by Emperor Palpatine during the New Year's Fete Week ceremony in 2 BBY.[2] Makati's service record was no more distinguished than numerous admirals in the Imperial Navy and his appointment was considered a surprise by many.[3] In the final years of the New Order, Makati commanded the Imperial Star Destroyer Steadfast.[4] During his service to the Empire, a shadowy Imperial group known as The Secret Order led Makati to a Rebel base on the planet Thila. After Makati's first officer made a snide remark about the dress of the Order's members, the Order's leader, Supreme Prophet Kadann, lashed out at Makati with Force lightning and ordered him to control his subordinates,[2] leaving the Grand Admiral badly injured.[4] Makati went on to harbor a great deal of hatred for Kadann after the incident. Along with Grand Admirals Nial Declann, Miltin Takel, and Osvald Teshik, Makati was present on the second Death Star during the Battle of Endor. He was able to escape the battlestation before it was destroyed by the Alliance and retreated from the ensuing chaos back to Coruscant.[2] After Palpatine's death above Endor, Makati remained loyal to the Empire, continuing to defend his territories while awaiting instructions from whoever succeeded the Emperor.[3] He was the subject of a New Republic information raid on an Imperial library on Boudolayz during the nascent government's hunt for the surviving Grand Admirals.[5]
            When Kadann's impostor claimed the Imperial throne for himself, Makati believed him to be the real Kadann, and his feelings of hatred resurfaced.[2] Makati refused the impostor's call to return to Coruscant to help him take over the planet[4] and requested permission from Imperial Intelligence Director Ysanne Isard, the current head of the Empire in opposition to the impostor, to hunt him down. Makati searched through Imperial Intelligence files and located Kadann's embittered former pupil, Azrakel, who also believed the impostor to be genuine.[2] At Makati's command, Azrakel provided details on the Lost City of the Jedi, where the impostor had been trapped, and Scardia Station, headquarters of the false Prophets.[4] Using this information, Makati was able to wipe out the false Prophets[6] and trap the false Kadann, who had recently escaped the Lost City with the help of the mutant Triclops, on Scardia Station. Makati announced his victory over the impostor on the station's comm system, mocking his sparkling robe. Using every turbolaser at his disposal, Makati destroyed the station and killed the impostor, fulfilling his revenge.[2][4] Makati met his own end soon after[2] while fighting to keep the Corporate Sector in Imperial hands,[3] and was able to gain some measure of true vengeance post-mortem, as Azrakel was later able to track down and kill the real Kadann on Bosthirda.[6]
            Rather than turning warlord, as several of his colleagues did, Afsheen Makati remained loyal to whomever controlled Imperial City under the banner of the Empire. He was persistent in his vendetta against Kadann and his intense hatred for the Supreme Prophet after the incident at Thila nearly consumed the rest of his life. He began his quest for vengeance once the false Kadann laid claim to the Imperial throne, believing him to be the real Kadann. Makati was relentless in his search for the impostor's whereabouts, and once he located Azrakel, he was ruthless in disposing of the impostor and the other false Prophets, mocking the impostor just as the real Kadann had mocked him on Thila.[2]
            Makati was first mentioned in a throwaway line in Timothy Zahn's novel, Vision of the Future, published in 1998. He was later mentioned under Kadann's entry in The New Essential Guide to Characters and was eventually given a full back-story and a first name in the Star Wars Insider 66 article Who's Who: Imperial Grand Admirals, by Abel G. Peña and Daniel Wallace. He was given a further expansion in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Afsheen_Makati</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAfsheenMakati</string></dict>

He flew the TIE/LN starfighter designated Black 2 during the Battle of Yavin.
            In his youth, Mithel honed his skills poaching Bothan sky dragons in his father's T-16 skyhopper.
            Mauler had a son named Rejlii Mithel, who became a tractor beam operator on the Chimaera. He kept a holo of Rejlii on the control yoke of his TIE fighter.
            He had achieved twenty-seven Rebel kills prior to the Battle of Yavin, and he marked them by flames painted on the hull of his fighter. In addition, alongside Vader himself and fellow co-pilot "Backstabber", he had been infamously involved in various assaults on Ralltiir and Mon Calamari, which increased Black Squadron's reputation as the Empire's most feared squadron.
            Mithel's fighter was with Vader's TIE Advanced x1 when the Millennium Falcon entered the battle. When Vader's right wingman was killed, Mithel panicked and tried to avoid the freighter's laser fire, only to collide with Vader's TIE Advanced. Vader was sent spinning into deep space, while Mithel was killed when his fighter impacted against the trench wall and exploded.
            In the Marvel Comics adaptation of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, Mithel's last words are different than seen in the film.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mithel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMithel</string></dict>
        <key>Crix Madine</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.571.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Crix Madine was an Imperial Army officer who formed and led the notorious Storm commandos of the Imperial military. In light of later missions, such as releasing a plague on Dentaal, Madine defected to the Rebel Alliance, though it cost him his fiancée, Karreio. After several complications in his defection, Madine became a valuable part of the Rebellion, advising and leading commando operations. He also planned the successful commando raid on the second Death Star's shield generator. After the Battle of Endor, Madine continued to serve in the New Republic. He was killed in action by Durga Besadii Tai after being captured on a mission to sabotage the Darksaber superweapon.
            Born on Corellia no later than 31 BBY,[2] Crix Madine attended the Raithal Academy and entered service in the Imperial Army. He rose quickly through the ranks after establishing himself as an innovative tactician and effective leader. He was engaged to a woman named Karreio. When the Imperial Military identified a need for a surgical strike force to counter the Alliance's guerrilla tactics, Madine was selected to form the unit. The result was the Storm commandos, which Madine hand picked from the stormtrooper ranks and trained himself. He led the unit on a number of missions, but found the missions he and his men were called on to perform were increasingly questionable.[4]
            He attempted to defect to the Alliance prior to the Battle of Yavin, and, to prove his loyalty, Madine provided essential guidance for the sabotage of Operation Strike Fear and the destruction of the Star Destroyer Invincible. However, it was the order to release the Candorian plague on Dentaal that convinced Madine it was time to leave for good.[4]
            Wracked with guilt over his role in the death of the entire Dentaalian population, Madine left his unit while performing a training mission about eleven months after the Battle of Yavin. Madine erased himself from Imperial records, although his disappearance was covered by some HoloNet news channels. He did not even tell his fiancée where he was going, not wanting to place her in a dangerous situation.[4]
            During this period, Madine provided clues to the Rebellion about the Dark trooper project; eventually he was captured by General Rom Mohc and imprisoned in Orinackra, where he awaited execution. Upon learning of his capture, Mon Mothma dispatched Kyle Katarn to rescue Madine, who revealed Mohc's role in the project. He also provided the Alliance with intelligence on two subsequent targets to sabotage the Dark Trooper project.
            After slipping back to his homeworld of Corellia, Madine's defection was intercepted once more by Imperial forces, but the timely arrival of Rogue Squadron allowed him to escape.[5]
            While some Alliance commanders were suspicious of Madine's Imperial past, he was allowed into the High Command Advisory Council with the backing of General Carlist Rieekan. His intimate knowledge of Imperial tactics earned him the position of Chief Military Advisor on the Advisory Council, and Supreme Commander of Alliance Special Forces. In the latter capacity, Madine trained Alliance ground commanders on tactics to use the Alliance's smaller numbers effectively against the Empire. Madine's Rules of War became the baseline standard operation procedure of Alliance SpecForces across the galaxy.[source?] Madine also led a Y-wing squadron named Gold Squadron against Imperial forces on Gerrard V. He also led the ground forces on strikes with Rogue Squadron, including raid on the Jade Moon and Battle of Kessel[5]
            Madine usually accompanied his subordinate in field missions (such as missions alongside Risiev Credal), which earned him the respect of many Rebel soldiers. The Task Force on Alliance Security, working alongside Madine in different missions, asked him to send a team of agents to recover designs by Imperial-aligned engineer Diran Miciluz. Madine also worked with the Task Force writing reports on threats to the Rebel Alliance, including the Granse Confederacy and Zayl Braith—Madine discovered that Braith was a fugitive of the Galactic Empire, and reported it to the Alliance.[6]
            In 3 ABY,[7] Madine led the ground forces in the Battle of Kothlis to recover the Razor from the wreckage of the Motivator. He also advised Rogue Squadron on many pivotal missions, including the Mission to Destrillion, and the Battle of Dubrillion, and the Fondor shipyard assault.[8]
            His unit of Alliance commandos sabotaged a number of critical Imperial shipments to slow construction on the second Death Star and was responsible for the capture of the Tydirium. The most important battle of the war, the Battle of Endor, might never have happened without Madine, in fact, as Mon Mothma was extremely hesitant about killing Emperor Palpatine, for she saw it as assassination, a tactic practiced only by criminals. Madine convinced her of the necessity of killing the Emperor, and when it came time to plan the Alliance's strike on the Death Star, Madine was chosen to coordinate the destruction of the Sanctuary Moon-based shield generator.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Crix_Madine/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCrixMadine</string></dict>

            When the Empire invaded Corellia, Benton Maas and the Czerka Corporation created a massive army of security droids to battle against Commander Jastal and his Imperial forces. However, their plan failed when an Imperial hero was able to disable two of CEC's signal towers. Benton Maas himself was protected by Czerka's best droid, C-9X, which was promised by Brall Tavar to be unbeatable. However, the droid was destroyed and its unique signal emitter it used to control other droids fell into the Imperial's hands. The rest of the board immediately became cowed but Benton defiantly dared the Imperial hero to turn CEC's own droids on him and his colleagues. The Imperial hero obliged, ordering the droids to kill the board but executed Benton personally.

Addicted to gambling on the outcomes of Podraces, he lost the majority of his belongings to the crime lord Gardulla the Hutt. M'rak remained in Mos Espa and took to smuggling weapons on the black market.
            Yade M'rak was a Human male from the planet Corellia.[1] Prior to 32 BBY,[3] he moved to the desert world of Tatooine and settled in the city of Mos Espa. Largely ignored and derided by the city's gangsters and spacers, M'rak made considerable efforts to stay out of their disputes and lightfights.[4]
            On Tatooine, M'rak was addicted to gambling on the outcome of Podraces. After losing most of his belongings to the crime lord Gardulla the Hutt, he remained in Mos Espa and worked as a smuggler of black market weaponry.[1] In 32 BBY, the Corellian attended the annual Boonta Eve Classic Podrace in the Mos Espa Grand Arena, where he watched the proceedings from the private viewing box of the Toydarian merchant Watto.[2]
            Yade M'rak was a gambling man who was addicted to betting on Podracing, but bad luck saw him part with the majority of his possessions.[1] He kept a low profile in Mos Espa and attempted not to become involved in local disputes.[4] Like many other down-on-their-luck denizens of the city, M'rak scraped by while dreaming of one day being able to leave Tatooine.[5] A smuggler of black market contraband and an able pilot, he was possessed of fair skin, as well as gray hair that he wore in at least two dreadlocks and sometimes kept under a hood.[1]
            Yade M'rak first appeared as an unnamed extra in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. He was played by an uncredited actor.[2] Information on the character was later revealed in 1999's Star Wars: Episode I The Visual Dictionary[4] and in the 2001 Coruscant Limited expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, the latter of which gave him a name.[1] The information from Coruscant Limited was later repeated in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yade_M%27rak</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascYadeM'rak</string></dict>
        <key>Rickard Lusoff</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.574.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rickard Lusoff was a Human male who lived on Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War. He planned to murder his business partner Calder Nettic for cheating him out of a business deal.
            Lusoff and Nettic ran a small surface-to-orbit transport business out of Garang Spaceport for Aratech for over twenty years prior to and during the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War. At some point Lusoff accused Nettic of cheating him in a business deal. Their quarrel reached such a violent level that Jedi Tooka was dispatched to the scene to restore order.
            By 3956 BBY Lusoff believed that Nettic had been cheating him out of credits from the profits of their business and attempted to kill him while the latter roamed the plains of Dantooine. He was too late, however, as Handon Guld had already committed the crime in retaliation for his wife having an affair with Nettic. Mistaking Guld for Nettic, Lusoff shot the other man who then activated his emergency signal beacon summoning the Jedi Bolook, who happened to be nearby. Though Bolook attempted to solve the case, he appeared to have some trouble.
            It was at this moment the amnesiac Revan and a pair of his companions arrived on the scene shortly thereafter just as the Twi'lek Jedi Knight was beginning his own investigation into the incident. After being invited make his own investigation, Revan conducted a series of interviews with Lusoff and Guld as well as with an information retrieval droid that Bolook had summoned from the Enclave.
            Lusoff tried to hide his guilt by claiming that he was out hunting iriaz. He claimed that when he saw one such animal he shot it, but when he went over to check he saw Guld standing over Nettic's body. However, Lusoff also claimed he couldn't see what he was doing too well because the sun was in his eyes. His lie began to fall apart when Revan confronted him with the fact that the sky was overcast at that time, and so there wouldn't have been any sun in his eyes.
            Revan proceeded to interview Lusoff about how well he knew Nettic. Lusoff grudgingly admitted his business history with Nettic but neglected to tell Revan about the cheating scandal. However, the information droid gave Revan this vital piece of the puzzle. Revan then asked Lusoff about the weapon that was found by Nettic's body. Lusoff said that Nettic kept an Echani light blaster rifle at his home, but also said that the blaster found at the body was not it, and that he had never seen it before. Following several more interviews with Guld, the droid, and Bolook, Revan surmised the true scenario: Guld had killed Nettic for sleeping with his wife and Lusoff had fired on Guld, who he mistook for Nettic, to avenge having been cheated in business. Lusoff and Guld were both taken into custody to be formally charged for their crimes. While Guld was charged with murder, Lusoff was charged with attempted murder as well as aggravated assault and attempted murder on Guld.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rickard_Lusoff</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRickardLusoff</string></dict>
        <key>M'Kae</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.575.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>M'Kae was a human male who served as an communications officer in the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He was stationed on board the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Avenger and served in the crew pit on the starship's bridge.
            In 3 ABY, the Avenger was a part of Death Squadron and was charged with destroying the rebel YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon as it attempted to escape from the rebel defeat at the Battle of Hoth. After the Falcon disappeared from the Avengers scanners, M'Kae informed Captain Lorth Needa, commander of the Avenger, that the Sith Lord Darth Vader wanted a report on their progress.
            The human male M'Kae[2] served as an communications officer[3] in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire and was stationed in the crew pit on the bridge of the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Avenger. During the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic in 3 ABY, the Avenger traveled to the planet Hoth as part of the Sith Lord Darth Vader's Death Squadron in order to destroy the rebel forces stationed in the Alliance's headquarters at Echo Base on the world.[1]
            The Empire successfully defeated the Alliance but could not prevent many of the enemy forces from fleeing. Under orders from Vader, the Avenger and several other Star Destroyers specifically pursued the rebel YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon. The Falcon evaded capture by hiding out in the Hoth asteroid field, but eventually left the cover of the asteroids to try and jump to hyperspace, encountering the Avenger as it did so.[1]
            After the Falcon's hyperdrive failed to function, the ship's captain Han Solo turned the vessel round and started flying directly toward the Avenger. The Star Destroyer's commander, Captain Lorth Needa, gave orders for the ship's shields to be raised, after which M'Kae flipped a switch on his console. The Falcon then flew in close past the bridge's viewport, causing the officer to look up from what he was doing while Needa and others closer to the viewport ducked for cover.[1]
            Needa immediately ordered that the Falcon be tracked, but was informed that it had disappeared from the Avenger's scanners.M'Kae then informed the captain that Lord Vader wanted an update on their progress in capturing the Falcon. Needa chose to report the failure to Vader in person, and was executed for his failure. The Falcon meanwhile had landed on the surface of the Avenger in order to escape its scanners, and was able to escape undetected by the Imperials, although not unnoticed by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.[1]
            M'Kae had fair skin and dark blond hair.[1]
            M'Kae wore a light gray Imperial uniform with a darker gray cap and a communications headset.[1]
            M'Kae was created for the 1980 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back[1] in which he was portrayed by Mark Capri.[2] The character was not identified in the film,[1] but refereed to as a "communications officer" in the script.[4] The character was first named in the current canon on a card in the 2019 Star Wars Black &amp; White: The Empire Strikes Back set of trading cards released by The Topps Company, Inc..[2]
            In the Star Wars Legends continuity, M'Kae appeared prior to the release of The Empire Strikes Back in the novelization of the film written by Donald F. Glut.[5] The character's name originated on a card in the Dagobah Limited expansion set of the Legends Star Wars Customizable Card Game in 1997.[6] According to a Star Wars CCG fan site, M'Kae was named as a tuckerization of Mark McKay, the stage name of radio personality Mark Tuttle.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/M%27kae</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascM'Kae</string></dict>

            A Force-sensitive Human, Lumas Etima was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order. Selected as a Padawan by Jedi Master Ekim Ryelli,[1] Etima constructed a blue-bladed lightsaber and continued to train with his master. Stationed at the Coruscant Jedi Temple around the time of the vote on the Military Creation Act in the Galactic Senate, Padawan Etima was one of two hundred Jedi to respond to Master Mace Windu's call to arms and joined the strike team dispatched to Geonosis to rescue fellow Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padmé Amidala from execution by the Confederacy of Independent Systems.[2]
            Landing on the planet, Etima and his peers stormed the Petranaki arena where they engaged in battle with the battle droids of the Separatist Droid Army. Despite his courage and ability with a lightsaber, Padawan Etima was overpowered by the sheer number of droids and died alongside countless numbers of his colleagues.[1]
            In Episode II, Lumas Etima was portrayed by stuntman Dean Gould.[4] There is a discrepancy between how he appears in the film and in the Hasbro box pack and Daily Calendar. In Attack of the Clones he can be seen going flying over a shattered piece of pillar and later on deflecting shots back at C-3PO, all the while wearing a dark tunic. The photo from Hasbro and the Calendar (which is not a still from the actual movie) shows him in light-colored clothing and wielding a lightsaber of a design unlike any of the "standard" types shared by the rest of the background Jedi.
            Leland Chee originally speculated that this character's fate was unknown.[5] He was later confirmed to have died at Geonosis by The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.
            An action figure of Lumas Etima was included in the Jedi Knight Army 3-pack from Hasbro along with an unidentified Twi'lek Jedi and Unidentified Rodian Jedi.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lumas_Etima</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLumasEtima</string></dict>

When training with his Master, he practiced against training drones on Alderaan, but he never saw action until the Clone Wars. One of Mak's skills was creating earth tremors using the Force, which he used to detonate the land mines on Jabiim, but this greatly weakened him and nearly caused him to pass out.

        <key>Kirtan Loor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.578.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kirtan Loor was an agent with Imperial Intelligence and former liaison officer to CorSec who played a large role in the events surrounding the capture of Coruscant by the New Republic. In time, Loor would prove to be one of Rogue Squadron's most persistent enemies. Loor resembled a much taller and younger Grand Moff Tarkin, and possessed an eidetic memory. Both of these traits made Loor very arrogant, making him feel superior to others.
            The earliest details of Kirtan Loor show that in 2 ABY[1] he became an Imperial liaison officer to CorSec. The officers he was assigned to were none other than Gil Bastra, Iella Wessiri, and Corran Horn. Loor was not interested in the internal affairs of CorSec, and even less in its officers. Loor also took great delight in complicating otherwise simple cases, even to the point of letting the killer of Horn's father go free.
            After enduring years of abuse under Loor, Bastra, Wessiri, and Horn hatched a plot to escape Loor. After they managed to escape right under his nose, Loor left his post as liaison officer, vowing to track down the three former CorSec officers and have his revenge.
            He almost caught up with Corran Horn on the planet of Garqi – Corran Horn was posing as Eamon Yzalli, aide to Prefect Mosh Barris as one of the aliases created by Gil Bastra. Horn was involved in a plot to free a Duros prisoner by the name of Lai Nootka who had some valuable spare parts for Horn's X-wing. Horn was able to frame Mosh Barris for his "murder" and Loor was sent to investigate. Horn and Loor missed each other by a matter of hours.
            Three months after events on Garqi, Loor managed to track down and capture Gil Bastra, though Bastra had insisted that he had let Loor catch him on purpose, to keep pursuit off his friends. Loor then attempted to interrogate Bastra, but when he put Bastra in a bacta tank to cure him of a fatal disease, he failed to realize that Bastra had an allergy to bacta. Bastra died in the interrogation attempt, leaving Loor back where he started. It was at that time he was recalled to Coruscant by Ysanne Isard.
            After his recall to Coruscant, Loor met Ysanne Isard, Director of Imperial Intelligence. Isard then recruited Loor and ordered him to track down and destroy Rogue Squadron. The reasons for why Loor was chosen are unknown, though it is suspected that Isard knew of his vendetta against Corran Horn, who at the time was a member of Rogue Squadron.
            Working with Admiral Devlia, Loor managed to track down Rogue Squadron to their base on Talasea. Fortunately for Rogue Squadron, Devlia was skeptical and mistrusted Loor's abilities. He only sent a single squad of stormtroopers, who were easily dispatched by Rogue Squadron, but one of the squadron's pilots, Lujayne Forge, was killed in the attack. When the New Republic retaliated and attacked Devlia's headquarters on Vladet, Loor made his escape. He was then ordered to go to Borleias, which was a vital stepping stone for the New Republic to reach Coruscant.
            After his arrival, Loor met with General Evir Derricote. Loor warned Derricote about the inevitable New Republic attack, and also spied on Derricote. After Derricote managed to repel the first New Republic assault, Isard ordered Loor to bring Derricote back to Coruscant with him.
            After the capture of Borleias by the New Republic, and the insertion of Rogue Squadron into Coruscant, Loor was again tasked with fighting off the legendary squadron, though this time, he was only supposed to delay them until Isard could unleash her lethal Krytos virus on the planet's nonhuman population and put pressure on the New Republic. To do this end, Loor enlisted the help of Zekka Thyne and Erisi Dlarit to spy on Rogue Squadron. Unfortunately for him, tough anti-espionage tactics employed by Wedge Antilles prevented him from stopping the New Republic's premature capture of Coruscant.
            As the New Republic closed in, Isard informed Loor that he was to lead the Palpatine Counter-Insurgency Front and perform guerrilla and terrorist attacks on the new government. While leading the PCF, Loor found himself working for Fliry Vorru, a former Corellian Moff. Vorru had Loor attack multiple targets, including a bacta storage facility and a school.
            Loor was not happy with any of this, and secretly plotted to overthrow Vorru and Isard. When he learned of a convoy that was going to deliver bacta to the New Republic, Loor took the chance. Using twelve X-wings he managed to obtain, Loor intended to steal the bacta for himself and blame the theft on Rogue Squadron. Unfortunately, Isard also knew of the convoy and tipped off Warlord Zsinj about it. Zsinj destroyed the entire convoy, including Loor's fake Rogue Squadron.
            With his plan in shambles, Loor was sure that Isard would discover his plans for betrayal. He sought sanctuary with the New Republic by offering to testify in Tycho Celchu's trial and divulging information about all Imperial activities on Coruscant. During his defection, he was codenamed "Behemoth." Loor never got the chance to reap the rewards of his defection, however. Isard received word of a secret witness attending Celchu's trial. Thinking it was General Derricote, Isard sent Diric Wessiri, a sleeper agent and Wessiri's husband, to prevent him from testifying.

As part of the Wraiths' first assignments, Loran participated in the Zsinj campaign, helping in the New Republic's effort to defeat Warlord Zsinj. He flourished in the Wraiths, using his skills and talents at acting. Loran's posing as Captain Zurel Darillian lured Admiral Apwar Trigit into a trap at Ession which led to the destruction of the Implacable. Later, Loran was called upon to adopt the persona of pirate General Kargin, the leader of the Hawk-bat Independent Space Force, in order to earn the confidence of Zsinj. Loran succeeded and the ruse led to the loss of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Razor's Kiss that Zsinj had attempted to abscond with. Based on his leadership and accomplishments, Loran eventually was promoted to captain and became the commander of the Wraiths after Antilles transferred back to Rogue Squadron. Also during this time he became romantically involved with fellow Wraith Dia Passik, whom he eventually married.
            When the New Republic Intelligence Service took over Wraith Squadron, Loran followed the unit over to Intelligence. He masterminded a plan to eliminate Imperial admiral Kosh Teradoc on Ryvester in 13 ABY, which also saw the rescue of gemologist Mulus Cheems. Loran served as commander of the Wraiths for many years, including through the entire Yuuzhan Vong War. He helped defend Borleias and infiltrate occupied Coruscant, along with Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade Skywalker, Tahiri Veila, and Danni Quee, the latter mission resulting in the successful elimination of the dangerous Dark Jedi Lord Nyax before the Dark Jedi could escape from the planet. Loran was present in the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar when the newly-reorganized Galactic Alliance retook the planet from the Yuuzhan Vong, ending the war.
            After the war, Loran continued to serve in Galactic Alliance intelligence, earning a promotion to general. During this time, he adopted his wife's daughter Adra Passik. After the Second Galactic Civil War, Loran was forced into retirement as part of a purge instituted by the newly-installed Daala regime. However, in 44 ABY, after Daala's replacement, Loran was called back by the head of Galactic Alliance Security, Borath Maddeus, and asked to investigate the chief of the Galactic Alliance Army, Stavin Thaal, who was suspected of possible involvement in a conspiracy to overthrow the Galactic Alliance. Loran put together two separate teams of Wraiths to accomplish this goal and assisted them as he could, though he kept his true activities hidden from Maddeus. As the isolated Wraith teams uncovered evidence implicating Thaal, Loran and his family were targeted by assassins. Loran and his family faked their deaths and the two Wraith teams were able to capture Thaal after exposing his plan to defect from the Galactic Alliance with a private army. Loran's findings also revealed that Maddeus was in league with Thaal, which led to Loran confronting and capturing Maddeus. He was then asked by Chief of State Wynn Dorvan to take over as head of Galactic Alliance Security, which he accepted, while also maintaining the secret existence of the revived Wraith Squadron.
            A Pantolomin native of Lorrdian heritage, as a child Loran made thinly-veiled Imperial propaganda holodramas such as The Black Bantha, Jungle Flutes, and Win or Die—becoming in many ways the galaxywide poster child for Imperial recruitment. Sometime in his childhood acting career, Loran acquired the moniker "Face" for his comely appearance and it stuck with him the rest of his life. Kidnapped by an extremist cell that had been kicked out of the Rebel Alliance, his face was scarred when Imperial stormtroopers massacred his kidnappers in a rescue attempt. However, before his captors were killed, they gave him a thorough briefing in the atrocities committed by the Empire and Imperial Intelligence as a precursor to his planned execution. Loran used this occasion to disappear, leaving his fans to believe that he had died in the fight. His supposed death was used by the Empire to sully the image of the New Republic by blaming them for his death. Loran did decide to leave the scar, though, seeing it as a reminder of how much he had helped the Imperial cause.[3] After the encounter, Loran quietly returned to his home on Pantolomin, where his parents later sent him to Lorrd, their homeworld, while publicly maintaining the death of the famous holostar.[1]
            As a youth on Lorrd, he took the alias of Kal zet Berri and was taken in by the governor of Lorrd, Zenobia le Ingiana, as a favor to Loran's parents. He attended the Sebs Jemas Flight School in Lorrd City and was already considering joining the Rebel Alliance. During his stay on Lorrd, he occasionally visited a starship dealership in the city of Qatamer, Hart and Parn Starships, as he was interested in starfighters. On one such visit, Loran climbed into an R-22 Spearhead starfighter and played a trick on a pair of nearby children about his age, Zak and Tash Arranda, by activating the starfighter's targeting system, scaring them. He then climbed out of the starfighter and introduced himself to them, though shortly thereafter, the three were escorted from the premises due to Loran's shenanigans. As it turned out, the Arrandas were staying with the governor as well, so the three youths were able to spend time together. Later, Loran showed the two Arrandas around Qatamer, pointing out sights and locations of interest. He also helped them play a joke on their uncle Mammon Hoole by imitating Tash's voice.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Garik_Loran</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGarikLoran</string></dict>
        <key>Longshot</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.580.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"Longshot" was the nickname of a clone trooper who served the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars with the 212th Battalion.
            Longshot was one of the many clones created on Kamino.[1][3] He was a soldier in the 212th Attack Battalion.[3]
            When separatist forces captured Jedi Master Even Piell and imprisoned him in the Citadel, a prison on the planet Lola Sayu the Republic mounted a rescue. Longshot was one of the clones assigned to the rescue team under Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to infiltrate the prison. The group was frozen in carbonite and used reprogrammed droids and a stolen separatist shuttle to get them on Lola Sayu without being detected by the life-form scanners.[3]
            Once the group was unfrozen, they free-climbed a wall covered with electro mines to sneak into the Citadel via a small entrance. Unfortunately, a fellow trooper hit one of the mines, which alerted the warden of their presence, who proceeded to activate the facility's security protocols. Inside the facility the group took out some laser turrets and surveillance. This activated an electric field that moved across the hall towards the group. While the other team members quickly managed to take cover in the side halls, Longshot was caught by the field, which dragged him along before dropping him, electrocuting and killing him.[3]
            As a clone of Jango Fett Longshot stood at 1.83 meters.
            Longshot utilized white Phase I clone trooper armor and a standard DC-15A blaster.
            In the episode, Longshot was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who voices all clone troopers through the series.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Longshot</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLongshot</string></dict>

        <key>Daegen Lok</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.582.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Daegen Lok was a male Human from the Tython system who was a member of the Je'daii Order, having been trained by Je'daii Master Quan-Jang. When the Despot War erupted in the year 25,805 BBY with the Despot Queen Hadiya's attempts to conquer the Tython system, Lok went undercover in Hadiya's Despot Army and became one of Hadiya's generals, not to mention her lover. Lok ultimately killed Hadiya, ending the war, and he was promoted to the rank of Master in 25,800 BBY. Overconfident in his abilities, Lok ventured into the Chasm, a rent in the surface of the planet Tython that drove mad all who dove too deep into its depths. There, Lok witnessed a vision of an army of dark warriors wielding blades of fire, and the vision drove the Je'daii mad, driving him to the dark side of the Force. The Je'daii Council refused to believe Lok's vision and banished him to the moon of Bogan, but the mad Je'daii held onto his vision, gathering his power in the dark side of the Force for the next seven years.
            In 25,793 BBY, Lok received a vision of the dark warrior who led the army in his vision in the Chasm, and the young man—Xesh—arrived on Bogan as an exile only days later. Upon learning of Xesh's knowledge of the blades of fire, which he called Forcesabers, Lok recruited Xesh in his quest to create more of the weapons and thereby prove his vision to the Council. The two escaped Tython in a hidden starfighter in order to craft Forcesabers, pursued all the while by the Je'daii, who battled the two fugitives several times before a final encounter on the planet Shikaakwa. Lok's dreams of conquest were ended when Xesh was convinced to turn on the mad Je'daii, and Lok was imprisoned once more on Bogan as the Je'daii began to prepare for war with the Rakata Infinite Empire. However, as the Empire gained more ground, Lok was freed from Bogan and allowed to lead the Je'daii as a general.
            A Force-sensitive Human male, Daegen Lok was born in the Tython system and trained as a member of the Je'daii Order[1] by Quan-Jang, the Temple Master of Anil Kesh—the Je'daii Temple of Science on the planet Tython.[3] During his time as a Je'daii, Lok had an adventure on the planet Sunspot, the closest planet to the star Tythos in the system, and while there he rescued the alien Slug.[4] Lok became friends with Hawk Ryo, a Twi'lek Je'daii from the planet Shikaakwa, and the two had become Je'daii Rangers before the year 25,805 BBY, when the Despot War erupted: a conflict between the Je'daii Order and the Despot Army under the rule of the Despot Queen Hadiya. After uniting the crime barons of Shikaakwa, Hadiya began to try and conquer the Tython system. Lok was approached by Volnos Ryo, Hawk's brother and the middle son of the baron of Clan Ryo on Shikaakwa, who offered to help Lok infiltrate the Despot Army to gain revenge against Hadiya for her killing his father and older brother.[2]
            Posing as a disgraced Ranger with Ryo's support, Lok joined the Despot Army and rose through the ranks, earning a place as one of Hadiya's generals and even becoming the queen's lover. Lok himself developed feelings for Hadiya, and the line between his deception and his true mission began to blur until Volnos Ryo contacted him and reminded him of his purpose. At that time, the Despot Army on Tython itself, laying siege to the Kaleth, the Temple of Knowledge, and Lok slept in Hadiya's tent with the queen. That night, as Hadiya was sleeping, Lok stabbed her with a dagger through a slit in her armor. However, his hesitation—assassination was forbidden among the Je'daii, and Lok's feelings for Hadiya were also a factor—led Lok's strike to not be fatal, and Hadiya grabbed a dagger of her own and sliced Lok's face across his right eye. Enraged, Lok drew his sword and slew Hadiya, and he then proceeded to slaughter his way out of the command camp, leaving only one survivor.[2] Without Hadiya's leadership, Hadiya's generals fought for power amongst each other, and the Je'daii soon defeated the remnants of the Despot Army.[5]
            Around the year 25,800 BBY, Lok was promoted to the rank of Je'daii Master, and he soon decided to explore the Chasm, a planetary rift below the Temple of Science Anil Kesh, with Hawk Ryo. Brash and overconfident in his power, Lok ignored the fact that the Chasm messed with the minds of any who entered, and he ignored Ryo's cautions against heading deeper into the Chasm. However, as Lok gazed deeper into the darkness, both he and Ryo were overcome by a Force vision[6] of an army of dark warriors wielding blades of frozen fire marching across Ska Gora,[7] led by a being with one red eye.[6] In Lok's vision, he led the Je'daii against them.[2]
            The vision drove Lok insane, driving him into the dark side of the Force, and Ryo pushed aside his vision to pull the two of them up out of the Chasm. When questioned by the Je'daii Council, Lok told them of his vision and warned them of the coming danger. However, the Council did not believe Lok's vision, and as Lok continued to wallow in the dark side, using the Force to manipulate the minds of others. As a result, both Lok and Ryo were exiled to the moon of Bogan, where the two were ordered to meditate on the Force and restore their inner balance. Ryo came to deny his vision and found balance once more, but Lok refused to forsake his vision and the dark side. Over the next seven years, Lok figured out how to remove the cuffs that kept prisoners separate, and he also discovered a crashed Pho-V fighter that had escaped the Je'daii's notice. In his madness, Lok carved an enormous carving of himself wielding the blade of fire, and numerous pictures of the weapon.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Daegen_Lok</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDaegenLok</string></dict>
        <key>Lobot</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.583.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lobot, also known by the nickname Lo, was a male human from the planet Bespin who, with the assistance of his AJ^6 cyborg construct, was paid to run battlefield calculations for the Galactic Empire. However, he eventually began working with the smuggler Lando Calrissian aboard the Millennium Falcon, running numerous criminal jobs. During one job, the theft of the Emperor's personal yacht, Lobot was gravely wounded by an Imperial Guard. In his injured state, Lobot's mind was lost and his cybernetic implants took over.
            In the time to come, Calrissian became Baron Administrator of Cloud City on Lobot's homeworld of Bespin, and Lobot served as his aide and chef. As the city's computer-liaison officer, his implants enabled him to communicate with the city's central network. During the Empire's takeover of Cloud City, Lando ordered Lobot to gather their security forces to outflank the stormtroopers. Although they successfully helped evacuate the city by rounding up the stormtroopers, the city soon fell to the Empire and Lobot was captured.
            Following the Empire's defeat at the Battle of Endor, Imperial Governor Ubrik Adelhard tightened his grip on the Anoat sector, home to Bespin, forming the Iron Blockade. Receiving support from the New Republic, Lobot fought to liberate his homeworld.
            During the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and Alliance to Restore the Republic, Lobot, a male human from Bespin,[1] was hired by the Empire to run battlefield calculations. In order to do so, he allowed the Imperials to implant an AJ^6 cyborg construct[4] to his brain, exchanging some of his personality for increased productivity.[7] Eventually leaving the Empire, Lobot formed a friendship with the smuggler Lando Calrissian, owner of the Millennium Falcon,[8] and Chanath Cha, a bounty hunter. They remained friends for years, and Lobot and Cha fell in love.[9] Nonetheless, Calrissian and Cha went separate ways, and Lobot chose to remain with Lando.[5] At some point during their underground operations, Lando lost the Millennium Falcon to another old friend of his, Han Solo, in a game of sabacc.[10]
            Some time after the Battle of Yavin, Lobot and Calrissian found themselves in deep debt to Papa Toren, a crime boss who operated off of the Imperial world Castell in the Colonies region of the galaxy. Calrissian, in order to pay off the debt, went to steal a valuable object from the Imperial governor of the sector: Moff Ssaria, known as the "Fiend of Castell" and the "Burning Moff." However, instead of just stealing the trinket and running, Calrissian suavely manipulated the Moff into giving it to him; Calrissian soon told the story to Lobot when they met in Toren's cantina. Lobot was shocked at the risks his partner took, adding that his implants gleaned that the odds of that working were about one in ten-thousand. The gambler replied that he didn't like to know the odds, and explained that he had done what he did because he didn't want the Moff hunting them. Lobot was assured by his partner that they were debt free after he traded the trinket to Toren, and Lando then went to speak with the crime boss. He returned a few minutes later with news: ten percent of their debt had been wiped away, and he had a chance at one "hell of a score." Lobot was appalled that only ten percent of their debt had been cleared and demanded to know what had gone wrong. Calrissian explained that things had not gone as planned, but still had gone well, given the new job. Lobot, however, did not share Calrissian's optimism and believed they should fight Toren. Calrissian did not, adding that Lobot had the cyborg construct implanted so he wouldn't have to fight; just analyze battlefront movements from afar. Lobot gave in, so they began preparations for the job.[5]
            The duo first recruited the cloned hand-to-hand combat experts Aleksin and Pavol in case they did need to fight, and next, the Ugnaught antiquities expert, Sava Korin Pers, who they met in her office. Pers pulled a blaster on Calrissian when he entered; the last time they had worked together, Pers lost an eye. Pers eventually accepted to assist in the job after seeing the ease and the payoff. Soon, the team of five made their way to Sienar Fleet Systems Orbital Shipyard CC-24 in orbit over Castell, which the team infiltrated using stealth suits. They quickly secured a portion of the shipyard, hijacked an Imperial pleasure craft that they believed had belonged to an Imperial art collector, and blasted away from the station. Calrissian piloted the ship, the Imperialis, while Lobot acted as his co-pilot. Lobot was unsure of Calrissian's rejoicing in escaping so easily; Lobot believed there was still trouble to come.[5]
            Lobot was soon proven correct when a trio of Imperial-class Star Destroyers emerged from hypersapce near the Imperialis. Lobot grew frustrated as the "easy score" that Calrissian had promised began to disappear. Calrissian argued that it was a good thing that the Star Destroyers arrived; it meant the ship was incredibly valuable to its owner—who, unknown to Lobot and his fellows, was none other than Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine. The Star Destroyers dropped gravity-based mines to prevent the Imperialis from entering hyperspace, but the yacht's automated defenses destroyed the mines. When the Star Destroyers captained by Shan and Conro activated tractor beams to reclaim the vessel, Lando had Lobot upload the ships' coordinates to Lando's piloting computer. With the coordinates uploaded, Lando piloted the Imperialis between the two Star Destroyers, causing them to lock onto each other. Unable to disengage in time, the capital ships collided, giving the Imperialis the opportunity to jump to hyperspace. Free from the Castell system, Lando and Lobot were approached by Sava Korin, who said the yacht was filled with treasure. Touring the crew around, Korin explained that one area of the ship, the central chamber, was very well secured, so Lobot volunteered to open the sealed door with his implants. When he did, however, he was confronted by a pair of Imperial Guards, one of which immediately impaled him through the chest with their staff.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lobot</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLobot</string></dict>
        <key>Llaban</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.584.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Llaban was a Human male native of Kirrek, and leader of the rebel forces that fought against Empress Teta's military in the Unification Wars of the Koros system. Llaban's forces clashed with the Tetan military in 5000 BBY in the confrontation on Kirrek, and although the rebels were able to besiege the Tetans for over a month, Teta eventually seized victory due to the efforts of Jedi Knights Odan-Urr and Memit Nadill. Later that same year, after the outbreak of the Great Hyperspace War, Llaban was appointed by Teta, due to his desire for amnesty and his effort in the Unification Wars, to lead the fight against the Sith Empire on Kirrek. Although chances of winning against the large Sith force seemed long at first, Llaban and his army fought with resounding success and won the second battle at Kirrek.
            Llaban was a Human male native of the Koros system planet of Kirrek. In 5000 BBY, the political leader known as Empress Teta launched a campaign to unify the seven worlds of the Koros system. Llaban, not wanting Teta's dreams of Koros system unity to become a reality, led a makeshift army of rebels and pirates in opposition of Teta's forces on Kirrek.[1] In the Battle of Kirrek, the concluding battle in the Koros Unification Wars, Llaban's rebels encircled and besieged Teta's forces in a citadel. The siege lasted a month, until the beleaguered Tetan soldiers received assistance from Jedi Knights Memit Nadill and Odan-Urr, who used the Force power of battle meditation to raise the spirits of the Tetan forces and lower the morale of Llaban's rebels. Although a desperate call for turret fire downed several Tetan supply ships, Llaban and his rebels were defeated in the Battle of Kirrek.[2]
            Later that same year, forces led by Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow, ruler of the long-isolated Sith Empire, invaded the Galactic Republic. The Great Hyperspace War, as it came to be known, was fought on two fronts; one at the Republic capital of Coruscant and the other in the Koros system. With the battle for the Koros system about to begin, Llaban went to Empress Teta's palace in the city of Cinnagar on Koros Major and asked her if he and his rebels could fight against the Sith in order to gain amnesty for their involvement in the rebellion. Although one of Teta's top advisors and generals, Vontaige, was strongly opposed to this, Teta placed Llaban in charge of the defense of Kirrek. Also, Teta promised to recall prisoners of war exiled to Ronika to aid Llaban in Kirrek's defense. Alongside Jedi Knight Odan-Urr and Jedi Master Ooroo, Llaban rounded up his old army of rebels and prepared them for battle with the Sith, reinforcing their positions with sharpened wooden stakes and trenches. The large Sith fleet appeared in the sky and launched dropships containing troops to the surface. The Battle of Kirrek had begun.[1]
            Although Llaban and his army fought hard against the Sith, the sheer size of the enemy force, which featured dozens of large Sith war behemoths, seemed too overwhelming. Despite Odan-Urr's battle meditation, the Sith Massassi warriors were able to break through their lines. With the Massassi pushing forward, Llaban ordered his soldiers to retreat. However, Ooroo at last entered the fray; a Celegian, Ooroo lived in a container filled with the cyanogen gas that he breathed. As the cyanogen gas was poisonous to oxygen breathers, Ooroo poked several holes in his container, letting the winds blow the gas toward the Sith. This strategy was initially successful, but more invaders kept coming. Finally, ships carrying the reinforcements from Ronika arrived and gave Llaban and his army new hope for victory. The combination of the soldiers from Ronika and Ooroo's cyanogen gas spelled doom for the Sith, and the Battle of Kirrek was won.[3]
            Although Llaban fought against Empress Teta in the Unification Wars, he was able to swallow his pride and appeal to her before the outbreak of the Great Hyperspace War. He was a capable leader, as shown by his gathering of a rebel army on Kirrek and his subsequent leading of that force with great success in both the Unification Wars and the Great Hyperspace War. Llaban willingly served Teta even after his defeat in the Unification Wars and was shocked and grateful for Teta's granting of prisoners from Ronika to bolster his forces. In battle, Llaban wore orange war paint on his face.[1]
            Llaban first appeared in Tales of the Jedi: The Fall of the Sith Empire, a story arc of the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Kevin J. Anderson and released in 1997. He made appearances in the third and fourth issues of The Fall of the Sith Empire. In these appearances Llaban was illustrated by Dario Carrasco, Jr.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Llaban</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLlaban</string></dict>

        <key>Yogar Lyste</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.586.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lieutenant Yogar Lyste, operating number: LSM-03, was an officer of the Galactic Empire several years prior to the Battle of Yavin. He was stationed on the planet Lothal, where he served as Imperial Supply Master of Capital City; keeping track of all weapons and gear shipped in, as well as any produced locally. In 3 BBY, Lyste was placed in charge of a military depot and hosted a relief mission led by Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. The theft of three Sphyrna-class corvettes by the Spectres caused him considerable embarrassment.
            Eventually, Lyste was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and made acting captain of an Imperial light cruiser. With his new position, he was responsible for monitoring who and what entered the star system, specifically aimed at defending the planets from rebels. In 2 BBY, Lieutenant Lyste came under the command of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who took an interest in the rebel insurgency in the Lothal sector. During the course of Thrawn's investigation into the identity of the rebel agent Fulcrum, Lyste was framed by his colleague, the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus.
            Born on Garel, Yogar Lyste eventually joined the Imperial Military, where at least five years before the Battle of Yavin he would hold the position of Supply Master on the Outer Rim agricultural backwater of Lothal. An ambitious young Imperial officer, Lyste was charged with overseeing the planet's imports and exports, as well as regulating, maintaining, and distributing products from local Imperial-controlled industries. This also included the transport of prisoners.[4]
            Throughout his career, Lyste was harassed by a group of rebels known by the locals as the Spectres, with each attack infuriating him to further his efforts.[4] Shortly before the orphan Ezra Bridger joined the rebel cell, Lyste was overseeing the transference of several crates of food and blasters to the Imperial Complex on Lothal when the shipment was hijacked by the crew of the Ghost. Lyste and the stormtroopers under his command attempted to stop the theft of the cargo, but were powerless to prevent the rebels from fleeing on speeder bikes with the crates.[5]
            Some time later, Lyste was in the town of Kothal, where he attempted to pressure local farmer Morad Sumar into selling his farmland to the Empire. After Sumar expressed disinterest in the prospect, Lyste took his troops to the farm later that day, where he forcibly evicted Sumar, his wife and their Aqualish farmhand, destroying their home with his troop transport's cannons. The farmer, his wife and the farmhand were later freed while in transit by Ezra Bridger and Garazeb Orrelios, who had seen the smoking ruins of the farm from the TIE/ln space superiority starfighter they had recently stolen.[6]
            Sometime later, Lyste investigated a report by the Imperial cadet Nazhros Oleg that a warehouse in Lothal's Capital City was taking in barrels of ebla beer without the proper tax stamps. His agents verified that the barrels were being stockpiled in a warehouse for distribution, resulting in Captain Piers Roddance ordering a raid, headed by Oleg, with Zare Leonis and a squad of stormtroopers providing backup.[7]
            In the aftermath of the Siege of Lothal, a large number of Imperial troops withdrew from Lothal, resulting in Lyste receiving more responsibility, serving as a port commander.[8] Becoming a lieutenant and acting as captain aboard a light cruiser,[9] he became responsible for monitoring ships going to and from the planet, along with ensuring that no dissident forces returned to disrupt Imperial rule. Unknown to Lyste, the same group of rebels that ignited the insurgency on Lothal had secretly returned, slipping past his notice and landing on the planet, in order to rendezvous with the Alderaanian dignitary Princess Leia Organa, of whom Lyste was skeptical of due to rebel activity and a history of Alderaanian vessels being "stolen" by rebels. Hoping to avoid such an incident, he implemented as much security as possible by dispatching a stormtrooper detachment and using gravity locks to secure Organa's three Sphyrna-class corvettes.[10]
            As an added security measure, Lyste also brought in two All Terrain Armored Transports to patrol the area. After Organa insisted that Lyste temporarily hand over his own transport for a relief mission, she, along with Kanan Jarrus and Bridger, both disguised as Imperial soldiers, staged a kidnapping of the princess. After falling for the ruse, Lyste immediately ordered a scan of the nearby area to find the rebels that Organa was secretly working with. Hoping to seize Organa's vessels for the rebellion, the rebels launched a raid on Lyste's garrison the following evening, in which they managed to "steal" the Hammerheads. Going along with the rebels' plan, Organa threatened to blackmail Lyste for his inept command of the helpless Imperial presence on Lothal unless she was compensated, and he quickly agreed to do so without any hesitation. After securing a transport for her, he discovered that his own private transport was missing.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yogar_Lyste</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascYogarLyste</string></dict>

He accompanied the gang's leader, Tasu Leech, and several other members in boarding the Baleen-class heavy freighter Eravana in order to reclaim 50,000 credits owed to the Kanjiklub  by the vessel's owner, the smuggler Han Solo.
            Volzang Li-Thrull was born in the planet Nar Kanji.[1] Later on his life, he became a member of Tasu Leech's criminal gang Kanjiklub around thirty years following the Battle of Endor. At some point of his life, the Corellian smuggler Han Solo got into debt with Kanjklub, owing them 50,000 credits.[2]
            In 34 ABY, Li-Thrull accompanied Leech and the other Kanjiklub members to Solo's vessel the Baleen-class heavy freighter Eravana to reclaim the 50,000 credits that Solo owed them. The Kanjiklub arrived in the freighter's airlock shortly after their rivals, the Guavian Death Gang, who Solo also owed money, and the smuggler found himself trapped between the two groups. As Leech and Bala-Tik, frontman for the Death Squad, argued with Solo, the scavenger Rey and the former First Order stormtrooper Finn, who Solo had recently brought aboard, accidentally released three rathtars that were being kept on the ship. The creatures immediately attacked the two criminal groups, and in the ensuing chaos, Li-Thrull was eaten by the rathtars along with several of his comrades while Solo and his companions managed to escape the creatures on board the Millennium Falcon.[2]

        <key>Zare Leonis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.590.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zare Leonis was a male human Imperial cadet at the Academy for Young Imperials on the planet Lothal who worked as a spy for the rebels. Born to Leo and Tepha Leonis on the planet Uquine, Leonis and his family traveled as part of their work for the Empire before settling on Lothal. Leonis joined the planet's Imperial Academy to discover the truth about what happened to his sister, Dhara, who had vanished from the Academy.
            Leonis began his schooling on Lothal at the Junior Academy of Applied Sciences, in which he played as the center striker of the school's grav-ball team, the AppSci SaberCats. During this time, he led the team to a winning season, but also had to contend with the xenophobia of the school's athletic director, Janus Fhurek. He also began to learn of the Empire's activities on Lothal and how his friend and grav-ball teammate, Beck Ollet, tried to rebel against them. It was also during his time at the Junior Academy that he learned of his sister's disappearance, resulting in his decision to enroll in the Imperial Academy.
            At the Academy, he struggled to present himself as a model Imperial cadet. Secretly, he aided rebel activities and searched for any information that could aid his search for his sister, assisted on the outside by his girlfriend, Merei Spanjaf. During his time at the Academy, Leonis walked a fine line, appearing on the outside to be doing everything he could to serve the Empire, but struggling for any scrap of information that would lead him closer to his goal. His activities drew the attention of the Galactic Emperor's fierce Jedi hunter servant, the Grand Inquisitor, but he also picked up a mentor in the form of the instructor Lieutenant Chiron, an instructor at the Academy with a sympathetic nature.
            Leonis's activities ultimately earned him a transfer to the Imperial Academy on the planet Arkanis. It was there that Leonis's sister was being held; however, his mission took an unexpected turn as he learned of the presence of a secret society within the academy, the Commandant's Cadets. Founded by the Academy's Commandant, Brendol Hux, the goal of this group was raise Imperial officers hyper-loyal to the Galactic Empire from an early age. Leonis made it his mission to infiltrate this society and ultimately succeeded, but his true nature was betrayed by his old friend and teammate Beck Ollet, who had been captured and brainwashed by the Empire. He underwent a sham tribunal and was sentenced to death, but a last meal offered to him by Chiron provided him with a chance to escape. After reversing the Empire's brainwashing of Ollet, the two, with the help of Spanjaf, his family and friends, and the group of rebels from Lothal known to him as "the Spectres," Leonis succeeding in rescuing his sister and escaping the grip of the Empire.
            Zare Leonis was born on the planet Uquine of the Colonies region of the galaxy[1] in 3258 LY or 19 BBY,[2][3] around the inception of the Galactic Empire, to agricultural scientists Leo and Tepha Leonis. He was raised along with his elder sister Dhara by his parents and the family nanny droid Auntie Nags. The Leonises moved around a lot due to the nature of their parent's occupation, and he spent most of his childhood living aboard space stations, such as Hosk Station. During his childhood, Leonis and his family would live on several worlds including Moorja and Viamarr. The Leonis family was sympathetic to the Empire, seeing it as a great improvement over the slow bureaucracy of the Republic and the corruption of the Trade Federation.[2]
            At the age of fourteen years, Leonis and his family immigrated to Lothal, a backwater planet in the Outer Rim Territories. His parents found work at the Ministry of Agriculture's Lothal branch and settled down into an apartment in Lothal's Capital City. His sister Dhara, who was a year older than him, enrolled at the Imperial Academy on Lothal. A month after his family's relocation to Lothal, Leonis attended a function organized by his parents to celebrate his sister's acceptance into the Imperial Academy. During the function, Leonis socialized with a few Imperial officials, including Lieutenant Piers Roddance, Ames Bunkle, and Governor Arihnda Pryce, who extolled the purported progress of the Galactic Empire. Near the end of the function, Zare and Dhara promised to keep in touch while she was training at the Academy.[2]
            Since Leonis was too young to enroll at the Imperial Academy, he became a student at the Junior Academy of Applied Sciences during Lothal's autumn season. He also joined the school's grav-ball team, the AppSci SaberCats, and became the team's center striker. Leonis and his team were coached by the Duros Coach Ramset, who was known for his conservative methods. During his time with the SaberCats, Leonis also befriended the team's kicker Merei Spanjaf, a teenage Corulag girl who became his girlfriend and the team's fullback Beck Ollet, a Lothal human boy who was the son of jogan fruit farmers. While Leonis excelled in grav-ball, he found agricultural science boring and loathed his Current Events class. His Current Events teacher Tralls used the class as a platform to disseminate Imperial propaganda. When Leonis questioned the official Imperial account of the Trade Federation's crop engineering program on Chrona, which contradicted his parent's recollections, Mister Tralls chided the youth for stepping out of the Imperial party line.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zare_Leonis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZareLeonis</string></dict>
        <key>Bevel Lemelisk</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.591.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bevel Lemelisk was an engineer and architect who designed, among other things, six superweapons with the power to destroy a planet: the Death Star prototype, the Death Star, the second Death Star, the Eclipse, the Tarkin, and the Darksaber. Starting his career by working for the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, Lemelisk studied under Nasdra Magrody, and worked alongside such illustrious designers as Doctor Walex Blissex. He aided Blissex in designing the Victory I-class Star Destroyer, which would remain a staple in military flotillas decades after its initial creation. When the Galactic Empire rose to power in 19 BBY, Lemelisk was tasked by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin with the development of the Death Star battlestation, which would have the power to destroy entire worlds.
            The Death Star's development and subsequent construction ensued for years, with Lemelisk working at the Maw Installation alongside designers including Frap Radicon and Umak Leth. When the station was finally completed, it was destroyed by the Alliance to Restore the Republic at the Battle of Yavin. Furious at the fact that the Alliance had been able to locate and exploit a fatal flaw in the design, Emperor Palpatine had Lemelisk executed, and subsequently resurrected in a clone body. Palpatine ordered Lemelisk to design a new Death Star, one that did not possess the same fatal flaw as the original. During development, the Emperor executed and resurrected Lemelisk a further six times.
            Though he succeeded in eliminating the original flaw, the Alliance once again destroyed his creation while it was under construction at Endor. Palpatine died his first death there, effectively allowing Lemelisk to avoid yet another execution. After a brief stint designing the Eclipse, news of Palpatine's return reached the architect, prompting him to flee. He found work in the employ of the Hutt crime lord Durga Besadii Tai, who tasked him with the creation of the Darksaber superweapon. Though his designs were more efficient than they had ever been, inferior workmanship and materials doomed Durga's weapon before it had even had a chance to be used. Per Lemelisk's predictions, the weapon failed and was destroyed, with Lemelisk himself captured by the New Republic. Four years later, he became one of the few people executed by the Republic for genocide.
            Bevel Lemelisk was a Human male who was born during the latter years of the Galactic Republic,[1] and at some stage in his early life, Lemelisk was instructed by the esteemed engineer Professor Nasdra Magrody of the Magrody Institute of Programmable Intelligence.[4] Amongst his classmates was the scientist Doctor Tolum Harous,[5] and Lemelisk ultimately embarked upon a career as both an engineer and an architect.[1] At some point, Lemelisk worked with the Geonosians, an insectoid species from the planet Geonosis, to assist in the production of their attack craft,[6] and he eventually became involved in the development of the Death Star, a project for which he would become best known. The concept of the Death Star, a battlestation with the power to destroy entire worlds,[1] was first conceived by the starfighter designer Raith Sienar as the "Expeditionary Battle Planetoid," and steps to bring Sienar's vision into a realty were first taken[7] in 29 BBY,[8] when Wilhuff Tarkin, commander of the Republic Outland Regions Security Force, promoted the idea to the leader of the Republic, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.[7] Having expressed a strong interest in the project, Palpatine appointed Lemelisk to pursue advances in hypermatter science that would be required in order to construct such a gigantic space station.[9]
            Over the next few years, progress was made on developing the initial Death Star concept. As architectural planning for the station commenced, Lemelisk ventured to Geonosis, were he worked alongside the Geonosians to resolve some remaining power-supply and structural concerns that plagued the design. As Lemelisk refined the plans for the station, he made several significant departures from Raith Sienar's intial vision, and he placed the Death Star's hangars in orientation with station's gravity systems, rather than at various angles along the station's surface as Sienar had planned.[9] After the outbreak of the Clone Wars, a large-scale conflict between the Republic and the breakaway Confederacy of Independent Systems, Lemelisk began working directly for the Republic. In his new role, he aided the starship engineer Walex Blissex in the development of the Victory I-class Star Destroyer[1] and also produced various other weapons of war for the Republic Military.[10] Before the Clone Wars, Lemelisk had been forced to curb his appetite for destruction, and had kept his ideas for weapons of terror to himself. While working with Blissex, however, his ideas came to the fore to a minor degree, although he was still forced to keep quiet about what he truly dreamed of. When the Republic became the Galactic Empire following the Declaration of a New Order in 19 BBY, Lemelisk was finally given an opportunity to put his ideas into practice, devising a wide array of vastly destructive weapons.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bevel_Lemelisk</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBevelLemelisk</string></dict>

        <key>Owen Lars</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.594.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Owen Lars was the son of moisture farmer Cliegg Lars and the stepbrother of Anakin Skywalker. He married Beru Whitesun, and after his father's death, inherited his moisture farm. In 19 BBY, Beru convinced Owen to adopt Anakin's son, Luke Skywalker, as Anakin had turned to the dark side and become the infamous Darth Vader.
            Owen and Beru raised their nephew as well as they could, and Owen instilled into Luke the values of his own childhood. Fearful of Luke's potential, and distrustful of the outside galaxy, Owen attempted to keep Luke isolated and ignorant of his true parentage.
            Owen was born on the Core World Ator, the homeworld of his birth mother, Aika Lars. Aika died when Owen was very young, so he and his father returned to his father's homeworld of Tatooine. Owen lived with his father Cliegg on their moisture farm. He helped his father buy Shmi Skywalker from Watto. Shortly after freeing her and her son Anakin's protocol droid, C-3PO, Shmi and Cliegg married, making her Owen's stepmother. Shmi often told her new family how much she missed her son Anakin, who had been freed by a Jedi to join the Jedi Order years before.
            Over the next few years, Owen met a beautiful girl named Beru Whitesun, and the two fell in love. Beru moved in with Owen and his family and they lived contentedly together. However, tragedy would soon strike when Shmi was kidnapped by Tusken Raiders about a month before the start of the Clone Wars. Organizing a group of thirty other local settlers, Owen and Cliegg set out to find Shmi; however, their attempt was inherently doomed as the Tuskens set a trap. Only four of the settlers made it through, and Cliegg lost one of his legs. Owen built a hover chair for his father to maneuver following this injury.
            One month after Shmi's kidnapping, her Jedi son (now Owen's stepbrother), Anakin Skywalker, came to the Lars' moisture farm looking for his mother. Accompanying him was Padmé Amidala. Owen introduced himself and Beru to the guests and Cliegg explained of the Tusken Raider's taking of Shmi. He told Anakin he would do anything to help out the young Jedi, but his injury was too far from healed, and could not have been much of a help. That night Anakin set out to look for Shmi on his own. The next morning, he brought back Shmi's lifeless body, quietly blaming the Larses for being too weak to protect her. A small funeral was organized and soon afterward, Anakin and Padmé left and were allowed to take C-3PO with them.[9]
            Owen and Beru married in 21 BBY and took over the moisture farm the next year when Cliegg succumbed to his injuries and passed away.[3][10] Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars and after Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader, Owen and Beru were contacted by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin's former mentor. Kenobi informed them that Anakin fathered two children (a pair of twins), and his son Luke needed a family. Beru convinced Owen to adopt him, and Kenobi delivered the baby to them shortly afterward. Owen stubbornly kept his distance and his back turned to Kenobi as he handed baby Luke to Beru.[11]
            Fearful of having Luke follow Anakin's path, Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru protected their nephew from his past by telling him that his father, rather than being a Jedi Knight, "was a navigator on a spice freighter". Owen also tried to keep him away from the "crazy old hermit," "Ben" Kenobi.
            A few years later, Kenobi had found Luke and his friend Windy Marstrap alone in the Jundland Wastes. The two youths had tried to ease their boredom by riding Windy's pet dewback around in the Wastes. They had been thrown in one of the canyons and had gotten bruised up. By dusk, Luke and Windy still hadn't found their way out of the canyon until they were discovered by Ben Kenobi. After Kenobi guided them back to the Lars farm, Owen told Luke and his friend to go inside so they would be out of earshot, then confronted and berated Kenobi.
            The reason for Owen's anger was that Kenobi had attempted to give Anakin's lightsaber to Luke, since he felt that Luke was old enough and should be allowed to have it. Owen refused to allow it because he believed the Jedi path was a destructive one. He told Kenobi he didn't want Luke to make the same mistakes his father did, stating how he felt Anakin should have never left his mother in slavery and gotten involved with the "damned foolish idealistic Jedi crusaders" in the first place. He vehemently told Kenobi to leave and to stay away.
            Luke, however, being Anakin's son, had wild dreams for a different and adventurous future. Despite Owen's vague promises that he would sometime be free to live his own life, he always prevented Luke from leaving the isolation and anonymity of life on the planet Tatooine, claiming his importance to the farm. This stance sometimes brought turmoil between their relations as Luke's hopes were never satisfied.
            Kenobi continued to watch Luke from a distance, sometimes seeing Luke pilot his T-16 skyhopper very skillfully.
            By the time of the Galactic Civil War, extensive exposure to Tatooine's twin suns had prematurely aged his body.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Owen_Lars/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascOwenLars</string></dict>
        <key>Cliegg Lars</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.595.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cliegg Lars was a human male moisture farmer from Tatooine. He had one son, Owen Lars, from his first marriage. In the years prior to the Clone Wars, he met Shmi Skywalker and freed her from slavery before marrying her. As such, he was the step-father of Anakin Skywalker, and the step-grandfather of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.
            Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Shmi was captured by a band of Tusken Raiders. Lars and a number of other moisture farmers attempted to save her, but the sand people drove them back, and Lars lost his right leg as a result. Anakin Skywalker later arrived on Tatooine, having had visions through the Force of Shmi's suffering and met Lars. Skywalker found his mother, but she died in his arms and he returned her body to the Lars moisture farm for burial, where Lars said goodbye to his wife before dying sometime later.
            Cliegg Lars was born on Tatooine to Gredda and Lef Lars. He had a brother named Edern, but he died at the age of fourteen in a landspeeder accident.[5] When Cliegg grew up, he became a moisture farmer.[1] He lived on his family's homestead near the settlement of Anchorhead.[1] He married a woman named Aika and together they had a son, whom they named Owen. However, Aika died and Cliegg and Owen continued to run the homestead.[6] Later on, Owen's girlfriend Beru Whitesun, went to live with them on the farm.[3]
            A few years before the Clone Wars, Lars took a trip to the spaceport settlement of Mos Espa, where he met Shmi Skywalker, a slave owned by Watto, a Toydarian junk dealer. Lars fell in love with Shmi and bought her from Watto,[1] thus freeing her from slavery. The two married and lived together as husband and wife for many years. Approximately, one month before the Battle of Geonosis, however, Shmi was kidnapped by a group of Tusken Raiders. An enraged Lars gathered dozens of other farmers and set out to rescue his wife. Although thirty farmers went out looking for her, only four returned alive. Lars himself returned maimed, having lost his right leg to the sand people.[3]
            A month after Shmi's disappearance, her son, Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker arrived on the farm looking for her, having had Force visions of her suffering. Lars and his family met Skywalker for the first time and explained to him what had happened with the Tusken Raiders. Although Lars told his stepson to accept that Shmi was gone, Skywalker was determined to find his mother and set out into the desert to locate the sand people. He found them and his mother, but she died in his arms. Skywalker returned to the farm after slaughtering the Tusken Raiders for revenge, and, along with Lars and his family, buried Shmi on the farm next to Lars's brother and parents.[7] Skywalker left shortly thereafter, leaving the Lars family behind.[3] Soon after these events, Cliegg died, passing on the moisture farm to his son and his daughter-in-law Beru.[2]
            Lars was a human male[1] who stood at a height of 1.83 meters.[4] He had light brown hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. While attempting to rescue his wife, Lars lost his right leg in pursuit of the Tusken Raiders. He felt an anger towards the sand people for taking Shmi, and felt that they were savage and vicious monsters.[3]
            Cliegg Lars was introduced and made his first canonical appearance in the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.

            Davik Kang posted a bounty on his head due to his inability to pay 200 credits of Davik's cut. Fearful for his life, Largo hid in the North Apartments, where he was found by Revan in 3956 BBY.
            When he explained his predicament to Revan, the former Sith Lord gave Largo 200 credits so he could pay off the debt. Relieved, but also shocked that Revan would sacrifice money for a complete stranger, Largo expressed his gratitude and hurried to hand the sum off to Davik. Sure enough, the bounty was lifted promptly afterwards.
            When his life was endangered by a bounty on his head, Largo was reduced to abject paranoia as he hid in his apartment awaiting the moment bounty hunters discovered his location. He was a nervous wreck when Revan encountered him, pleading and groveling, and desperate enough to immediately offer money in exchange for his life. Despite this, if it became clear that a bounty hunter before him wanted him dead, he was capable of mustering the courage to fend for himself, believing that if he were to die, it would be better to do so in a fight than as a coward.
            Largo possessed a single blaster pistol which he carried at his side at all times when his life was threatened by bounty hunters.
            Upon meeting the player, Largo will immediately offer to give 50 credits to convince Revan not to reveal his location to Davik. Should the player accept, dark side points will be earned along with a reprimand by Carth Onasi if he is in the party at the time.
            Similarly, if the player chooses the light side option and Carth is present, Carth will praise Revan's generosity while admitting that he hope they wouldn't need those credits later.
            Whether or not the player accepts Largo's bribe, Largo can be killed and his bounty collected from Zax for dark side points.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Largo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascLargo</string></dict>

        <key>Cay Qel-Droma</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.600.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cay Qel-Droma was a Human male who served as a Jedi Knight during the events of the Great Sith War. Born on Alderaan to a family with Jedi heritage, Qel-Droma and his older brother, fellow Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma, were instructed by Master Arca Jeth at his training compound on Arkania. Qel-Droma's first mission came in 4000 BBY, when, along with his brother and fellow trainee Tott Doneeta, he was sent to Onderon to put down an uprising of the Beast Riders from the planet's wilderness against the walled city of Iziz. The Jedi succeeded, but Qel-Droma's career on the fields of battle had just begun.
            He helped quell the Naddist Uprising started by a dark side cult on Onderon, and later fought in the Great Sith War, a galaxy-spanning conflict that started when the dark side organization known as the Krath took control of the Empress Teta system. During the war, Ulic turned to the dark side, becoming a Sith, and second-in-command under Dark Lord Exar Kun. Though Kun attempted to lure Qel-Droma to the dark side as well, he could not be tempted, and remained a Jedi, a proud defender of the Galactic Republic. Qel-Droma fought opposite his brother in battles such as the Battle of Coruscant. In 3996 BBY Qel-Droma finally came face-to-face with Ulic, dueling him on Ossus. Ulic killed his brother, though he regretted the act enough to abandon the dark side. Filled with guilt, Ulic lived the rest of his life a broken man.
            Cay Qel-Droma was born on Alderaan to the Jedi Master Lien-Tsai Qel-Droma. He was very skilled in the Force, but his mother did not train him, believing that she would be unable to maintain the emotional separation required to train Cay, and his older brother, Ulic, as Jedi. Together with Ulic, Cay Qel-Droma was sent to Arca Jeth's Jedi training center on Arkania for further instruction. Even at a young age, the two boys were the best of friends.[1] Alongside the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta, the two learned the ways of the Force from the venerated Jedi Master. The three young Jedi learned much from the respected Master, such as lightsaber combat and different Force skills. Cay Qel-Droma also advanced his love for machines by frequently repairing any droids or other machines that had bugs.[3] During their training, Cay began to grow concerned for Ulic as his older brother grew frustrated when he failed at something. He attempted to voice his concerns through jokes, although Ulic remained very intense about training.[1]
            In 4000 BBY, Jeth was chosen as the Jedi Watchman of the Onderon system. He hoped to resolve the centuries-long Beast Wars that had plagued Onderon. However, he was not to go himself. Instead, he sent his three apprentices on their first real test—a mission with lives hanging in the balance. Onderon was home to many savage beasts, some of which had been tamed by outlaws known as Beast Riders. These beasts had forced the other citizens of Onderon into one giant walled city, Iziz, which was constantly under attack from the Beast Riders, who had been at war with the monarchy of the city for centuries.[3]
            When the three Jedi arrived in the Qel-Dromas' ship, the Nebulon Ranger, they were attacked by a group of Beast Riders on their drexl mounts. However, due to the expert piloting skills of Doneeta and the Qel-Droma brothers, the ship was able to land in Iziz intact. Once in the city, they introduced themselves to a group of security officers sent to welcome them, only to see Tott Doneeta nearly arrested, as the city had a policy against any alien species. Furious, the brothers drew their lightsabers, and the guards reluctantly released Doneeta. The three were then led to the throne room of Queen Amanoa.[3]
            The Jedi were introduced to the queen and her daughter, Princess Galia. Seconds later, a group of Beast Riders swept into the palace, breaking the glass windows and landing in the throne room. The trio fought the Riders alongside the guards, but they were unable to stop them from kidnapping Galia. After they had taken her, the Riders retreated. Amanoa was furious at the Jedi, claiming that they had aided the Beast Riders. Ulic promised that the three of them would rescue her daughter, insisting that they would not return until they had freed her.[3]
            Flying above the forests, the Nebulon Ranger was fired on by Beast Riders, and crashed. Though the three Jedi survived, they would have to make it to the Beast Riders' fortress on foot. On their way to the Riders' citadel, they were attacked by Boma beasts. However, with Doneeta's ability to speak beast languages, he was able to make the creatures halt, giving he and his companions a ride to the fortress. Once there, they crashed in, interrupting the wedding between Galia and the Beast Riders' second-in-command, Oron Kira, son of chief Modon Kira. Though Ulic attempted to save Galia, he was stunned when she told him that she did not want to be rescued. Hoping to make peace with the Jedi, Kira invited them to put down their weapons and join the wedding banquet.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cay_Qel-Droma</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCayQelDroma</string></dict>

            Although Algwinn considered himself weak, in actuality he was not as corrupted by the dark side as the other Sith hopefuls. This caused him to have doubts about his place at the Academy. When the Jedi and former Sith Lord Revan infiltrated the Academy in his search for the Star Map on the planet, he attempted to persuade Algwinn to become a Jedi. Algwinn was conflicted by the different viewpoints presented to him, but before he could come to a decision, he was killed when the residents of the Academy attacked Revan after discovering that he was a spy.[1]
            Although canonically Kel Algwinn does not join the Jedi Order, the player as Revan can successfully persuade him to do so, at which point he departs from the academy. If the player suggests that Kel join the Jedi before the destruction of Dantooine, he or she can talk to him in the training room of the Jedi Enclave, where Kel is now dressed as a Jedi Padawan.
            If the player is a dark-side character, after discovering Kel's doubts, Revan can: tell Uthar Wynn or Yuthura Ban about them—after which Kel disappears from the academy, taunt him into fighting and kill him, or speak with him and convince him that the dark side is where he belongs.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kel_Algwinn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKelAlgwinn</string></dict>
        <key>Coorta</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.602.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Coorta was a Miner at the Peragus Mining Facility in 3951 BBY with a notorious reputation for criminal activities and a strong desire to leave the facility to do something more profitable. He sought an opportunity by selling Meetra Surik, a Jedi who fought in the Mandalorian Wars and was exiled by her Order to the Exchange who had a Bounty for live Jedi. However, he was soon betrayed by a HK-50 series assassin droid posing as the Peragus Mining Facility Maintenance Officer and was killed in circumstances leading to the Skirmish at Peragus II.
            Coorta was a well known miner around the Peragus Mining Facility because of his undergound activities such as smuggling contraband such as blasters, spice and grenades, which earned him the ire of a few high ranking personnel such as the Security Officer because of the volatile nature of mining Peragus II Fuel. When the fuel was initailly mined it caused Peragus II to explode, creating the Peragus Asteroid field and subsiquent mining facility.[1]
            in 3951 BBY, not long after the Jedi Civil War, Meetra Surik, an exiled Jedi arrived at the facility injured and unconscious aboard a battered Ebon Hawk helped by her Droid T3-M4 who managed to program the ship into the facilty despite lacking Astrogation charts.[1] The ship also had a HK-50 Assassin droid that disabled T3-M4. The droid then posed as Meetra's master and her protocol droid, through questioning informed the Administration Officer of Meetra's history. The Officer hoped to keep the information away from the miners but Coorta would soon learn from another miner who had apparently been in her service. Coorta immediately began conspiring with his other miners, who were supposed to siphon the 32-18 asteroid shelf, the idea of selling Surik to the Exchange, which had posted a massive bounty on Jedi. Over time he tried to recruit others, several of the miners agreed that this would be in their best interests, while others, such as the Mine Foreman Sien wanted nothing to do with it.[1] But the Administration Officer was able to put a stop to his plans. But knowing that Coorta won't give up, the Officer decided to make contact with the Republic, hoping to inform them of the location of Surik to get her of the facility to Telos IV before Coorta could ship her of to Nar Shaddaa.[1]
            In order to accomplish his mission, the HK-50 set a plan in motion to prevent the Republic from coming to rescue Surik.[1] He contacted Coorta, who was supposed to be ready for the 32-19K asteroid, using the maintenance officer's voice and convinced him that they would be able to sell Surik to the Exchange. The plan was to detain all of the miners in the dormitories with a few well timed explosions resulting in a lockdown and cover their tracks ensuring the Republic will not be alerted to their presence. Coorta was to use his contacts to provide transportation out of the Peragus system. Although slightly suspicious he proceeded anyway.[1]
            Sien, who earlier tried to reason with Coorta about his intentions to sell the Jedi but was unsuccessful, overheard the pair's plans wanted to report the scheme to the Administration Officer but hesitated because of the amount of trouble it would bring. Sien soon learned of the plans in clear detail but instead of the Administration Officer or Coorta, he confronted the real maintenance officer, who was unaware of the situation and said he had nothing to do with it. He was in the middle of his log called "Must Take Action! when Coorta knocked him out before he could take further action and his logs were flushed down the refresher in an unsuccessful attempt to get rid of the evidence.[1]
            Within hours HK-50, using the Maintenance Officer's voice, commanded the Mining droids to "mine" the miners while creating detonations that caused casualties within the facility. Soon the Droid triggered an explosion that caused much of the surviving crew to evacuate their stations to flood their dormitories. What they were not aware of was that the explosion damaged the ventilation systems which would soon flood the rooms with toxic fumes.[1]
            Coorta never realised that HK-50 had no intention of honoring their agreement. When the time came to trigger the emergency lockdown HK-50 attempted to lock Coorta with the other miners. Coorta barely made it out but his efforts were all for naught, as HK-50 reversed the turbolift codes in case Coorta managed to get far enough, the droid revealed its true colours to Coorta and ordered several mining droids, armed with mining lasers and drills, to kill him and his conspirators who couldn't get the lift to work.[1]
            HK-50 gloated his victory to Coorta's dead body and drugged the Jedi, and other miners in their Kolto tanks with enough sedatives to kill the miners, but caused her to be in a deep sleep to patiently wait for his own transport to take the bounty to Nar Shaddaa.[1] However Meetra Surik woke up, much earlier then he predicted. She managed to pick up every log she could find, including Coorta's, to piece together the story of what happened over the last 3 days. She, Kreia, another passenger of the Ebon Hawk and Atton Rand, a smuggler who was in the brig for a security violation that, ironically, spared his life would soon join together to try to escape the facility. They were confronted by the HK-50, who confessed his actions about sabotaging the facility and the Hammerhead-class cruiser Harbinger to her and after Surik refused to go back into the Kolto Tank, she fought the Droid destroying it, avenging the deaths of the miners. The facility was soon afterwards destroyed when the Harbinger fired on the Ebon hawk and in the insuring skirmish triggered the very chain reaction of explosions that made the facility dangerous from the very beginning. Coorta's body was likely engulfed in the explosion.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coorta</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCoorta</string></dict>

He was the sole heir of a wealthy family, and was not well-liked. He lived alone at his family villa with droids as his only companions. He had a small army of IG-series droids, an H2 pilot droid, and a protocol droid nicknamed "E-10."
            Qua, believing that his money allowed him to do anything he wished, had the habit of eating sentient beings. He purchased slaves, often young ones, of different species, only to have E-10 cook and serve them to him. He purchased a child slave from slave trader Orso Meeto on Orvax IV every ten days. Resa Greenbark was one of the unfortunate slaves bought for food. After Resa's father and the crew of the freighter Uhumele raided the Qua villa in search of her, Dass Jennir shot an unarmed Qua in the chest with a blaster upon learning of Resa's fate.
            Following his death, Qua's family hired bounty hunter Falco Sang to hunt down Jennir and his companions.
            Dezono Qua was a solitary individual, who was able to cover his disturbing idiosyncrasies with wealth and power. As such, he had no conscientious individuals surrounding him in his home, and would only make use of droids with unwavering loyalty to him.
            In addition to this, Qua possessed little to no empathy or sympathy for those whose relatives he had consumed, even when met face-to-face; his encounter with Bomo Greenbark and his companions reflected this. Even in the face of death at blasterpoint, Qua, in a most insensitive and blasé manner, expressed no remorse for his deeds, only showing true emotion when reflecting on consuming Resa.
            Dezono Qua was first mentioned in the graphic novel installment Dark Times 4: The Path to Nowhere, Part 4, and made an appearance in the subsequent installment, Dark Times 5: The Path to Nowhere, Part 5. Since then, the character has received passing mentions as a footnote in successive issues.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dezono_Qua</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDezonoQua</string></dict>

He wore yellow Neo-Crusader armor reserved for Mandalorian high-ranking warriors. He gave Meetra Surik the task of finding and retrieving Kumus's gear, presuming him dead in the jungle, after having been gone for 3 days. Surik returned with a living Kumus, who, unbeknownst to Xarga, had simply been stuck atop a possible cache-site rigged with explosives, with Bomas below, until Surik slew them.

        <key>Xanatos</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.609.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Xanatos was a Human male failed Jedi and the second Padawan of Qui-Gon Jinn, who earlier had trained a young Jedi named Feemor. He was the son of Telosian Governor Crion, the brother of Nason and fathered a boy named Granta with Tura Omega.
            During the final trial that would have made him a Jedi Knight, Xanatos was corrupted by the mind and power of his father. After he witnessed his sister Nason's death in a riot and Crion's death at the hands of his former master Jinn, he became a Dark Jedi and the head of a mining facility on his homeworld of Telos IV.
            Nine years later, Xanatos fought Jinn and his new pupil, Obi-Wan Kenobi, on Bandomeer. Later, he planned to bring the Jedi Temple into ruins, but the two Jedi put a stop to that at once. After one final humiliation that nearly placed him at the hands of Telosian authorities, Xanatos committed suicide by leaping into a pool of acid.
            Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn discovered Xanatos when the boy was very young. Impressed by his Force-potential and his brilliant mind, Jinn decided, after some brief hesitation, to bring Xanatos to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to see if he could be trained.[1][8] In doing so, Xanatos was taken away from the three things he loved most at an early age: Crion, his father; Nason, his sister; and Telos IV, his home planet.[1][9] Crion gave his consent for Xanatos to leave for the Jedi Order. Once Xanatos arrived to Coruscant, he tried to impress other younglings with his powerful background. Qui-Gon ignored this fault and went on to train him as a Jedi.[1]
            After achieving the rank of Jedi Master by training his first Padawan Feemor,[5] Jinn took Xanatos to be his second Padawan. Jinn trained Xanatos for a number of years going on various missions, though Xanatos tended to be aggressive, which concerned the Jedi Council.[1] He was the only Padawan in his time to specialize in infrastructure models at the Temple, surpassing his Initiate rival, Miro Daroon.[8]
            Xanatos met Feemor at least once during a sparring match between the latter and Qui-Gon in 53 BBY.[5]
            As a final test for Xanatos, Yoda, skeptical of his readiness to be a Jedi Knight, sent him, Qui-Gon, Master Tahl, and Masterless Padawan Orykan Tamarik, to Telos, where the planet was in a brutal crises secretly started by Xanatos' father Crion—governor of the planet Telos IV.[5]
            Crion, now a corrupt governor of Telos, regretted sending his sixteen-year-old son to the Jedi Temple. He encouraged Xanatos to stay with him on Telos and enjoy wealth and power. After the death of his sister, Nason,[10] Xanatos sided with his father in the civil war, thus failing his final test.[11] Under Crion's direction, he sabotaged the first meeting to rally the Telosians against Toprawa.[1] But as the former Jedi Dairoki confessed having committed crimes in Crion's name, Hukowl An Devi, one of the governor's top advisers, revealed the truth to the people of Telos. Civil war soon broke out.[12] Xanatos was said to have been appointed as the head of the Telosian army.[1]
            Jinn went after Crion himself, hoping to rescue Xanatos from the madness his father had caused, but the governor attempted to duel Jinn instead. Xanatos watched in terror as his former master rushed to Padawan Tamarik's rescue, thus destroying the sword Crion wielded and knocking the governor into among the decorative fires of his palace. Crion died instantly. Jinn tried to apologize, but Xanatos' inextinguishable anger at his father's death caused him to turn to the dark side. He picked up his father's burning right hand from the nearby fireplace and pressed the ring (which had been cut by Jinn's lightsaber) to his right cheek.[1][12] The broken-circle scar later became his "trademark" and the symbol for the Offworld Mining Corporation, a company he took control of through deceit and conspiracy.[1] Before Xanatos and Qui-Gon could fight each other, the rioters stormed the palace and Xanatos was forced to escape.[12] He stole the Telosian treasury and fled the planet on a transport.[1]
            Jinn told the Council that he had "died" in the fighting on Telos.[12] It was also symbolic as he intended to disrupt Jinn's life and the lives of others he could exploit. Xanatos would go on to stir up trouble for Qui-Gon Jinn and his new apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi in the years preceding the Invasion of Naboo.[1]
            At some time after the civil war had ended, Xanatos became the first citizen of Telos. His first order of business was to "investigate" his late father's deeds and made fraudulent evidence to clear Crion's name. He became a hero to his fellow Telosians and possessed immense influence within the government, including the current Governor of Telos.[3]
            Xanatos became the head of the Offworld Corporation, which was mining in Telos' restoration areas, such as the Park of Sacred Pools. He distracted the citizens with a gambling project supposedly controlled by the government called Katharsis, which would provide "tax breaks." The profits from Katharsis were supposedly used for the restoration of Telos; he supported libraries, parks, medcenters, and founded a healing institute named after him in Thani. In truth, Offworld, under the name of UniFy, controlled Katharsis, which was fixed so the winner was only given a fraction of the credits and the rest, including profits, were used by Offworld to conduct its mining programs. Any political group who spoke out against UniFy, such as the POWER party, was outlawed.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Xanatos</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascXanatos</string></dict>

            Havoc, along with the rest of Tango Company, served at the Second Battle of Geonosis, and afterwards was sent on a medical supply run to Ord Cestus. While aboard a Republic supply ship that was being transported back to Republic space by Jedi Commanders Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee, he heard the sound of blaster shots in the mess hall. He rushed in to investigate with the leader of Tango Company, Trap, only to be interrogated by Ahsoka and Barriss, the two having just survived an attack by two other clones, Ox and Edge. Once Havoc and Trap convinced the Jedi that they were not their enemies, the four attempted to contact the bridge via comlink but failed to receive any response. As a result, the Jedi left to inspect the bridge, instructing Havoc to stay behind to watch over the unconscious Ox and Edge.
            While Ahsoka and Barriss were away, Havoc fell prey to the Geonosian brain worms that had stowed aboard the ship and was subsequently mind-controlled, just as Ox and Edge had been. Later he along with the Scythe and Edge, pinned down the final uninfected clone trooper on the ship and infected him with a brain worm. Immediately afterwards, he and the rest of the clones were forced to attack the Jedi that had been watching the act.

        <key>CT-7567</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.612.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>CT-7567 was a veteran clone trooper captain who led the Grand Army of the Republic's acclaimed 501st Legion during the Clone Wars. Bred and trained on the planet Kamino, CT-7567 entered into Republic service at the Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY. He gained respect from Jedi officers and clone troopers alike as an honorable commander, becoming known as one of the best and toughest clone troopers in the Grand Army. He was even selected for special command training under Advanced Recon Commando Alpha-17, following which he took the nickname "Rex." As the captain of the 501st, Rex served as second-in-command to Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, whose bravery and unorthodoxy in battle he came to share. He was close friends with Marshal Commander Cody, with their relationship mirroring that of their respective Jedi Generals, Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The four of them often received joint assignments to coordinate front-line campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
            At the Battle of Christophsis, Rex became a mentor to Skywalker's newly assigned Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, with whom he forged a strong bond. He also managed to rebound from the following Battle of Teth, an engagement he would never forget due to the near-complete eradication of his 501st unit, Torrent Company. While on a listening post inspection tour with Cody, Rex rallied a small team of rookie soldiers to retake Rishi Station, which they thereafter destroyed to thwart Confederate General Grievous's planned invasion of Kamino. He was soon deployed on tour aboard Skywalker's flagship, the Resolute, and joined Skywalker and Tano in leading 501st offensives at Bothawui, JanFathal, and other flashpoints across the galaxy. He took part in countless campaigns in the galactic theater of war, from the containment of the Blue Shadow Virus on Naboo and the liberation of Ryloth to other hard-won victories like the Battle of Malastare, the Second Battle of Geonosis, and the Battle of Kamino.
            Throughout his career, Rex proved to be an effective leader who truly cared for the men under his command, even as he began to doubt his own future—and those of his clone brethren—in the Republic. The Battle of Saleucami of 21 BBY saw him meet the clone deserter Cut Lawquane, whom he came to respect despite their striking differences. His leadership was put to the ultimate test at the Battle of Umbara, when he was forced to unite the 501st Legion under an interim Jedi General, the obstinate and aggressive Pong Krell. Rex did not see eye-to-eye with Krell and found himself having to balance his troops' well-being with Krell's high-casualty plans. When Krell manipulated the 501st into a fatal confrontation with their comrades from the 212th Attack Battalion, Rex realized their general was a traitor to the Republic, and he risked charges of treason to lead his men in arresting Krell. The ordeal refined his hard-line obedience to orders, as he also learned the value of making his own decisions as a soldier.
            Rex's unwavering dedication to the Republic kept him on the front lines over the three-year span of the Clone Wars. He aided Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi in rescuing Togruta colonists from the Zygerrian Slave Empire and, in 20 BBY, offered his soldier's expertise to help the Jedi train local insurgents on Onderon to emancipate their world. In a stark turn of events, he and Skywalker apprehended Tano on Coruscant after she was framed for a bombing of the Jedi Temple, an incident that culminated in her departure from the Jedi Order. In addition, Rex and Skywalker gave pursuit of a longtime comrade, ARC trooper Fives, who had gone rogue after unearthing an anti-Jedi directive that had been bred into all of the Republic's clone troopers. Before Fives could prove his findings to Rex and Skywalker, the Coruscant Guard gunned him down for resisting arrest. By war's end in 19 BBY, Rex ceded his command over the 501st to another officer, Commander Appo, who oversaw the unit into the rise of the Galactic Empire.
            A Human male clone of the acclaimed bounty hunter Jango Fett,[3] the clone trooper who received the designation CT-7567[1] was born around the year 32 BBY[2] on the planet Kamino for service in the Grand Army of the Republic.[3] Granted advanced growth by the Kaminoan cloners,[3] he was part of one of the first batches of clone troopers,[8] and his early life largely incorporated Kaminoan flash training.[3] As was the case with other clones who became officers, the Kaminoans spotted his natural leadership abilities early on, and over the next decade, he was put through additional command training and intensive programmed learning to develop his skills.[1][9] By 22 BBY, he had begun training as a squad leader.[8]
            That same year,[10] CT-7567 served on the planet Geonosis[11] in the opening battle of what became known as the Clone Wars,[1][12] fighting on the side of the Galactic Republic against the native Geonosians and the Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.[5] He survived[12] the First Battle of Geonosis[13] and continued his Grand Army service in the resultant intergalactic conflict, swearing to defend all Republic citizens from harm[14] as part of his oath of loyalty to the Republic state.[15] He served with Jedi Generals on multiple occasions and learned to respect their abilities;[9] in turn, Jedi officers came to rely on him. Thanks to his aggression on the battlefield, he earned a reputation as one of the Republic Military's best and toughest clone troopers.[13][16] Such was his prowess and performance that he was withdrawn from his unit[8] and was among the 100 clone officers recalled to Kamino to undergo specialized command training.[17]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/CT-7567/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCT7567</string></dict>
        <key>CT-5597</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.613.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>CT-5597, nicknamed "Jesse," was a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic's 501st Legion during the Clone Wars. Jesse participated in a hunt for the Confederate General Grievous on the planet Saleucami around 21 BBY. During the hunt, Jesse, along with troopers Hardcase and Kix, went with Clone Captain Rex to search for escape pods that had been jettisoned from Grievous' crashed ship. After two commando droids attacked and injured Rex, Jesse, Hardcase, and Kix took the injured Captain to a nearby homestead to recover, and then afterward Jesse led the remaining two clones to High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was leading another group of clones troopers on the planet. Continuing his service in the 501st Legion, Jesse went with the legion to the Confederate-aligned world Umbara, where he participated in a battle alongside Rex and Jedi General Anakin Skywalker.
            After engaging the Umbaran Soldiers in combat on the world, another Jedi, General Pong Krell, arrived on Umbara and relieved Skywalker of his duties. As the interim leader of the 501st, Krell wanted Jesse and the clones to take over Umbara's capital city. A nearby airbase was resupplying the city's defenses, although after Hardcase and ARC Trooper Fives infiltrated the base, Krell's troops forced the Umbaran militia there to surrender, allowing the Republic force to fortify themselves in the airbase. After Jesse and the battle group learned of a Confederate supply ship in orbit of the planet, Jesse and Hardcase joined Fives' mission of destroying the ship. The three clones used Umbaran starfighters to board the supply ship, and once there, Hardcase sacrificed himself by staying behind to destroy the ship. Jesse and Fives returned to Umbara, only to be imprisoned for disobeying orders from Krell. The two clones were to be executed for their crime, although Krell soon revealed himself to be a traitor of the Republic. After Krell was captured by the clones, which would later result in Krell's death, Jesse and Fives were set free, and the battle resulted in a Republic victory.
            CT-5597, who went by the nickname "Jesse," was a clone trooper who served in the Grand Army of the Republic.[2] Around 21 BBY,[3] during the Clone Wars, Jesse served the Galactic Republic under the command of High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi. After a battle above the planet Saleucami, Confederate General Grievous used an escape pod to jettison from his starship and landed on Saleucami's surface. Chasing after Grievous, Kenobi gathered a team of clone troopers, including Jesse, to find the cyborg general on the planet's surface.[2] The team found the wreckage of a crashed ship,[4] and Commander CC-2224, nicknamed "Cody," told Kenobi that the ship had crashed recently. Kenobi decided to split the group into two teams and ordered Captain CT-7567, nicknamed "Rex," to find the other missing escape pods with troopers Jesse, Kix and Hardcase, while he, Cody, and Crys stayed behind to go through the remains of the crashed ship.[2]
            After mounting separate BARC speeders, the team drove through the wetlands of the planet's surface. Ahead of them, two commando droids were on top of a hill overlooking the clones. Utilizing a blaster sniper rifle, one of the droids shot Rex, knocking the clone captain off his speeder. Jesse ordered Kix and Hardcase to turn their BARCs around and protect the captain, while he drove toward the hill from where the shot had been fired. Jesse used his BARC speeder's blaster cannons to fire at the droids, destroying them. Returning to Rex, the team's medic, Kix, informed Jesse that Rex's injury was severe. Jesse told the team that the two droid commandos might have called for backup, and they needed to find shelter for Rex.[2] After noticing domesticated eopies,[4] Jesse concluded that they were on farmland, which meant there was a nearby homestead. Kix attached a flatbed on a side of his BARC speeder and laid Rex on top of it before Jesse and the team drove off to find the farmer's homestead.[2]
            Upon arriving at the nearby homestead, a female Twi'lek, Suu, greeted the clones warily, pointing a rifle at the intruders. Jesse and Kix informed her that they were friends and they needed a place to settle the injured Rex for the night, and Suu gave the clones permission to use the barn. After Kix placed a bacta patch on Rex's wound, he regained consciousness and Jesse and the other troopers informed him of what had occurred. Before the team left to continue their search for the escape pods, Rex gave Jesse the responsibility of leading the search party. After the clones boarded their BARC speeders, Kenobi contacted the group via comlink and called for Rex. Jesse responded and informed the Jedi Master that Rex had been injured, and that the had given him the duty of leading the search for the escape pods. Kenobi told Jesse that Grievous was heading for an abandoned escape pod, and ordered the troopers to drive westward.[2]
            Soon, Jesse contacted Kenobi, and the clone trooper told him that he had a visual of the escape pod. Grievous was the first to arrive at the escape pod, and Kenobi had already engaged Grievous' forces by the time Jesse's team arrived on their BARC speeders. As Jesse fired his speeder's blaster cannons at Grievous' battle droids, he spotted an approaching Confederate shuttle in the sky and warned Kenobi via comlink. After a clone trooper on board an AT-TE walker told Kenobi that the walker's guns were overheated, Kenobi ordered Cody and Jesse to cover him as he raced toward Grievous. Kenobi and Grievous engaged in a lightsaber duel as the Confederate shuttle approached them, eventually coming to a hovering stop above the escape pod; Grievous fired his tow cable on the hull of the shuttle and fled in the vehicle. Jesse and Cody, on board their speeders, returned to Kenobi after dispatching the remaining battle droids. The Jedi Master told both clone troopers to contact the fleet and order them to send a transport to pick them up.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/CT-5597/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCT5597</string></dict>

        <key>Crueya Vandron</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.618.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Crueya Vandron was the lord of House Vandron, one of the Ancient Houses of the Senex sector; additionally, he was an advisor to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and an important figure in the establishment of the New Order. Alongside his wife, Lady Theala Vandron, he ruled the Senex sector, an ancient domain that operated independently from the Galactic Republic.
            After the Senex sector finally joined the Republic during the Separatist Crisis, Vandron became an advisor to Chancellor Palpatine and a leading member of the Commission for the Protection of the Republic. When Palpatine dissolved the Republic and created the first Galactic Empire, Vandron helped shape the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order—COMPOR's successor—into a driving force in Imperial organization, alongside the likes of Ishin-Il-Raz, Ardus Kaine, and Janus Greejatus. While he was not a member of the organization personally, he provided the funding for much of its activities, and he also helped establish the Imperial Security Bureau; a Humanocentric and a deep believer in the Empire and its key ideals, he attempted to work the idea of "Imperial infallibility" into the Imperial legal code around 0 BBY, but was met with stern opposition by the Justice department. By 12 ABY, Theala Vandron Jr. had assumed the leadership of House Vandron.
            Crueya Vandron was born into nobility in the Senex sector during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He was a member of House Vandron,[3] thought to be the oldest and most noble of the Ancient Houses of Senex-Juvex.[4] Vandron eventually became an influential and powerful lord, and married Lady Theala Vandron. The Senex sector was an aristocracy that operated outside of the Republic, and had its own distinct laws and customs; they bred slaves, which was against the ideals of the Republic. Because of this, the Republic—under Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum—refused to openly trade with Crueya Vandron and his fellow lords, despite the urgings of the Senex sector's inhabitants.[3]
            In 33 BBY, members of the Nebula Front militant group seized control of one of the planets under the rule of House Vandron, Asmeru, from the few natives who inhabited it; as Vandron and his fellow lords did not want to become prey to the Front's attacks, they allowed them to operate out of Asmeru without interference. After a fruitless attempt to assassinate Chancellor Valorum that year, Nebula Front members led by Arwen Cohl fled to Asmeru; the houses of the Senex sector, and Crueya Vandron in particular, came under immense pressure from the Republic, who accused them of granting the terrorists safe haven. Knowing that cooperation with the Republic might persuade Valorum to grant the sector trading rights, Vandron and his counterpart in House Elegin denied the accusations, but offered to help Republic forces keep the Nebula Front resistance fighters on Asmeru while the Eriadu Trade Summit took place, to prevent the terrorists from interfering there.[3]
            Although the Republic was wary of working alongside slavers, they accepted Vandron's offer, sending two Consular-class cruisers and a team of thirty Judicials and several Jedi. During the mission, one of the cruisers was fired upon, though it was never learned who by; many, such as Senator Bail Antilles, suspected House Vandron was responsible, but Vandron publicly denied this. On the surface of Asmeru, the team of Jedi overstepped their bounds and attacked natives; Vandron used this as a bargaining chip against the Republic: he agreed to let the incident pass without formally objecting to the Jedi's actions in exchange for the trading rights the Senex sector so craved. With little other option, Valorum agreed to overlook their practices regarding slavery and granted them free trading with Republic states.[3]
            Eventually, sometime between the Blockade of Naboo in 32 BBY and the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, the Senex sector joined the Galactic Republic, at the urging of Terr Taneel, who became its first senator.[5] Crueya Vandron became a close advisor to Chancellor Palpatine, Valorum's successor. He became interested in COMPOR—the Commission for the Protection of the Republic—which was little more than a social gathering for fanatic supporters of the Republic;[1] Vandron, however, saw the potential to mold it into a propaganda machine.[2] The Senex lord was appointed to monitor the group and provide it with resources.[6]
            Midway during the Clone Wars, SAGroup, a sub-organization of COMPOR composed entirely of youths, held a massive rally in Monument Plaza on Coruscant, which garnered the attention of much of the Republic, particularly its media. However, while the rally itself was not criticized, many echelons of the media disapproved of what they viewed as Humanocentric tendencies in SAGroup; of its three thousand members, more than 95% were Human, and those select few non-Humans were all of near-Human descent. Vandron attempted to address these concerns, telling HoloNet News reporters that this was merely coincidence and that they had had many non-Human applicants, though none had been admitted.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Crueya_Vandron</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCrueyaVandron</string></dict>
        <key>Jahan Cross</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.619.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jahan Cross, born 33 BBY, was a male Human who served the Galactic Empire as an Imperial Intelligence agent. Growing up during the Clone Wars, Cross lost his mother and younger sister during the Battle of Coruscant. After enrolling in the Imperial Academy as a young man, Cross came into the employment of Armand Isard, director of Imperial Intelligence, and undertook delicate missions otherwise unsuitable for the Imperial Army as an "agent of the Empire". Cross underwent his missions with a droid companion, IN-GA 44, developed by Alessi Quon, who also developed much of Cross's arsenal. During a mission to the planet Wayland in 3 BBY, Cross uncovered a plot connecting the rogue Imperial colonel, Milosh Muhrlein, to Rossum Droidworks, a company owned by the thought-to-be-dead pirate, Iaco Stark. After unraveling a large conspiracy surrounding the development of a computer virus codenamed "Iron Eclipse" designed to turn all droids across the galaxy into killing machines, Cross discovered Stark to be alive and well on the gas giant Reltooine, albeit with his head grafted onto a droid body. With the assistance of his old friend from the Academy, Han Solo, Cross defeated Stark and escaped Reltooine, losing IN-GA in the process.
            Later, Cross was appointed to the planet Serenno, where he assassinated the local Count of the House Dooku, Adan. Cross was unaware of the political ties to the mission; believing Dooku to be an enemy of the Empire, the assassination was actually authorized in the favor of Rodas Borgin of the rivaling House Borgin. Though disillusioned with the mission, Cross accompanied Dooku's orphaned son and successor the title, Bron, to a summit aboard the Dooku airship, the Windrunner, where a new regent was to be appointed until Bron was of age. However, during the meeting, a pirate airship under the command of Vex, a former lover of Cross's, attacked the Windrunner and kidnapped Bron. Cross himself rescued Bron from Vex, who was subsequently arrested by local authorities and placed in a maximum security prison known as The Spike. Cross infiltrated the prison and rescued Vex with the intention of learning about her benefactor, who was none other than Rodas Borgin. In order to save Bron from further assassination or kidnapping attempts, Cross hired the renowned bounty hunter Boba Fett, manipulating Fett into believing Rodas Borgin had attempted to set him up for the murder of Bron Dooku. After Fett killed Borgin in retaliation, Cross sent Bron to live on Alderaan until he was old enough to return to Serenno and claim the title of Count for himself.
            Born on the planet Alderaan, Jahan Cross lived on the galactic capital Coruscant with his family during the Clone Wars, serving under the Galactic Republic. His father Davim's position in the Republic Diplomatic Corps provided a comfortable lifestyle, though this did nothing to shield Cross from the corruption evident in the Galactic Senate. He was present when the Confederacy of Independent Systems attacked Coruscant. An explosion from the attack knocked Cross unconscious and killed his mother instantly. He awoke later to see his younger sister, Jens, being hauled into the lower levels of Coruscant by the dwellers of the area who had come to the surface to use the confusion of the battle to pillage and loot. Cross followed them deep into the bowels of Coruscant, where he killed his first sentient but was several hours too late to save his sister.[4]
            In 3 BBY, Jahan Cross came across evidence that Milosh Muhrlein was engaged in illegal activities at the Imperial Research Station 61 on Wayland. He infiltrated and worked there for two weeks to dig up information. Cross and his droid IN-GA 44 confronted the commander, who attempted to bribe Cross. When Cross turned him down, Muhrlein ordered two experimental B2 super battle droids to destroy the intruders. Cross engaged Muhrlein, while IN-GA 44 eliminated the battle droids. While Muhrlein was protected by a Verpine force field that protected him from blaster fire, he was attacked with an electrical device hidden in the heels of Cross' shoes that passed through the force field and electrocuted Muhrlein.[3]
            Upon Cross's return to the Imperial Palace on Coruscant for debriefing, he was dressed down by his superior, Armand Isard, for killing an important and influential Imperial officer. Cross stated he was merely defending himself, and presented his evidence of the connections between Muhrlein and Rossum Droidworks. The data showed a strong link that Muhrlein was selling illegal droid technologies and protocols to Rossum Droidworks in the Corporate Sector and referred to a project called Iron Eclipse. Isard agreed to let Cross proceed to the Corporate sector for further investigation, but warned him that he was on his own.[3]
            Once Cross reached Etti IV in the Corporate Sector, he proceeded to look around since he was not met by an Imperial liaison. He collided into Han Solo, an old friend of his from the Imperial Academy as Solo fled from an angry group of gamblers. Along with Chewbacca, the three proceeded to brawl with the other group until the Espos arrived. Cross used his diplomatic immunity to prevent himself, Solo and Chewbacca from being arrested, drawing the ire of the local security forces.[3] Ambassador Vorlin's aide Emesh Nar met Cross and took him to the Imperial embassy so he could get freshened up for the party later that night.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jahan_Cross</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJahanCross</string></dict>
        <key>Cronal</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.620.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cronal, supposedly born as Perek, was a Human male and former Prophet of the Dark Side who was better known by his code name Blackhole, the mysterious Director of Imperial Intelligence. He also collaborated with Darth Vader after the Battle of Yavin to eliminate the Rebel Alliance. Adept at divination, Cronal was recruited by Emperor Palpatine from the Prophets to join the Empire. He abandoned himself to his meditations in the dark side, becoming withdrawn, physically frail, and paranoid. Considered Palpatine's "monster-maker," Cronal was responsible for the creation of several Sithspawn and other devices of Sith alchemy. As time passed, Cronal withdrew further, growing steadily more mad as the dark side consumed him.
            After being exiled during the Galactic Civil War, Cronal returned as a warlord, and took the name of Shadowspawn. With a cadre of the Emperor's Royal Guards and a legion of shadow stormtroopers at his disposal, Shadowspawn laid waste to worlds of the New Republic. He and his splinter Imperial faction blazed a path of death and destruction, committing acts of piracy, terrorism, and mass slaughter. Conquering the Inner Rim, the warlord established his base of operations on the world of Mindor. The New Republic, responding to the threat of Shadowspawn, sent the newly appointed General Luke Skywalker after him, starting a campaign that resulted in a substantial loss of life. Planning a trap for Skywalker on Mindor, Shadowspawn was defeated during the ensuing battle, where he perished. However, through means of the Force, he revived himself and later served the reborn Palpatine.
            In the time of the Empire, rumors abounded regarding Blackhole's origins. Some believed he was once a senatorial page taken under Palpatine's wing, while other rumors asserted that he was an assistant at the Jedi Archives on Coruscant who was ultimately seduced by the dark side of the Force.[4] Palpatine's court knew him as a Prophet of the Dark Side, a Sith splinter sect based out of Dromund Kaas. However, as it turned out, his involvement with matters dark and arcane went even deeper.
            Lord Cronal was, in fact, originally a member of the Sorcerers of Rhand, another dark-side cult based in the Nihil Retreat which was set in the Perann Nebula located in the Unknown Regions. The Sorcerers took him from his mother shortly after he was born and raised him as one of their members. Among the abilities they taught him was the power of Darksight. It was his use of Darksight which ultimately led him to leave the Sorcerers and the Unknown Regions and go to Dromund Kaas where he joined the Prophets of the Dark Side, and eventually the Empire. During this time he fathered a daughter, Sariss, though she remained unaware of her parentage.[5] As Cronal and the other Prophets heaped abuses on her, Sariss suspected one of them was her father, but never knew which.[8] As a Prophet, Cronal also helped train Palpatine's Inquisitor Jerec, and first taught him about the legendary Valley of the Jedi.[5]
            Cronal's abilities at divination were unequaled, and the unerring precision of his visions impressed Palpatine. However, as it turned out, Cronal was using his Darksight ability to not merely see the future, but to influence it as well. At the same time, however, Cronal feared his own fellow Prophets were beginning to turn against him. When Palpatine, realizing that Cronal's power was such that he could not be ignored, placed him at the head of Imperial Intelligence, Cronal felt that it was just in time. Taking the code name Blackhole, Cronal left the Prophets for Imperial Intelligence.[4]
            Lord Cronal's addition to the ranks of Imperial Intelligence was so smooth that few even realized he had joined. Cronal himself was extremely reclusive, even more so than the Emperor himself. Most of his work was carried out through droids, agents, and various fronts. In his rare appearances, Cronal presented himself through a holographic transmitter equipped with an image distorter and went by his code name, "Blackhole." Blackhole, to most, took the form of a vaguely humanoid figure anywhere from 1.8 to three meters tall, with a body resembling a shimmering starscape—or the robes of the Prophets of the Dark Side. The figure's head was entirely featureless, though eyes were sometimes visible[4] and sometimes not,[6] and the voice Blackhole transmitted was modulated so as to be androgynous.[4]
            Only a handful knew Cronal's true form: a shrunken, withered, and frail old man. Steeped in the affairs of the dark side, Cronal had abandoned what was left of his former self. The dark side sapped at his physical and mental health, and he was forced to spend his time in a specially-designed life support chamber. To aid his servant, Palpatine gifted Cronal with a Neimoidian mechano-assembly that could carry the spherical chamber around on its insectile legs.[4]
            As head of Intelligence, Cronal was granted virtually unlimited access and control over the Imperial HoloNet. He could take control of and appear in any holocomm unit in the Imperial Navy, or any one connected to the few civilian HoloNet nodes that still existed. He had unrivaled access to the galaxy's enormous quantities of information, and would spend his time in his sanctum meditating over the data that flowed across his screens and awaiting visions from the dark side of the Force.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cronal</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCronal</string></dict>
        <key>Crokind Shand</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.621.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Crokind Shand was a human male from the planet Nar Kanji who served as a member of the criminal Kanjiklub gang around thirty years after the Battle of Endor. He accompanied the gang's leader, Tasu Leech, and several other members in boarding the Baleen-class heavy freighter Eravana in order to reclaim 50,000 credits owed to the Kanjiklub by the vessel's owner, the smuggler Han Solo.
            Crokind Shand was born in the planet Nar Kanji.[1] He became a pit-fighter, but at some point this cost him an eye and his right leg as injuries, being forced to wear an eyepatch and cybernetic right leg.[3] Later in his life, he became a member of Tasu Leech's criminal gang Kanjiklub. At some point of his life, Corellian smuggler Han Solo got into debt with Kanjklub, owing them 50,000 credits.[2]
            In 34 ABY, Shand accompanied Leech and the other Kanjiklub members to Solo's vessel the Baleen-class heavy freighter Eravana to reclaim the 50,000 credits that Solo owed them. The Kanjiklub arrived in the freighter's airlock shortly after the Guavian Death Gang, who Solo also owed money, and the smuggler found himself trapped between the two groups. As Leech and Bala-Tik, frontman for the Death Squad, argued with Solo, the scavenger Rey and the former stormtrooper Finn, who Solo had recently brought aboard, accidentally released three rathtars that were being kept on the ship. The creatures immediately attacked the two criminal groups, and in the ensuing chaos, Shand was eaten by the rathars along with several of his comrades, while Solo and his companions managed to escape the creatures on board the Millennium Falcon.
            As a hard-bitten member of the Kanjiklub gang, Crokind Shand was a human male who wore an eyepatch and a cybernetic right leg rigged to deliver fierce kicks. He had tanned skin and black hair.[1] His missing eye and right leg were injuries that he suffered during his career as a pit-fighter. His appearance offered ample evidence that messing with him would be a potentially fatal mistake.[3]
            In battle he used a heavy bore rifle with a reinforced-galven circuit barrel and a roggwart bone rifle butt.[1]
            Crokind Shand first appeared in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in North America on December 18, 2015. The character was not named in the film, but received identification in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released in conjunction with the film. He was portrayed by Cecep Arif Rahman in the film, but his role was not listed in the end credits.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Crokind_Shand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCrokindShand</string></dict>
        <key>Arvel Crynyd</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.622.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Arvel Crynyd was a male human pilot who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. In the war's fourth year, Commander Crynyd participated in the Rebellion's attack on the Galactic Empire's second Death Star in the Battle of Endor, flying an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor in Green Squadron as leader of the squadron. When Crynyd was killed during the battle in a suicide run to destroy the Super Star Destroyer Executor, Lieutenant L'ulo L'ampar assumed command of the squadron. The battle ended soon after, seeing the destruction of the Death Star and death of Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine.
            Arvel Crynyd was a male human who flew as a Z-95 Headhunter pilot for a Thyferran bacta cartel before joining the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[2] With the Alliance, he fought in the Galactic Civil War, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Alliance and the Galactic Empire.[1] Holding the rank of commander,[3] Crynyd flew as a pilot in Green Squadron, operating an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor[1] In 4 ABY,[4] after the Bothan spynet discovered that Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine would be aboard the second Death Star to oversee its construction, Alliance High Command determined that launching an immediate assault on the space station would be their only chance to cripple the Empire.[1]
            With the full Alliance Fleet, Crynyd, under the callsign of Green Leader, exited hyperspace above the forest moon of Endor, approaching the superweapon in his A-wing. He was the last squadron leader to report stand-by status and prepared to attack the Death Star, but pulled up at the last second on General Lando Calrissian's orders when it was revealed that the shield was still up. Green Squadron was ordered to stick close to Sector MV-7 as a massive flotilla of Star Destroyers emerged from the other side of the moon. The Alliance had walked right into a trap, but were determined to go down fighting. Initially, both sides fought with only their starfighters to the rebels' confusion, but this turned to horror when the Death Star proved itself to be fully operational, firing its superlaser on the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty and reducing it to atoms. Following the advice of Calrissian, the remaining Rebel forces moved up alongside the Star Destroyers and fought at point-blank range, hoping the Death Star wouldn't dare shoot into its own fleet. When the shield protecting the Death Star was disabled, several fighters broke off and headed for it to destroy the reactor. To buy them time, Crynyd and his squadron attacked the Imperial flagship, the mighty Super Star Destroyer Executor, with two A-wings knocking out its bridge deflector shields. In response, Admiral Firmus Piett ordered the forward batteries to increase forward firing to prevent any window of opportunity from being exploited. As Crynyd attempted a trench run through the ship's superstructure, his fighter was struck by a laser bolt and spun wildly. Realizing he was doomed, Crynyd managed to wrestle what little control he had over his starfighter and put it on a collision course with the Executor's unshielded bridge tower. Letting out one last cry of defiance, Crynyd's ship crashed through the bridge windows and exploded, killing himself alongside Piett and the entire bridge crew. Without its command structure, the Executor lost primary power and plunged into the Death Star's gravity well, colliding with the station and detonating in a massive fireball. Crynyd's sacrifice tipped the battle in the Alliance's favor, with the Death Star being destroyed shortly after.[1]
            Crynyd was a human male with brown eyes and light skin.[1] Being a veteran pilot and instructor, Crynyd spent more time in an A-wing than anyone else in the Alliance Starfighter Corps. He praised the starfighter and maintained the notion that skilled A-wing pilots could easily outfly the TIE interceptor—the Imperial counterpart to the A-wing. Having also recognized that the lightly shielded A-wings couldn't stand up to Imperial-class Star Destroyers, Crynyd pushed them into reconnaissance and escort missions where speed meant strength.[3] He was also brave and dedicated to the Alliance cause to the extent that he was willing to sacrifice his life for it, crashing his crippled starfighter into the Executor.
            Crynyd possessed hyper-quick reflexes and an uncanny spatial sense.[2]
            As a pilot of the Alliance, Arvel Crynyd wore a green flight suit and helmet, while operating an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor.[1]
            Arvel Crynyd first appeared in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. He was portrayed by Hilton McRae in an uncredited role. Crynyd would later make an appearance in the first issue of the 2015 comic series Shattered Empire, Part I[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Arvel_Crynyd</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascArvelCrynyd</string></dict>
        <key>Crest</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.623.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"Crest" was a human male stormtrooper officer in service of the Galactic Empire around five years after the end of the Clone Wars, having served as a clone trooper during the conflict.
            Crest was one of the many clone soldiers of Jango Fett created to fight for the Grand Army of the Republic. He survived the Clone Wars and continued serving the Empire.[2]
            Crest served as part of the personal stormtrooper contingent accompanying Darth Vader and Wilhuff Tarkin on an investigative trip to Murkhana. At the time, he held the rank of sergeant. Crest accompanied Vader and Tarkin as they investigated a building which held former Separatist contraband. However, as they were did so, their vessel, the Carrion Spike, was hijacked. The guards and two crewmen aboard were killed, and Vader was angry at Crest for allowing such a thing to happen. To get a new vessel, Vader and Tarkin intimidated a local Sugi crime boss to give up his ship to them by threatening to destroy his warehouse with his family inside. The sergeant and his troopers took control of the warehouse, and later secured the crime lord's ship when he gave into the pressure and gave it up to the Imperials.[2]
            When they pursued the Carrion Spike aboard the crime lord's ship, Crest and his troopers served as gunners. Despite their efforts, the unit failed to halt the Spike's multiple attacks on Imperial installations, and eventually stayed aboard the Liberator, a Venator-class Star Destroyer. By that point, only Crest and six troopers remained of Vader's original contingent that was on Murkhana. Later, they met up with a task force led by the Executrix, an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, which Tarkin appropriated as his flagship. Crest, having been promoted to lieutenant by Vader in a rare reconsideration of his past failings, was present with the Dark Lord aboard a picket ship. Their planned ambush for the Spike failed, however. He later reported to Vader and Tarkin on the capture of a freighter during the ambush, which he presumed had links with the hijackers of the Spike.[2]
            Later, Lieutenant Crest accompanied Vader aboard the Conquest, a Secutor-class Star Destroyer, which served as the command vessel of Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit. Vader told Rancit he knew that it was he who was the traitor that provided aid to those who stole the Spike, and provided them with information to carry out attacks on Imperial targets. Vader ordered Crest and his men to lock Rancit in an escape pod and launch it out to a safe distance; whereon the treacherous admiral was forced to give the fleet a fire order that destroyed him for his disloyalty.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Crest</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCrest</string></dict>
        <key>Delak Krennel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.624.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Delak Krennel was a Human male who served as an Imperial admiral-turned-warlord in the years following Emperor Palpatine's death.
            Krennel was a muscular male Human with a cybernetic replacement from the elbow down on his right arm to replace a loss during battle with another Imperial warlord's forces. The replacement glowed red when Krennel would use it in a way that would normally require muscle use, a feature that instilled fear in his subordinates.
            Krennel was born on Corulag. At a young age, he demonstrated the firm Humanocentrism as well as the sadism and penchant for brutality that would mark his later career when he helped his father burn down alien-owned farmlands so they could be seized by a Human agro-combine.
            He began his Imperial service when he joined the Prefsbelt IV Naval Academy. His academy record was relatively undistinguished, except for several prizes as an intramural unarmed combat champion (in later years, Krennel still kept himself in fighting trim, and his abilities were only enhanced by his mechanical arm).
            Upon graduation, Krennel rose through the ranks and was eventually assigned to Thrawn's Unknown Regions armada, as a captain in command of the Reckoning. However, the assignment was in actuality exile imposed by his then-commanding officer, Grand Admiral Rufaan Tigellinus (who also had Thrawn exiled largely for his Chiss heritage), due to Krennel's brutality being extreme even for the Empire. Krennel resented serving beneath a nonhuman officer, as well as his post at the Unknown Regions, but could not voice his frustrations to Thrawn, so he instead used his rage to escalate his brutal nature on the alien prisoners. Eventually, Krennel's anger towards Thrawn had him decide to use a Vibropike against one of Thrawn's artworks, in mockery of his superior's tendency to utilize alien artwork to exploit an alien race's weakness during battle. This resulted in Thrawn ordering one of his Noghri Death Commandos to cut his arm off from the elbow down before he could damage it, leading to his gaining a prosthetic afterwards. This event gave him a new respect and fear of Thrawn, proceeding to rise to the rank of Admiral. Eventually, he chose to disobey an order to subjugate a world. Instead, Krennel chose to pacify it via bombardment, a choice that saw him recalled to Coruscant for a personal punishment from Palpatine. Before Palpatine could deliver his judgment, he perished at Endor. In the chaos that followed, Krennel fled the fleet and styled himself as a warlord, with the title of "Prince-Admiral", in the ensuing Imperial Civil War.
            Early in the conflict, Krennel aligned with General Paltr Carvin, but accepted orders from the burgeoning authority of Ysanne Isard. On Isard's orders, Krennel attempted to capture Leia Organa on Axxila, but was stopped by an AT3 Directive issued by Soontir Fel at the behest of Sate Pestage. The interruption irked Krennel, causing him to offer his allegiance directly to Isard in exchange for aid in retrieving Pestage on Ciutric IV. When Pestage escaped the New Republic, he sought asylum with Krennel, unaware of his hatred for the Grand Vizier. Krennel strangled Pestage and seized his holdings in the Ciutric Hegemony, before coldly murdering Pestage's entire family.
            During Thrawn's campaign, Krennel offered monetary support and pretended to pay heed to his former commander's call for unity. After the defeat of Thrawn at Bilbringi, Krennel was targeted to be an example to warlords of the New Republic's newly strengthened policy against them.
            With the clone Isard, Krennel began a plot to sow chaos in the New Republic between Human and nonhuman species, waylay freight traffic to Coruscant at Liinade III, and conquer Coruscant. Rogue Squadron put their plans to a quick end, with the aid of the original Ysanne Isard. Wedge Antilles forwarded intelligence provided by Isard to the New Republic Defense Fleet, which dispatched a flotilla to Ciutric before Krennel's forces could launch their attack. The flotilla, under the command of Admiral Gial Ackbar crushed Krennel's forces in a Thrawn Pincer and seized the shield-stripped capital of the Hegemony. Krennel died aboard his flagship, Reckoning, when a concussion missile launched from either the Selonian Fire or Corusca Fire pierced the forward viewport, shattering the viewport and sending shards of transparisteel through Krennel's body. When the missile exploded, Krennel and the entire bridge were destroyed.
            Krennel was a competent tactician and strategist (as evidenced by his promotion to Imperial Admiral), but he was a brutal man by nature and had little tolerance for the subtler approaches espoused by two of his old superiors, Thrawn and Isard. His reflexive response to any obstacle was to crush it.
            He was very sadistic, as well as masochistic, the latter trait being adopted shortly after he lost his arm to Thrawn when trying to damage one of his artworks.
            During his brief tutelage by Isard's clone as ruler of the Citruic Hegemony, he began to experiment with political propaganda and other means of manipulating opinion in his favor, presenting himself as a sympathetic ruler rather than a tyrant. He started to see the effectiveness of these methods and flattered himself that he was a quick learner and would soon be able to master them without "Isard's" help. His death in battle cut short any promise he might have shown.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Delak_Krennel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDelakKrennel</string></dict>
        <key>Orson Callan Krennic</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.625.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Orson Callan Krennic was a human male who served as Director of the Advanced Weapons Research division of the Imperial Security Bureau and served as the commander of the Death Star up to the beginning of the Galactic Civil War. Beginning his career as a Lieutenant Commander in the Galactic Republic, Krennic was promoted to commander and later the fleet equivalence of admiral upon formation of the Galactic Empire. Persistent and ambitious, Krennic was responsible for the development and construction of the Empire's enormous Death Star superweapon. An old friend of crystallographer Galen Erso, Krennic manipulated the brilliant scientist into researching synthetic kyber crystals under the pretext of researching sustainable energy. In reality, Krennic weaponized Erso's crystal research for the battle station's planet-killing superlaser, hoping this would place him above his long-time rival Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and win the favor of the Emperor. Krennic was also held accountable for security of the project, quelling rumors of the Empire's secret enterprise for the several decades of its assembly. For these many purposes he commanded a squad of death troopers, serving as both a sword and shield when the Director found himself in battle.
            During the final stages of the Death Star's construction, the project faced potential exposure in the form of a talkative cargo pilot. Krennic restlessly sought to silence these rumors, ordering the first successful discharge of the superlaser on the sacred moon of Jedha, where news of the technological terror had reached. However, Krennic was ultimately unable to contain the project's secrecy, and the Rebel Alliance soon launched an attack on the coastal planet Scarif where data tapes containing a complete technical readout of the station were being held. After Director Krennic failed to prevent the theft of these tapes, Tarkin deployed the Death Star in a continued effort to eliminate the compromised facility. Krennic met his end in this second blast of his own creation, an ironic culmination of his life's work. Soon afterwards, the Rebellion successfully exploited a vulnerability in the Death Star discovered through the stolen plans, detonating the reactor module and leading to the downfall of Krennic's achievement.
            Orson Callan Krennic was a human male born in Sativran City on the planet Lexrul in the year 51 BBY. At the age of fifteen, he earned a place in the Galactic Republic's Future Program on Brentaal, wherein he met and befriended fellow student Galen Erso. The two worked well together, but the older Erso shrank in the shadow of Krennic's personality and charisma. Although Krennic's listed area of excellence was architecture, his counselors noted that Krennic's ability to manipulate and read others was just as effective.[1] After a time in the program, he was offered a position in the Republic Corps of Engineers and joined it, which led to him supervising large onworld and deep space construction projects. This increased influence allowed Krennic to land Erso a visiting professorship at the Institute of Applied Science[3] at the time when Erso had focused on kyber crystal research.[1]
            Krennic grew to become a member of the Republic's Strategic Advisory Cell, and, despite publicly still being represented as a member of the Corps of Engineers, only those within the cell were aware of Krennic's involvement as a member of the top-secret Republic Special Weapons Group. As part of this group, Krennic returned to studying, particularly in regards to the weapons Rothana, Kuat and others had built for the Grand Army, and Baktoid, Hoersch-Kessel Drive and others were engineering for the Separatists.[3]
            At a meeting discussing the schematics for the Death Star obtained by the Republic sometime following the Second Battle of Geonosis, it was argued whether the Republic could create such a weapon before the Separatists were able to—a basic ring structure had already been completed, however, problems arose when it came to the labor force responsible for its construction, as well as the superweapon that would give the station its devastating power. Krennic met with Vice Chancellor Mas Amedda to discuss the weapon, within which Krennic suggested using the work of his former colleague Galen Erso. Erso had been focusing his research on how crystals could be used to supply power, and had most recently focused on kyber crystals. Erso was currently imprisoned by the Separatists on Vallt, but Krennic believed that the research could be weaponized. Amedda agreed to letting Krennic arrange for his rescue, yet Krennic had to do so without making the Republic's involvement clear.[3]
            Krennic enlisted the help of smuggler Has Obitt to travel to the planet of Merj, where they and a team of other smugglers captured two Separatist Morseerian scientists. Going to Vallt disguised as employees of Zerpen Industries, the company that Galen Erso belonged to, Krennic arranged for the two scientists to be received by the Separatists in exchange for Galen, Lyra and their daughter Jyn Erso. Upon making their way off the planet, they were intercepted by a Separatist warship. Krennic called for assistance from Commander Prakas, who arrived in a Republic cruiser and opened fire on Vallt, destroying the Keep where the Ersos had been kept, much to their distaste. In an attempt to persuade Galen to leave his strictly pacifist ways, Krennic took them to Galen's home planet of Grange, which had come under siege. Galen, however, maintained his resolve to stay neutral in the Clone War: Despite his fierce desire for the engineer's knowledge and talents, Krennic knew that Galen would have to mostly come to his own decision based on knowledge as opposed to being quickly and simply persuaded.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Orson_Callan_Krennic</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascOrsonCallanKrennic</string></dict>

        <key>Darth Krayt</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.627.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Krayt, born A'Sharad Hett, was a Human male who served as a Jedi Master in the waning days of the Galactic Republic. The son of legendary Jedi Knight Sharad Hett and his wife K'Sheek, both of whom lived among the Tusken Raiders of Tatooine, he eventually became the Padawan of Jedi Masters Ki-Adi-Mundi, and later, An'ya Kuro. When he was only a teen, Hett's father was murdered by the Jedi assassin Aurra Sing, who was later defeated in a duel by a young A'Sharad Hett. During the Clone Wars, he served the Republic as a General and established himself as a charismatic leader who often led his troops from the front. He eventually became friends with the young Anakin Skywalker and helped Anakin come to terms with the destruction which had been wrought by the galaxy-wide war. A'Sharad took part in key conflicts during the war such as the Battle of Boz Pity and Siege of Saleucami. He managed to survive the Clone Wars, and was one of the few Jedi known to have escaped the Great Jedi Purge in 19 BBY.
            A'Sharad Hett eventually made his way back to his homeworld of Tatooine where he vowed to wage a private war against the new Galactic Empire. However, after a confrontation with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, he was exiled from Tatooine and later discovered that it was Anakin Skywalker who became the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who he had aided in the annihilation of the Jedi Order. A'Sharad blamed himself for the destruction of the Jedi Order and became a bounty hunter. During one of his missions, he found himself on Korriban, where he trained as a Sith under the tutelage of the Dark Lord XoXaan. Hett eventually fell to the dark side after capture and torture by the Yuuzhan Vong and soon proclaimed himself Dread Lord and Dark Lord of the Sith, taking the name "Darth Krayt".
            As Krayt, he became the founder and leader of the One Sith. He rebuilt the Sith Order and kept its existence hidden from the Jedi by cloaking their presence on Korriban. To survive, the Dark Lord spent many years in stasis before reemerging to form an alliance with Moff Nyna Calixte and to spark the Sith–Imperial War that led to the destruction of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. At the climax of the war, he deposed Emperor Roan Fel and brought about the destruction of the New Jedi Order.
            Darth Krayt ruled the galaxy with an iron fist for seven years before the alliance between rightful Emperor Roan Fel and Galactic Alliance admiral Gar Stazi threatened his usurped rule. Furthermore, Krayt discovered the existence and survival of a Skywalker: Cade. Krayt feared that with these deteriorating conditions and his bad health would lead to his demise before his dream was finished, and sent about the hunt for Cade Skywalker. However, during a skirmish on Had Abbadon, Krayt was stabbed and sent hurtling off a cliff. The Sith Lord's powers proved strong, however, when they saved his life. Darth Krayt was then approached by Darth Wyyrlok, his most trusted advisor, who presumably murdered Krayt, believing the Dread Lord would lead to the Sith Order's destruction.
            But, even as he was inactive, Krayt's ideals were being carried out by Wyyrlok in his place. Krayt later healed his body from his near-death experience. Overcoming the taint of his armor, he called out to all those across the galaxy who had touched the dark side, signaling his return. With the aid of loyal Sith and a new breed of Sith troopers, Krayt retook Coruscant, slaying Darth Wyyrlok in the process, and began making preparations to rebirth the galaxy through war. However, in the final battle, he once again attempted to turn Cade Skywalker. He failed to do so, which allowed Cade to permanently kill him.
            A'Sharad was born on the desert planet of Tatooine, the son of the famed Ex-Jedi Knight Sharad Hett and a Tusken-raised Human woman named K'Sheek.[1]
            From his earliest days A'Sharad was raised, not only in the ways of the Jedi, but also among the traditions of the nomadic Sand People of his homeworld. He once undertook the ritual of slaying a krayt dragon. While he had grown up informally learning the ways of the Force and lightsaber construction from his father, A'Sharad's formal Jedi training did not begin until shortly after a Hutt-provoked Tusken war designed to increase demand for old weapons, in which the bounty hunter Aurra Sing murdered his father. At this time A'Sharad was fifteen years old, and upon his father's death he gained possession of his father's lightsaber, which A'Sharad continued to use even after constructing his own. He would eventually become a skilled Jar'Kai user.[1]
            Following his father's death, he was initially taken as the Padawan of Ki-Adi-Mundi, and under the Cerean Jedi Master's watchful eye he partook in a mission to the planet of Malastare. On this mission he worked alongside various members of the Jedi Council, which included Adi Gallia, his own master, Yaddle, Mace Windu, and Even Piell. The mission itself was launched in response to the insurgents of the planet Lannik who declared that they were finally willing to begin peace talks to end the civil war on their planet—the location for the peace meeting was none other than Malastare.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Krayt</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthKrayt</string></dict>

A scion of House Kryze, Korkie was born into the Mandalorian political family of his aunt, Duchess Satine Kryze—leader of the New Mandalorians. As civil war spread across the galaxy, fought between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Korkie endeavored to follow in his aunt's career as a leader for the next generation of Mandalore. Though the Mandalorian black market conspiracy was exposed by Korkie and his friends, resulting in the arrest of Prime Minister Almec, the future that he had been groomed for was disrupted by the Death Watch takeover of Mandalore.
            Korkie Kryze was born with a promising future in politics,[1] having been sired by House Kryze—a powerful house in Mandalorian society.[3] As the nephew of Duchess Satine Kryze, leader of the New Mandalorian faction, Korkie followed his aunt's direction by training to become a future leader at the Royal Academy of Government in Sundari, the capital city of Mandalore. Amongst the student body, he counted fellow cadets Amis, Lagos, and Soniee as his friends.[1]
            During the Clone Wars, Kryze and his classmates were present for a lecture on the correlation of politics and corruption delivered by Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, a guest speaker sent to the Mandalorian homeworld by the High Council of the Jedi Order. Inspired by Tano's teachings, Kryze convinced his friends to follow him as he investigated the shortage of supplies in the capital.[2] However, their search ultimately led them to discover evidence of corruption at the highest level of the Mandalorian government.[1] As a result, they were drawn into Tano's own investigation which revealed that Prime Minister Almec had conspired to increase the planet's trade connections through the black market system.[2] Due to their intervention,[1] Almec was removed from office and sent to prison in light of his illegal operation.[2]
            As the war progressed throughout the galaxy between the the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Duchess Satine's government was toppled by the Death Watch splinter group and their allies in the Shadow Collective. The Duchess herself was made a prisoner of the new regime, now led by the former Sith apprentice Darth Maul, which caused Korkie and his old classmates to attempt a jail break in order to free his imprisoned aunt. His plan was supported by his aunt's sister, Bo-Katan Kryze, who led the Nite Owls in opposition to Maul's leadership. In spite of their efforts, however, Korkie failed to complete the rescue mission. Duchess Satine was recaptured by the Mandalorian super commandos and subsequently executed by Maul, all while Mandalore divided between opposing factions in a new civil war.[5]
            As a young Mandalorian with a pedigree in the political establishment, Korkie Kryze spent his formative years in preparation for a career in public service.[1] In his time, he represented the best and brightest of his generation,[6] having served as a cadet at the prestigious Royal Academy of Government[1] where Mandalore's future leaders were trained.[6] In addition to the political clout of his family, Kryze's keen intuition and ambitious drive were indicative of his potential to succeed as a future leader on Mandalore.[1]
            As the nephew of Duchess Satine Kryze, Korkie shared a close relationship with his aunt whom he affectionately referred to as "Auntie Satine."[5] Upon learning of Almec's betrayal, Korkie sought to protect his aunt and sovereign from the Prime Minister.[2] After Death Watch established their control on Mandalore, Korkie remained loyal to his aunt—declaring that he could never betray her.[5]
            Kryze was a human male who stood at 1.65 meters.[1] He had blond hair, blue eyes, and light skin.[5]
            Korie Kryze was first introduced in The Academy, the sixth episode in Season Three of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. He was portrayed by voice actor Whit Hertford, who reprised the role in the fifth season episode The Lawless.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korkie_Kryze</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKorkieKryze</string></dict>

        <key>Qorl</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.634.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Qorl was a TIE Fighter pilot stationed on the first Death Star, who was shot down during the Battle of Yavin. Crashing on Yavin 4, he managed to repair his fighter and participated in a small skirmish the next day. He encountered Luke Skywalker above Yavin and tried to shoot him down, but Luke cut into his ship, forcing Qorl to crash. After the brief brawl with the Rebel on the surface, Qorl lost consciousness but was left alive.
            He eked out an existence in the jungle, until encountering the Solo children and other Jedi trainees 23 years later. After successfully escaping the moon, he linked up with the Second Imperium splinter movement, training their pilots and leading an assault on the jungle moon.
            Shot down a second time, Qorl returned to the jungle where he would live undisturbed until the Yuuzhan Vong War once again brought him into contact with a Solo, this time Anakin. Together they escaped the moon.
            Qorl was a TIE Fighter pilot serving in the Imperial forces assigned to the first Death Star, with the designation CE3K-1977. During the Battle of Yavin, Qorl flew with his squadron against the Rebel forces. According to the account Qorl gave to Jacen and Jaina Solo in 23 ABY, all TIE squadrons on the Death Star were launched during the battle. This statement is at odds with evidence presented by Wedge Antilles and others, indicating that only Darth Vader's elite escort unit Black Squadron saw action during the battle. Taking all the evidence into account, it seems most likely that Qorl was a pilot from Black Squadron.
            One of the solar panels of Qorl's TIE Fighter was badly damaged by X-wing defensive fire, sending his fighter spinning out of control. Qorl found his fighter's orbit was decaying, sending the fighter spinning towards the fourth moon of Yavin. His controllers instructed him to make an emergency landing on Yavin and await rescue. Qorl managed a controlled crash that threw him from his fighter, left him with broken bones in his left arm.
            Shortly after his crash-landing, Qorl witnessed the Death Star explode in the sky. It would be the last he would see of the Imperial forces for over twenty years.
            Qorl, however managed to repair his fighter and the day after the Battle of Yavin he flew out of the jungle. There he saw a Rebel X-wing and attacked it. After the brief firefight both Qorl's TIE fighter and the X-wing were badly damaged after the X-wing pilot cut into Qorl's ship. Both ships soon crashed into the swamp, but their pilots survived. Qorl attacked the Rebel with a blaster, but was soon defeated in a brawl and lost his weapon. Not willing to surrender, Qorl pushed his enemy into a swamp and the fight continued there. Since Qorl was wearing his flight suit that allowed him to breath underwater, he soon gained the upper hand in a fight. But when the Rebel ripped out his air hose, Qorl started to drown in his own helmet and soon lost consciousness. However, the Rebel rescued him and left him alive. Little did Qorl know that the Rebel was Luke Skywalker, the man who destroyed the Death Star.
            Despite his injuries, Qorl managed to survive in the moon's jungles, obeying his last orders to remain near the crash and await rescue.
            In 23 ABY, Qorl's downed TIE Fighter was discovered by the Jedi trainees Lowbacca, Tenel Ka, Jacen Solo and Jaina Solo. Jaina eagerly seized the opportunity to dabble in mechanics, and with her friends' help, she set out to repair the damaged starfighter and fit it with an old hyperdrive. The hyperdrive unit was originally not in working condition, a present from Han Solo off an old Imperial Delta-class shuttle being dismantled on Coruscant. The young Jedi had no idea that the TIE's pilot had survived, but when Qorl discovered the Solo twins working on his craft, he saw an opportunity to escape. He decided to bide his time and wait for them to complete the repairs while he kept an eye on their progress.
            The repairs to the fighter were almost complete when Jacen, scavenging for wreckage in the jungle around the crash-site, stumbled upon the hollowed-out tree that had been Qorl's home for the past 20 years. The old pilot responded by kidnapping Jacen and Jaina at blaster-point, and trying to kill Lowbacca and Tenel Ka as they fled.
            Qorl forced his prisoners to finish the repairs to his fighter, and in the meantime, he learned from them of the events of the last twenty-three years, including the downfall of the Empire at Endor and the fact that in the wake of the peace between the New Republic and the remnants of the Empire, there were still a few loyal holdouts left in the Deep Core.
            When the repairs were complete, Qorl attempted to destroy the Great Temple, but he was unsuccessful because while the laser cannons were physically fine, Jaina hadn't hooked them up, but she did jury-rig the readouts so that the weapons systems looked normal. Completely defenseless, he managed to escape the weapons fire and break out from the tractor beam of the Millennium Falcon, earning Han's reluctant admiration for his piloting skills. Engaging the hyperdrive moments after leaving the atmosphere, he left the Yavin system for the Deep Core and found the Shadow Academy, run by the Dark Jedi Brakiss. Qorl gave his report, noting his encounter with the Solo twins. Brakiss extrapolated from this that Luke Skywalker was now training a new generation of Jedi, who could be more easily indoctrinated into following the dark side of the Force than the adults who he had trained with during his brief stay at the Jedi Praxeum.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Qorl</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascQorl</string></dict>

        <key>Bandwin Cor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.636.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bandwin Cor was a human male who served as a Colonel in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the lead-up to the Galactic Civil War. He worked with the rebel pilots and gave them demerits for their misconducts. During the Galactic Civil War, he notably trained many pilots for the Alliance and he sacrificed himself during the attack on the Mako-Ta Space Docks as an attempt to free the pilots from their entrapment inside Mon Calamari
            Star Cruisers.
            Bandwin Cor served as a Colonel in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the lead-up to the Galactic Civil War. Shortly prior to Operation Buckler, Cor wrote an official report to General Jan Dodonna on whether Alliance Starfighter Command should use X-wing starfighters as its backbone. Cor also mentioned in the report that General Antoc Merrick and Commander Garven Dreis agreed, and also wrote on some advantages of having the X-wing as the primary starfighter of Starfighter Command. Cor finished the report by confirming that supplemental materials would follow which would hopefully persuade the accountants. Cor's report was later included in The Rebel Files.[3]
            During Operation Handoff when Senator Mon Mothma fled to Dantooine with the help of the Spectres and Gold Squadron, she created a report that detailed several members of Alliance High Command, which included Cor and was later added to The Rebel Files. Sometime following the Vulpter data raid and the establishment of Base One on Yavin 4, Cor created a flight patrol schedule to patrol the area around Yavin and the Gordian Trace Relays. Cor was part of a subsequent report on the UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft composed by General Merrick in which Merrick stated that both Cor and General Dodonna approved his evaluation of the UT-60D. Both reports were also added to The Rebel Files.[3]
            Although General Antoc Merrick was in charge of the Starfighter Command, Merrick deferred to Colonel Cor for day-to-day decisions. Cor worked closely with General Jan Dodonna for the most efficient utilization of starfighter resources in the Gordian Reach–the sector that encompassed Yavin.[2] Early in the rebellion, Cor was capable of issuing demerits to his pilots for infractions, such as a messy ready room in Base One.[4]
            Shortly after the Eadu Flight Station was destroyed the Alliance High Command held a meeting on the recently confirmed superweapon, known as the Death Star. Cor attended the meeting and watched as individuals such as Jyn Erso and Admiral Raddus campaigned for an attack on the Scarif vault to obtain the plans for the Death Star. However, with much opposition, the high command could not go through with the plan. After Cor and the others left, Erso took matters into her own hands and led a strike team to attack the vault on Scarif. Raddus soon followed with a large portion of the Alliance Fleet and although they were successful, it led to the deaths of Erso, Raddus, Merrick and many others.[5]
            After the Battle of Scarif and the start of the Galactic Civil War, Cor was in the war room of Base One along with General Dodonna, General Vanden Willard, Princess Leia Organa, and others directing the attack against the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin. Cor's statement during the battle that Red Squadron and Gold Squadron were en route and nearing visual range of the Death Star was included in a partial transcript of conversations in the war room, and was added in The Rebel Files. During the evacuation of Yavin 4, Lieutenant Wedge Antilles wrote a patrol report of a flight conducted by Snoop 2, a Patrol X-wing, to Colonel Cor of Yavin's perimeter. The report was included in The Rebel Files.[3]
            During the Galactic Civil War he trained up many rebel pilots for the Alliance.[1] He later attended a meeting at the Mako-Ta Space Docks, held by Mon Mothma, on the Alliance's plan to obtain more Mon Calamari Star Cruisers. There, Cor stood between General's Davits Draven and Jan Dodonna and they watched as Princess Leia Organa addressed her plan for to prompt mutiny of Mon Cala's merchant fleet. Mothma approved of this[6] and Organa was soon successful, obtaining many cruisers for the Alliance.[7] The cruisers were outfitted for war with mainly Shu-Torun technology and soon after, a party was held to celebrate this. However, when their new fleet prepared to scatter, their hyperdrives failed to respond as the Shu-Torun technology had been sabotaged by it's queen, Trios. Darth Vader's Death Squadron then arrived and began attacking the cruisers, destroyed General Vanden Willard's cruiser first.[8]
            Organa and Cor, who was now a General himself, led a strike team to board Trios' ship before it could escape. They engaged her soldiers and Cor pulled Organa back as a shot almost hit her, saying she was too valuable to lose. Organa replied that everyone was too valuable to lose and that everyone was dying. They soon sent the Shu-Torun soldiers running and they made for the bridge, where Trios was. They made it to the bridge and started gunning down the soldiers. Organa spotted Trios running away and tried to go for her. Cor told her to stay back as the gunfight ensued but Organa said it was the only choice and ran for Trios. The gunfight soon drew to a close and Cor and Draven began looking through the ships database for a way to get the cruisers moving again. Organa returned after failing to catch Trios and Draven discovered that if they flew something at the cruiser's hanger doors, they could open and free the starfighters from their entrapment. Cor volunteered to take a shuttle out there as he had trained many of those pilots and he flew it through the fighting towards the cruisers. However, TIE fighters soon intercepted him and the slowness of his shuttle meant he could evade them. Cor's ship exploded into a fireball before long.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bandwin_Cor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBandwinCor</string></dict>
        <key>Conan Antonio Motti</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.637.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Conan Antonio Motti was the Chief of the Imperial Navy who held the rank of admiral aboard the Death Star during the Galactic Civil War. Motti was extremely confident in his viewpoint that the Death Star was invulnerable, believing that the Rebel Alliance posed no threat to the battle station. He was even bold and arrogant enough to openly question Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader for his failure to discover the location of the Rebellion's secret base during one meeting in the Death Star. For this, Vader Force choked him. Despite Motti's unshakable faith in the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance—which had obtained a copy of the Death Star blueprints—managed to find a weak spot in the station's defenses, and succeeded in destroying it during a battle above the Death Star, killing Motti.
            Conan Antonio Motti was a human male who hailed from a wealthy and powerful family in the Outer Rim. A native of Seswenna, Motti became an officer in the Imperial Navy, eventually rising to the rank of Rear Admiral, commanding the Star Destroyer Steel Talon.[1][6] In 14 BBY,[2] he was a member of the Joint Chiefs. By this time, he was considered by Emperor Sheev Palpatine to be a potential candidate for the newly-created position of Grand Moff. However, this position eventually went to Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who played a major part in a plot to destroy several Imperial space stations. However, Motti was involved in the campaign, being a part of several meetings of the Joint Chiefs at Imperial Center. Due to this, he received a promotion from the Emperor.[7]
            By 0 BBY,[2] he was aboard the Death Star, a planet-destroying battle station, and served as not only an Admiral, but the Chief of the Imperial Navy, as well remaining a Joint Chief.[1][6] When the Alliance to Restore the Republic managed to obtain a copy of the technical readouts of the Death Star, the Rebel corvette carrying the stolen plans was captured by Darth Vader, but the plans themselves eluded the Dark Lord. During a meeting of high ranking Imperial staff aboard the station, he argued with General Cassio Tagge of the Imperial Army over the effectiveness of the Death Star and the threat of the Rebellion in the Galactic Civil War. Tagge felt that the Rebel Alliance posed a threat to the battle station, whereas Motti was confident that the superweapon was invincible. Tagge also feared that the growing Rebel movement would gain sympathy in the Imperial Senate. However, the two were interrupted by Grand Moff Tarkin, who informed the officers present that the Senate had been recently dissolved by the Emperor himself.[4]
            The regional governors would now have direct control over systems, and the planets would not dare step out of line due to fear of the Death Star. However, Tagge continued to insist that the Rebellion was dangerous, especially if they had obtained a copy of the Death Star plans. Though Darth Vader—who had recently arrived to interrogate Princess Leia Organa—admitted that the plans were in the hands of the Rebellion, he proclaimed that soon the Empire would have them. Motti then boasted of the Death Star's power, claiming that it was the preeminent power in the galaxy. However, Vader rebutted this claim, warning Motti not to underestimate the power of the Force. Arrogance clouding his judgment, Motti mocked Vader, insulting his devotion to the Force, alleging that it had not helped him recover the stolen Death Star plans or locate the Rebels' hidden base. In response, Vader simply Force choked him while rebuking him for his disturbing lack of faith, relenting only when ordered to do so by Tarkin but only at the very last moment. Motti slumped across the conference table, gasping for breath and considerably unnerved.[4]
            Motti later submitted a sharply worded incident report regarding the matter in which he stated that he would submit to discipline if necessary, but objected to Vader's attempt to proselytize him in his religion and stressing that it was important to take pride in this project that had taken so much of the Empire's time and effort.[8]
            When the Death Star arrived near Organa's home planet of Alderaan, Motti informed Tarkin prior to Vader's return with the Princess in his possession. Tarkin threatened to destroy the planet if she did not reveal the location of the Alliance's base, and Organa informed them that the base was on Dantooine. Tarkin then ordered the Death Star's superlaser to fire when ready, shocking the princess. He felt that this would be a demonstration that would terrify the rest of the galaxy—fear would keep dissidents in line. A group of Rebels managed to make it aboard the Death Star, and succeeded in freeing Organa from her cell. They then fled in their ship, the Millennium Falcon. Imperial stormtroopers had placed a tracking device aboard the starship earlier, however, and the Empire was able to track the freighter to the Rebel base on a moon of the planet Yavin, which was located in in the Outer Rim.[4]
            A battle began between the Imperial and Rebel forces above the Death Star. When several X-wing fighters proved adept at evading the station's defenses, Vader manned his personal TIE fighter and attacked them. He began picking off the surviving fighters one by one, but some officers nevertheless began to worry that the Rebel attack posed a danger. However, the Alliance was aware of a flaw in the Death Star—a small, uncovered thermal exhaust port leading directly to the station's main reactor. Against all odds, and much to Tarkin's surprise, a Rebel X-wing piloted by Luke Skywalker succeeded in flying through the trench where the exhaust port was located, and successfully fired a pair of proton torpedoes into the shaft, causing the Death Star to explode, instantly killing all those on board,[4] Motti included.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Conan_Antonio_Motti</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascConanAntonioMotti</string></dict>

            During his work for the Galactic Republic on Manaan, Nolan served as the chief scientist at the secret Hrakert Station on Manaan's ocean floor as of 3956 BBY. When it was overrun by insane Selkath he, along with Sami, was one of the few survivors that were saved by the amnesiac Revan during his search for the Star Map.
            Despite his position as a scientist for the Republic, Nolan was amoral, against believing the ethical consequences of his work. He advocated using an experimental poison to kill the Progenitor, and was furious when Revan, following Sami's advice, chose to destroy the facility instead.
            Kono Nolan was voiced by Cam Clarke.
            If the player takes the dark side path, he can have Revan poison the Progenitor and/or kill either or both of the scientists. The consequences of releasing the poison, however, are profound; Revan is then banned from returning to Manaan and the general price of medkits throughout the game goes up; alternately, if the dark-side player has enough skill in Persuade, Revan can revisit the planet, using his ability to convince the Selkath to keep the matter quiet.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kono_Nolan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKonoNolan</string></dict>

        <key>Kassius Konstantine</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.641.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kassius Konstantine was a human male from Coruscant who served as an Admiral in the Imperial Navy. He was dispatched to the Lothal system where a rebel movement occurred. After the Spectres joined the rebellion, Admiral Konstantine would continue to hunt them down under the command of Agent Kallus and the Inquisitor known as the Fifth Brother. Despite their efforts and superior resources, the rebels proved elusive for Konstantine and his comrades.
            Admiral Konstantine's failed attempts to stamp out the rebellion led Governor Arihnda Pryce to solicit the services of Grand Admiral Thrawn, a seasoned tactician and the commander of the Seventh Fleet. In an effort to test the Admiral's talents and capabilities, Thrawn dispatched Konstantine on a mission to destroy the Iron Squadron, a rebel cell based at Mykapo. Konstantine managed to trap the Squadron's captain, Mart Mattin, but underestimated the ingenuity of the Spectres and Mart's uncle Commander Jun Sato. Konstantine was greatly embarrassed by this skirmish, and attempted to spin the incident in a positive way. However, Thrawn saw through his obfuscation.
            Some time later, Konstantine, commanding an Interdictor vessel, accompanied Thrawn and Pryce at the Battle of Atollon. Consumed by his arrogance and jealousy, Konstantine pursued the Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier Phoenix Nest, defying Thrawn's direct orders of holding back. This maneuver cost Konstantine his life as Commander Sato rammed the Phoenix Home into the Interdictor, destroying both cruisers.
            In the years before the Battle of Yavin, Kassius Konstantine commanded the Lothal sector fleet from his flagship, the Imperial Star Destroyer Relentless. He aided the Inquisitor in his search for the Ghost, a rebel starship.[3] After the Spectres rescued another fugitive, the Rodian Imperial Information Office staffer Tseebo, and breached the Imperial security cordon around the planet Lothal's Capital City, Konstantine commanded the Relentless in the pursuit of the rebels. With Tseebo's help, the rebels escaped into hyperspace. While Konstantine thought of shifting the blame for the rebels' escape to the Inquisitor, he declined since the Sith agent had succeeded in planting a tracking device onto the hull of the Ghost.[5]
            When Admiral Konstantine reported that they were receiving a signal from the tracker, the Inquisitor did not acknowledge his presence but merely commented that he himself could sense the Jedi Kanan Jarrus and his Padawan Ezra Bridger. In response to the Inquisitor's comments, Konstantine stifled a laugh, as he believed that the Empire had wiped out the Jedi years ago during the Jedi Purge. He was personally skeptical of reports that the leader of that rebel cell was a Jedi. However, the Inquisitor read his emotions and scowled back at the Admiral. Fearing that his long and storied career would end if he failed to capture the rebels, he vowed that they would succeed.[5]
            Meanwhile, the Spectres realized that there was a tracking device planted onto the Ghost's auxiliary vessel, the Phantom. To prevent the Imperials from capturing Tseebo, Kanan and Ezra separated from the Ghost and flew the Phantom to the asteroid PM-1203, which hosted a former Republic base called Fort Anaxes. As planned, the Imperials took the bait. When Admiral Konstantine ordered that the Relentless land an entire battalion on that asteroid, the Inquisitor countermanded his orders and instead led a small contingent of stormtroopers to the PM-1203. The Inquisitor's troops were quickly dispatched by fyrnocks, fearsome predators that resided in the asteroid. Despite the Inquisitor's lightsaber skills and Force powers, Kanan and Ezra managed to escape; leaving both the Inquisitor and Admiral Konstantine empty-handed.[5]
            Admiral Konstantine was at the helm of his Star Destroyer Relentless when one of his crew took an interest in a VCX-100 light freighter approaching Lothal. This freighter turned out to be the rebel ship Ghost. However, the Spectres managed to fool the scanning technician and Konstantine by using a signature modulator to disguise the Ghost as the Tontine; a legitimate vessel traveling between Boz Pity and Lothal. The Ghost was transporting the "galactic entrepreneur" Lando Calrissian, who was trying to smuggle a puffer pig onto Lothal for an illegal mining operation. The rebels almost made it through the blockade undetected until Ezra accidentally disturbed the puffer pig; causing it to throw Garazeb Orrelios off balance onto the ship's control console. This effectively deactivated the signature modulator and exposed the Ghost to the Imperial authorities. Konstantine then dispatched four TIE/ln space superiority starfighters after the Ghost, but the rebels managed to lose their Imperial pursuers in Lothal's cloudy skies.[6]
            After the Inquisitor captured the rebel Jedi Kanan Jarrus sometime later, Konstantine was temporarily reassigned to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's flagship, the Sovereign, while over the planet Mustafar. After a lightsaber duel between Jarrus and the Inquisitor destroyed the Sovereign, Konstantine took part in the blockade of Lothal intended to ensnare the Spectres. He was unsuccessful in this, however, as the rebels managed to evade capture again by deploying masking transponders emitting false signals, allowing them to escape in their stolen Sentinel-class landing craft. Shortly afterwards, Konstantine and the Relentless were part of the surprise attack on the Phoenix Cell, led by Sith Lord Darth Vader, who was piloting a TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. As the Ghost made its escape, Konstantine activated his Destroyer's tractor beam to attempt to catch them, however, he instead ended up catching Vader as the rebels jumped to hyperspace. Knowing that his life was in danger for this mistake, Konstantine blamed his failure on a subordinate bridge officer.

        <key>Kligson</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.646.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kligson was a Human cyborg who was a veteran of the Clone Wars.
            Kligson was born on Sucharme, a farm world in the Outer Rim Territories’s Grohl sector with a long history with the Trade Federation. Kligson, always an imposing man with the T-square cheekbones of a holo idol, found his place in the society as a member of the Grohl Sector Defense Force. Soon, he ascended to the rank of major fighting pirate nests that had preyed on shipping in Grohl’s rimward reaches and intervened to end the civil war on nearby Ostega.[1]
            However, in the years immediately before the Battle of Naboo, the Federation began to become hostile to the people of Sucharme. After taking control of the planet's agricorps, the planet became only a supplier of raw materials for shipment to other Federation worlds. When the Sucharmese revolted, the Federation sent their Droid Army disguised as a "measured intervention to ensure collection of outstanding debt." The Grohl Sector Defense Force, including Major Kligson, intervened on Sucharme's behalf.
            After repelling the droids that Kligson came to hate, he renounced his commission and with others founded the Grohl Liberation Front, a group created to sabotage Federation interests all across the sector.[1]
            During the Separatist Crisis, Jango Fett was so impressed by the qualities of Kligson that he recruited him to the Cuy'val Dar. At the start of the Clone Wars Kligson, hoping to destroy more Separatist droids, left Kamino to become a rare non-clone officer in the Grand Army of the Republic, fighting ably on war-torn worlds such as Sluis Van and Praesitlyn.[1]
            At the end of the war, the clone troopers become stormtroopers and Kligson was a captain in the Imperial Army; but it all came to an end when he and his unit were sent to Sucharme. Here, he discovered that his orders were to kill his old comrades and nationalize the planet's resources. Kligson tried to stop this, but his own troops gunned him down. Not one of the men he’d trained and fought beside even hesitated. However, Kligson's old friends in the Grohl Liberation Front ambushed the Imperials and found him; but to save his life Kligson was forced to become a cyborg – one, ironically, made out of super battle droid parts.[1]
            At the Ostega Orbital Yards, Kligson used remnants of Confederacy of Independent Systems warships to build a demented-looking but formidable space station out of warship parts, which was derisively dubbed Kligson's Moon. Though he led guerrilla actions against the Galactic Empire for a time, his spirit was broken and his actions were erratic. He distanced himself from his comrades, interacting only with droids. One day, Kligson’s Moon fired up its engines and jumped into hyperspace.[1]
            In the years to follow Kligson's Moon — sometimes called Droid World — become a tale passed around by spacers in cantinas and by droid researchers in their labs. Soon, travelers began to seek out the space station to speak to its hermit captain. Kligson had only two rules: No organics were allowed to approach, and he had no interest in what he saw as a pointless struggle between Empire and rebellion. A few people succeeded in speaking to Kligson, by bringing him a new challenge in droid design. The Ingoian droid researcher Simonelle, who was said to have created a new Human-replica droid robotic body for Kligson, was one such person.[1]
            During the time of Palpatine's New Order, Kligson remained hidden from most people, though certain members of the Rebel Alliance had heard of him.
            Luke Skywalker contacted Kligson on behalf of the Rebel Alliance after encountering his floating space station. The leader of Droid World was unwilling to meet with a Human until Skywalker stated that he wished for Kligson's help in studying an Imperial warbot. An intrigued Kligson agreed to help, but stated that he would not allow a Human onboard his space station, and that if he repaired the warbot, he would keep it. Skywalker agreed to this, after which he sent R2-D2 and C-3PO aboard to observe the repair process.
            It was during this time that Kligon's assistant droid, Z-X3, attempted to take control of Kligson's Moon. As part of his rebellion, Z-X3 attempted to kill Kligson, but instead destroyed his droid duplicate. This provided Kligson with proof of Z-X3's Imperial allegiance, and he built an army to combat the traitorous droid's insurrection. The ensuing conflict devastated Droid World. Although Kligson emerged as the victor of the battle, he deeply lamented the loss of thousands of his droids. He then took his home into the Unknown Regions, seeking a safer haven far from galactic civilization.
            During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Kligson's moon came under attack by the invaders' ally, the Red Knights of Life. The Yuuzhan Vong were rabidly opposed to existence of any droid, so the space station was an ideal target for their religious hatred. The Iron Knights, Shard Jedi in droid bodies, came to Kligson's aid, however, and managed to repel the Red Knights, saving the moon from destruction.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kligson</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKligson</string></dict>
        <key>Derek Klivian</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.647.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Derek "Hobbie" Klivian, native to Ralltiir, was a longtime officer in Rogue Squadron and a well-respected pilot. As a young man, he attended Prefsbelt Fleet Camp with dreams of becoming an Imperial pilot. At the academy, he made friends with Biggs Darklighter, who persuaded him to oppose the Galactic Empire as tyrannical. When he graduated from Prefsbelt, Klivian was commissioned as executive officer aboard the Rand Ecliptic. There, he led a cell of mutineers that took over the ship, and he defected to the burgeoning Alliance to Restore the Republic with Darklighter. Klivian was ill when his best friend died in the Battle of Yavin, but afterward was recruited by Darklighter's childhood friend Luke Skywalker to join Rogue Squadron. Klivian served with distinction, fighting in the battles of Hoth and Endor, and earned a reputation as a skilled, if crash-prone, pilot and a notorious skeptic.
            When the Rebel Alliance became the New Republic, Derek Klivian continued serving until Rogue Squadron was disbanded. He then served with his close friend Wes Janson as a training officer for some time before rejoining the recommissioned Rogue Squadron under his longtime comrade Wedge Antilles after temporarily serving as Rogue Leader himself during the period when Antilles resigned. There he served for a dozen more years, battling various warlords and threats to the New Republic and serving as a vital part of the four-pilot delegation that brought Adumar into the New Republic. In 19 ABY, once peace with the Imperial Remnant had been reached, Klivian retired after approximately twenty years of service to the New Republic and Rebel Alliance.
            Derek Klivian was born on the prosperous Core World of Ralltiir and grew up under the rule of the Galactic Empire.[1] Early in life, he acquired the nickname "Hobbie" and used it almost exclusively in place of his given name, Derek.[4] An eager young man, Klivian applied to and was accepted by Prefsbelt Fleet Camp, an Imperial naval academy, seeking a glamorous and exciting life as a starfighter pilot.[3][11] He was not a political supporter or opponent of the Galactic Empire; he merely wanted a career as a pilot.[3] At Prefsbelt, he was instructed by Captain Soontir Fel, a highly skilled pilot.[11] Klivian was comfortable with the highly-automated process of flying the TIE fighters, for which many maneuvers were preprogrammed.[4] Despite this, neither he nor any of his classmates were ever able to beat Fel in the simulator, developing a healthy respect for their instructor in them.[12]
            He was classmates with Tycho Celchu and Biggs Darklighter, and befriended Darklighter.[3][11] The pair joined a broader circle of friends who questioned the Empire, and Klivian began to boast idly with them of overthrowing the Empire, planning an idealistic campaign against an Empire he came to see as an oppressor. The group was far more talk than action, but an informant sold it out to the academy commander. All its members were rounded up, except for Darklighter and Klivian, who had missed the single meeting the informant had attended.[3]
            Neither Klivian nor Darklighter were told what had happened, and initially assumed that some minor punishment had occurred or, as the group's absence grew longer, that they had been transferred elsewhere. As time wore on and the cadets were never seen again, Klivian slowly came to realize that the Empire had seized and possibly killed them for conspiracy against the government. Klivian's distaste for the Empire grew into hatred, and he began to seriously plan to defect to the Rebel Alliance that had begun to form and wage war against the Empire.[3] With Darklighter and Klivian each having survived the roundup, and neither having attended the only meeting with the informant, Darklighter began to suspect Klivian of having sold out the circle of conspirators, and their friendship dissolved as Darklighter grew to despise Klivian as an Imperial spy.[4]
            Klivian's class, graduating in 0 BBY, was known for exceptional performance.[11] At their graduation ceremony, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin gave a speech praising the Empire and hinting vaguely at coming deployment of the nearly-completed Death Star. Through his own sources, Klivian knew some details of the project. When he passed his former friend's dormitory, he overheard Darklighter and his friends speculating on Tarkin's words, and confirmed that a planet-destroying space station named the Death Star was in the works.[4] Subsequently Klivian was posted to the Class II Frigate Rand Ecliptic as the executive officer and second officer. Darklighter was the first officer, with Captain Heliesk commanding the ship.[4][3] The pair served both as bridge officers and as leaders of the ship's TIE complement.[4]
            Klivian arrived early aboard the Rand Ecliptic and met the gruff Heliesk. After Darklighter reported in and Heliesk dismissed the pair, Darklighter rounded on Klivian, accusing him of seeking Darklighter's position before storming off. The pair settled into the ship's patrol routine, and Klivian built up a cell of Rebel sympathizers aboard, planning to defect to the Rebel Alliance.[4] Klivian had an old friend, Lindy, who had informed Klivian that he had joined the Rebellion and was stationed on Bestine IV. As the Rand Ecliptic had a stop scheduled at Bestine, Klivian planned to jump ship there and join the Rebel Alliance through Lindy.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Derek_Klivian/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDerekKlivian</string></dict>
        <key>Kitster Chanchani Banai</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.648.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kitster Chanchani Banai was a Human slave boy on Tatooine, and the best friend of Anakin Skywalker. After not seeing his smuggler father, Rakir Banai, in many years, Kitster gave up hopes of being rescued from Tatooine and instead hoped to one day be a majordomo for a wealthy Mos Espan estate.
            Kitster Chanchani Banai was born the son of pirate Rakir Banai,[3] circa 41 BBY.[1] Rakir was wanted by the Hutts, who eventually tracked him down and captured his ship with his family on board. As a result, Kitster and his mother were sold into slavery, which brought them to the Tatooine city of Mos Espa.[3]
            A short time before the 32 BBY Boonta's Eve, the young Kitster, with Anakin Skywalker and their friends, narrowly avoided disaster upon hearing of children who had been captured and imprisoned by Sebulba. The Dug intended to sell the captives, including Princess Arawynne, to Gardulla the Elder. The children, disguised as Jawas, sneaked into Gardulla's estate and freed the Ghostling children.
            Kitster was the best friend of Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine, but he was also a slave—property of Gardulla, who was ever threatening to sell him to the glitterstim miners if he didn't "shape up."[4] During the podrace on Boonta Eve, Kitster was part of Anakin's pit crew.
            Before Anakin left to become a Jedi, he left Kitster some of his prize credits. With it, Kitster bought Par Ontham's Guide to Etiquette, a book that Kitster memorized to secure a job at the Three Moons, run by Rarta Dal. With that job, Kitster earned enough to buy his own freedom by the time he had grown up.[5]
            It was said that when Kitster grew up years later during the Clone Wars, he became a smuggler and disappeared on one of his runs. However, he was seen at Mos Espa again in 1.5 ABY. He did not know at the time that his best friend fell to the dark side and became the dreaded Darth Vader. In fact, he believed Anakin died during the Clone Wars.[6]
            When Kitster attempted to improve the lives of a group of slaves, he ended up offending their owner, Drik Bandrik. Angered, Bandrik framed Kitster by manipulating a tribe of violent Jawas into believing that Kitster had stolen a droid from them. Luckily for Kitster, a benevolent traveler agreed to help Kitster and kill the group of aggressive Jawas, all of whom were working for Wittin. As a reward, Kitster gave the traveler Anakin's podracing helmet. However, Kitster's problems were not yet over.[6]
            Bandrik had once again framed Kitster, this time planting evidence with Jabba the Hutt that implicated Kitster with attempting to lead a slave revolt at his palace a few years ago. Though a revolt did take place, and fail, Jabba was still enraged enough to send a Rodian henchman named Deeng to kill Kitster. The same traveler who had helped him before agreed to hunt down and kill Deeng.[6]
            Though the traveler succeeded in killing Deeng, Bandrik's persistence in framing Kitster did not end there. This time Kitster was being implicated in the murder of a moisture farmer. Kitster insisted that he was nowhere near the murder, and had the evidence to prove it. Kitster's alibi was that he was rotting in an Imperial jail cell during the time of the murder. He was arrested for "political agitation," as a result of his attempts to promote slave rights. Ultimately, the Galactic Empire released Kitster, because they believed him to be harmless. However, Sont Toipo, a local vigilante leader on Bandrik's payroll, was already rallying a lynch mob to kill Kitster. Kitster surmised that the mob consisted of six or eight local moisture farmers. He pleaded with the traveler to kill Sont Toipo, but to make an effort to spare the others, as they were merely farmers. Kitster hoped they would run off after Toipo was killed. The traveler agreed, and set out to successfully kill Toipo, while making an effort to spare the lives of the farmers. For the traveler's efforts, Kitster gave away another souvenir, a droid brain built by his old friend Anakin.[6]
            Eventually, Kitster learned that the "murdered" moisture farmer was in fact not murdered at all, but rather paid by Bandrik to leave town long enough for a lynch mob to be formed. In order to clear his name, Kitster asked the traveler to find the moisture farmer, a female Twi'lek named Krin Vel, and bring her back to Mos Espa. Despite being ambushed by thugs working for Bandrik, the traveler managed to find Krin, and escort her back. Krin claimed that she did not know she was being used in a plot against Kitster. She wished to be brought back, so that both Kitster and herself could see to it that Bandrik went to prison.[6]
            With the help of Krin, Kitster managed to assemble enough evidence that would clear him of Bandrik's fake charges. He considered sending the evidence to the police, but soon changed his mind when he surmised that the police and the Empire would have no reason to arrest him. He instead told the traveler to bring the evidence to a slicer friend, a Kitonak who went by the name Thermal Det. The traveler agreed to Kitster's final task, and succeeded in finding Thermal and giving him the evidence. Thermal saw to it that the information went straight to Jabba, and made it onto the HoloNet. Kitster thanked the traveler once again for helping him. Kitster concluded that Jabba would be angered with Bandrik for being manipulated. He believed that Bandrik would have to leave the planet if he ever hoped to survive.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kitster_Chanchani_Banai</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKitsterChanchaniBanai</string></dict>

            Charny was the Padawan of Master Handa; he became the lover of another of Handa's students, Githany, who was only a year younger than Charny. Handa was outraged at their affair, and harshly rebuked them, one of many factors leading to Githany betraying the Jedi and joining the Brotherhood of Darkness. After General Valenthyne Farfalla had warned him about Githany's defection to save his life, Charny refused to follow his former lover on that path.

They posed such a threat to men under his command, that Kieral had no choice but to seek help from the very enemy he was supposed to fight. In secrecy from his superiors, he arranged for meeting with Captain Biron of the Sith Empire, whose men were suffering from the same problem. Putting their issues aside, the officers focused on surviving at all, which meant taking out the Brotherhood. They began by setting an ambush and asking a Republic citizen to serve as bait, firing a signal flare and attacking the Brotherhood so that Imperials could round them in. Once the pirates' numbers were diminished, they planned a strike at the heart of the Brotherhood - an assault on the Chilling Death Spire. The main target was Brotherhood's spiritual leader Sav, known to survive several extreme situations in Hoth's cold weather. The assault force consisted of three teams: Sergeant Katcho's men from Republic side, Sergeant Ennlicher's squad from Imperial side and a gifted Republic citizen leading the assault.

During the Age of the Empire, he went by the alias of Ben Kenobi in order to hide from the regime that drove the Jedi to near extinction in the aftermath of the Clone Wars. A noble man known for his skills with the Force, Kenobi trained Anakin Skywalker as his Padawan, served as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic, and became a mentor to Luke Skywalker prior to his death in 0 BBY.
            Born on the planet Stewjon in 57 BBY, Kenobi was inducted into the Jedi Order at a young age and became the apprentice of Qui-Gon Jinn after completing his initial lessons under Grand Master Yoda. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Kenobi defeated the Sith Lord Darth Maul and was awarded the status of Jedi Knight. Kenobi also began training Anakin Skywalker, having promised his dying master that the boy would become a Jedi, but often had to rein in his adventure-seeking apprentice. Over the years Kenobi became concerned that Skywalker's powers made him arrogant, but also regarded him as a good friend and a brother, and ultimately believed that Skywalker was in fact the Chosen One destined to restore balance to the Force by destroying the Sith. When the Clone Wars began in 22 BBY, the Jedi rallied to defend the Galactic Republic against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and Kenobi became a general in the newly-formed Republic military. Kenobi and Skywalker often served alongside each other, leading their respective clone trooper divisions, the 212th Attack Battalion and the 501st Legion, against the Separatist Droid Army. However, in 19 BBY Skywalker fell to the dark side of the Force and embraced his new identity as the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Kenobi, who was betrayed by his soldiers as a result of Order 66, confronted his fallen apprentice on Mustafar. The ensuing lightsaber duel between the former friends concluded when Vader was maimed at the hands of his one-time master, who withdrew into exile with Skywalker's newborn son.
            For two decades Kenobi lived as a hermit on the planet Tatooine, located in the Outer Rim Territories, hiding from the Galactic Empire that replaced the Republic. When Princess Leia Organa beseeched him to join their Rebel cause in 0 BBY, Kenobi was prepared to join the Alliance to Restore the Republic and also decided that the time had come for Luke Skywalker to become a Jedi like his father before him. However, their journey to Alderaan became a rescue operation upon discovering that the princess had been taken as a prisoner to the Death Star. While attempting to help his allies escape from the battle station, Kenobi encountered Vader, now rebuilt as a cyborg and forced to rely on an armored suit with life support technology in order to survive. Though he initially defended himself, Kenobi ultimately sacrificed himself, allowing Vader to strike him down as the Rebels fled on the Millennium Falcon. Yet death was not the end of Obi-Wan Kenobi, however. Having learned to preserve his identity in the Force, Kenobi became a Force spirit, and was therefore able to continue guiding Luke on the path to Jedi Knighthood.
            A human male from Stewjon,[5] Obi-Wan Kenobi was born 57 years before the Battle of Yavin.[2] A Force-sensitive individual, he was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to be trained as a Jedi[5] at the age of three,[12] an unusually late age since younglings were typically identified within six months of their birth.[13] At some point before he was selected as a Padawan, Kenobi attended a class centered around meditation.[14] When Kenobi was a youngling, he underwent training with Grand Master Yoda before being assigned as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn's Padawan learner.[5] who would teach him there was "a strength and nobility in restraint".[15] Sometime after being assigned to Jinn, Kenobi and his master engaged in a lightsaber training session, where Jinn congratulated his apprentice for his skills.[14] At some point during his time as a Jedi Padawan, Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn, visited a fortress on the planet Lah'mu.[12]
            Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon spent a year on the planet Mandalore protecting Duchess Satine Kryze from insurgents who were threatening her world. Bounty hunters were sent after them, forcing them to always be on the run and live hand to mouth, never knowing what the next day would bring them. During that time, they had an incident with a swarm of venom-mites on Draboon, where Kenobi carried Kryze to safety, only to fall and drop the Duchess, who then acquired a scar. Obi-Wan fell in love with Satine during his stay on Mandalore, but despite his feelings toward her, he continued with his training and was reassigned. Kenobi regretted leaving her, but ultimately followed the Jedi Code he had sworn to live by.[16]
            The Jedi Order sent Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon to the planet Bri'n to resolve a conflict. On Bri'n, the leader of the Metal Clan attempted to capture priestess Th'er so that either her word or her blood could be used to destroy her trees. Surrounded by forces of the Metal Clan, Jinn chose to escape with Th'er in an Eta-class shuttle and return to Coruscant.[17]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascObiWanKenobi</string></dict>

        <key>Kell Tainer</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.656.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kell Tainer was a Human male pilot, commando and member of Wraith Squadron starting from its inception in 7 ABY. A naturalized citizen of Sluis Van, he was a skilled demolitions expert, hand-to-hand combatant, and starfighter mechanic. Tainer's last name was originally Doran, but his family changed his name after Kell's father, Kissek Doran, earned a label of cowardice while serving as a starfighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. Kell served in the commandos for some time before transferring to Starfighter Command, participating in the Second Battle of Borleias with distinction.
            Seeking to clear his family name, Tainer transferred into starfighters, but was not as successful as he was in the commandos. Tainer was recruited into Wraith Squadron, though much to his dismay he encountered Wes Janson, the man who had killed his father. Kell, however, performed admirably in the Wraiths as an X-wing pilot, a mechanic, and as a demolitions expert. Service in the Wraiths improved Tainer's emotional stability, and he was able to reconcile with Janson and realize that he was unsuited for command. He served in the missions to defeat Apwar Trigit and later Warlord Zsinj, and became romantically involved with fellow Wraith Tyria Sarkin, whom he later married. The couple had two children, a son named Doran and a daughter named Jesmin, both of whom were Force-sensitive. Tainer remained in the Wraiths after they transferred to Intelligence and participated in a mission on Ryvester to eliminate Imperial admiral Kosh Teradoc, creating a bomb that Teradoc was conned into taking into his private vaults and research labs, where it exploded. Tainer was still active as of the Yuuzhan Vong War, assisting in the defense of Borleias and with the infiltration of occupied Coruscant. Following the end of that conflict, he retired from the military. Years later, Tainer served as an explosives technician on Kessel in order to prematurely detonate alien explosives packages buried in tunnels beneath the surfaces.
            Kell Tainer was born on Alderaan during the reign of the Galactic Empire, though his family's surname was originally Doran. Tainer's father, a man named Kissek Doran, was part of the Rebel Alliance and served in the Tierfon Yellow Aces as a starfighter pilot. While on a mission, Doran suddenly turned tail, risking the position of the other Rebel starfighters by his cowardice. A fellow squad member, Wes Janson, was forced to shoot down Doran, killing him in order to preserve the mission. Tainer's family and Kell Tainer himself were devastated emotionally, not only by Kissek Doran's death, but also by the fact that he'd died as a coward.[1]
            In his adulthood, Tainer joined the New Republic that had superseded the Rebel Alliance. He served as a fighter-craft mechanic on the world of Sluis Van and eventually joined the commandos, where he was trained in the use of demolitions. While serving with the Katarn Commandos, he developed an aptitude for unarmed combat and received additional training in that form of warfare.[1]
            Despite his success, Tainer desired to salvage his family's name by flying as a successful New Republic starfighter pilot. He started work in starfighter simulators, but though he was largely a talented pilot, two incidents haunted him. In the first, Tainer crashed a Z-95 Headhunter and in the second, his landing of an X-wing fighter was hard enough to damage the craft. In both cases, Tainer claimed unresponsive controls to be the source of the accidents, a claim which was later inferred to indicate an unwillingness to accept responsibility for his failures. As such, he was close to washing out of eligibility as a starfighter pilot.[1]
            Prior to his joining Wraith Squadron, Kell served with distinction in Judder Page's Katarn Commandos during the Second Battle of Borleias. He planted explosive charges under fire while on Borleias and was subsequently recognized for his efforts.[1]
            In 7 ABY, Tainer saw one last chance to redeem his father's name by joining a starfighter squadron. He volunteered for and was selected as one of the pilot-candidates for a new unit put together by reputed ace Commander Wedge Antilles. Tainer reported for a preliminary meeting with Antilles, only to find that Antilles' executive officer was none other than Wes Janson, the man who had slain Tainer's father. As soon as Janson's identity was confirmed, Tainer immediately requested withdrawal of his application to join the squadron. Antilles, however, insisted on knowing the reason for that action, and Tainer was compelled to tell him the truth.[1]
            After Antilles held a private conversation with Janson, Tainer was brought back in to face the two officers. Tainer was asked by Antilles to stay in the unit because of the value of his skills, though the former commando was seething merely at being in the presence of Janson. Antilles also warned Tainer that this was his last chance as a pilot—and his last chance to clear his family name of the stain of cowardice. That last statement was enough to move Tainer to open anger, but Antilles was nonplussed and asked for Tainer's decision. Tainer opted to stay in the new unit and transferred to Folor Base to begin the training and evaluation process.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kell_Tainer</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKellTainer</string></dict>
        <key>Kel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.657.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kel was a human male, the older brother of Eila. In 34 ABY, he and his sister escaped their homeworld of Tehar after First Order forces led by Kylo Ren massacred their village. Kel and Eila fled to the Colossus platform on the planet Castilon. Despite being pursued by First Order forces led by Commander Pyre, the two siblings managed to find refuge with the help of Resistance pilot Kazuda Xiono and the Chelidae.
            During the New Republic era, Kel and his sister Eila were forced to flee their homeworld of Tehar as stowaways after the army of the First Order, led by Kylo Ren, wiped out their villages' inhabitants including their parents. The siblings were the only survivors. When the First Order discovered there were survivors, they sought to hunt down and kill Kel and Eila, posting a 20,000 credit bounty on their heads.[1]
            Eventually, the siblings came to the Colossus platform on Castilon, where Kel stole some food for them from an Ugnaught vendor, and as a result they were forced to flee the marketplace, bowling over Kazuda Xiono, Neeku Vozo and BB-8 on their way out. Xiono, secretly a Resistance spy, had heard of the bounty on the siblings' heads and, not knowing who placed it, was trying to find the children as he needed the money. Kel angrily refused Xiono's help, and he and his sister ran off. He lost a wooden charm attached to his wristband in the process, which Xiono picked up and later gave to Captain Imanuel Doza.[1]
            While they were hiding in the service ducts, Kel and Eila were tracked down by the Chelidae who worked as the platform's engineers, who had been asked to do so by Vozo. When he met Xiono again in the engineering room, Kel explained that, contrary to the bounty report, he and his sister were runaways, not missing, because they didn't have a home to go back to. When Xiono realized they were running from the First Order, he promised to help them get away safely. Kel was accompanied by Xiono, Vozo and BB-8 when they went back to the marketplace to pick up some herbs to help with Eila's broken leg.[1]
            However, some First Order troops led by Commander Pyre had come to search for them, and they were seen, resulting in a chase back to engineering. There, Xiono came up with a plan to help the siblings fake their deaths. Kel and Eila, cornered by Pyre and his troopers, made it look like they jumped into the ocean rather than allow themselves to be captured, with two Chelidae jumping in their place, and then slowing down their vital signs. Afterwards, the two siblings stayed with the Chelidae, who offered them a safe place to live for the time being.[1]
            When Eila began having recurring dreams of a danger coming to the Colossus, Kel was aware from experience that the dreams were of the future. And when he and Eila caught Vozo's loose pet Bibo after he got loose, the siblings were aware that the pet was connected to the danger. They informed Vozo and Tamara Ryvora of the danger when they came down to engineering to retrieve the animal, confirming the statement when the roar of Bibo's mother, a full-grown rokkna, was heard.[3]
            After the First Order occupied the Colossus, Kel and his sister were fishing for snarlfish on the underside of the platform when their laughter was overheard by a patrolling stormtrooper, CS-515. Kel claimed that the two children had lost their identification, so CS-515 attempted to take them away, grabbing Eila by the wrist. Kel and Eila fought him, eventually knocking him unconscious. Aware that this could lead to trouble, they decided to go to Xiono for help. Although it was dangerous for them to be on the platform's upper levels, they went to Jarek Yeager's Repair Station, where Xiono and Jarek Yeager were eating lunch with Vozo and Ryvora. When Kel and Eila asked for help, Xiono called for Vozo and BB-8 to come along. Xiono tried to talk Ryvora out of coming because she hadn't listened to his warnings about the First Order, but she insisted.[4]
            Kel and Eila led the Team Fireball members to where they had stashed the unconscious trooper in a closet, which prompted panic, as Xiono was concerned he could wake up and kill them all, while Ryvora thought they should turn themselves in. When CS-515 began to come to, Vozo knocked him out again with a wrench. Xiono made it clear they had to move CS-515 before other First Order personnel discovered him, and the group hauled him off to engineering. Kel and Eila stayed downstairs while Xiono hit upon the idea of impersonating the trooper both so that his absence wouldn't be missed and to ascertain if the trooper had reported the children's presence. While Xiono was upstairs, Ryvora panicked about Xiono's actions, and Kel and Eila called her out for trusting the First Order's word more than that of her friends, who were telling her about the Order's untrustworthiness. Ryvora was shocked when the siblings told her about why they had fled Tehar. When CS-515 woke up, groggy, Kel and Eila initially hid with Ryvora while Vozo dealt with the trooper. When he panicked upon seeing a Chelidae, Eila managed to calm him down, before Vozo shocked him unconscious again.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kel_(boy)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKel</string></dict>
        <key>Sixtus Quin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.658.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sixtus Quin was an Imperial Special Intelligence operative who later defected to the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He eventually left the Rebel Alliance and went into business with Elscol Loro, forming an anti-Imperial mercenary organization.
            Quin and his elite squad left the Empire after being betrayed by Captain Marl Semtin. Sixtus killed Semtin at Eidolon Base on Tatooine, and his squad joined forces with former Rogue Squadron pilot Elscol Loro to form an anti-Imperial mercenary group.
            Sixtus and Elscol would later be recruited by the members of Rogue Squadron in 7 ABY after the Rogues left the New Republic to wage the Bacta War against Ysanne Isard. Sixtus, Elscol, Mirax Terrik, Iella Wessiri, and Corran Horn were inserted into Thyferra to create a native Vratix insurgency and defeat Isard's forces on the planet. Despite a skirmish at the spaceport and attacks on the Vratix by Isard's troops, Sixtus was able to create a formidable resistance force. Sixtus helped capture and humiliate Erisi Dlarit's father. As the Rogues and their allies engaged Isard's flagship Lusankya over Thyferra, Sixtus and the insurgents attacked Isard's headquarters, eventually capturing Fliry Vorru, although Isard escaped in a shuttle. Ultimately, the Bacta War was a success and Isard was presumed killed.
            Michael A. Stackpole did not originally intend Sixtus to be an african; he was made that way by John Nadeau, the illustrator of Star Wars: X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Battleground: Tatooine.[1]
            Although his military rank is never given, according to his rank badge, Sixtus could have been either a Lieutenant or a Captain during his time in the Imperial forces.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sixtus_Quin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSixtusQuin</string></dict>

        <key>Alton Kastle</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.662.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alton Kastle was a human male journalist who worked as a broadcaster on HoloNet News on the planet Lothal. As a broadcast journalist, he helped spread propaganda for the Galactic Empire, including propaganda about Wookiees and local unemployment rates. The Leonis family sometimes watched news broadcasts by Alton Kastle. While Leo Leonis believed the Imperial line, both Zare Leonis and Tepha Leonis came to learn that Kastle was a stooge who often delivered news that was either carefully manicured truth or entirely fictitious.
            Alton Kastle was an Imperial broadcaster who was based on the planet Lothal during the Age of the Empire. In 6 BBY, he reported on the Westhills massacre. Kastle claimed that insurgents had destroyed mining equipment and attacked Imperial surveyors in the Westhills, forcing the Empire to send in troops to restore order. In truth, Imperial forces under Lieutenant Piers Roddance had opened fire on a sit-in demonstration by disaffected farmers who had lost their lands to an Imperial mining project. Zare Leonis and his friend Beck Ollet knew the truth but did not tell his parents, who accepted Kastle's account.[3]
            Between 5 BBY and 4 BBY, Kastle served as a newscaster for several Imperial HoloNet News reports including Lothal's new Imperial Registration Program[4], the suppression of a Wookiee revolt on Kashyyyk[5], reduced unemployment rates[6], the Empire's new affordable housing program[7], and a ban on unauthorized mining.[8] While many Imperial citizens on Lothal like Leo Leonis accepted Kastle's reports, others like Leo's wife Tepha Leonis and son Zare regarded his reports as carefully manicured truths or fabricated propaganda designed to portray the Empire in a positive light.[9]
            After the Spectres rebels Ezra Bridger and Garazeb Orrelios attacked an Imperial Troop Transport and rescued Imperial prisoners including Morad Sumar, Marida Sumar and their Aqualish servant, Kastle issued a spin report claiming that the rebels had attacked innocent workers. Kastle's HoloNet transmission was then hacked by a broadcast from the rogue Senator Gall Trayvis claiming that the Jedi Master Luminara Unduli was being imprisoned on Stygeon Prime.[10] On the fourteenth anniversary of Empire Day, Kastle delivered a news report announcing that the holiday was commemorating Emperor Palpatine's creation of the the Empire. His broadcast was hacked by a transmission by Trayvis calling on Lothalians to boycott the annual Empire Day celebrations.[11]
            Later, Kastle delivered another news broadcast deriding the Lothal City Capitol Building in Lothal's Capital City as a bygone relic. This was quickly shadowed by a coded transmission from Trayvis instructing the Spectres to meet him at the Old Republic Senate Hall. Unknown to the Specters, Trayvis was an undercover agent provocateur working with the Empire to root out and destroy rebel operatives. The rebels narrowly escaped a trap set by the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus and the Minister Maketh Tua, who were acting under orders from Governor Arihnda Pryce.[12]
            After the Spectres escaped the Imperial trap, Kastle hosted an interview with Trayvis, who publicly rededicated himself to serving the Empire. Trayvis also denounced the Spectres as violent extremists who had appropriated his message and placed a bounty on them. In response, the Spectres devised a plan to hijack the Imperial Communications Center near Jalath to give their side of the story.[1] During the Siege of Lothal, Kastle gave a news report claiming that the Spectres had assassinated Tua. In reality, the Spectres had been trying to help Tua escape and Kallus had bombed her shuttle and framed the rebels.[13]
            In 2 BBY, Alton Kastle delivered a news broadcast denouncing the former senator Mon Mothma for her allegedly treasonous speech condemning the Emperor Palpatine's complicity in the Ghorman Massacre. This broadcast was picked up by the Spectres, whose ship Ghost was in deep space. Shortly later, the Spectres, who were now part of Phoenix Cell, helped escort the rogue senator through the Archeon Nebula to the planet Dantooine.[14]
            Following the death of Kanan Jarrus in 1 BBY, Alton Kastle issued a propaganda broadcast claiming that the rebellion on Lothal was lost with the death of their leadership. He then announced that Governor Pryce had organized a parade to commemorate the Imperial leadership's efforts to defeat the "extremists" and that all citizens were required to attend the parade.[15]
            A few months after the Battle of Yavin, Kastle delivered a broadcast reporting on the apparent treason of Imperial Captain Iden Versio, who made disparaging remarks regarding the Death Star and the Galactic Empire as a whole. In reality, Versio's comments were part of a ruse to embed herself into the ranks of a Partisan cell calling themselves the Dreamers.[16]
            Alton Kastle was a human male broadcaster who lived during the Age of the Empire. He was known for his impeccable dress[17] and familiar, comforting voice.[3] While Kastle was popular with many pro-Imperial citizens, dissenters like Zare Leonis regarded him as an Imperial stooge who distorted the truth and made up lies.[9] Kastle was a staunch Imperial loyalist and regularly denounced the rebels as criminals[10] and traitors.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alton_Kastle</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAltonKastle</string></dict>
        <key>Siward Cass</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.663.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Siward Cass was a Human male military officer who served the Galactic Empire aboard the first Death Star during the Galactic Civil War. By 0 BBY, he was a war veteran and had acted as an aide to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin for many years.
            A Human male, Siward Cass was born in the Patriim system,[1][2] within the Seswenna sector of the Outer Rim region of the galaxy.[5] At some point during his life, he joined the ground forces of Palpatine's Galactic Empire. For many years, he served as an aide to Wilhuff Tarkin, Grand Moff of the Oversector Outer.
            By the time of the Galactic Civil War, a major galactic conflict fought between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, he was considered a veteran. Cass acted as the chief communications officer aboard the first Death Star battlestation. He was entrusted with extremely sensitive information and communications between Tarkin and the Imperial government. Because of this, he was part of the Death Star command, and had a seat at its conference table. Cass' duties ranged from handling routine communications to delivering priority news to the Grand Moff.[1]
            In 0 BBY, the Imperials managed to capture Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, who had strong ties with the Rebel Alliance, and Tarkin tried to make her confess the location of the Rebels' headquarters. Organa ended up giving the name of Dantooine, after which that planet was checked for Rebel presence. Subsequently, Cass was committed with the delicate task of reporting to Tarkin that it no longer held any active base. Although he found the situation uncomfortable,[6] Cass did his duty with no signs of nervousness. Having made his report, he immediately exited the room.[4] Cass perished as the Death Star was destroyed during the Battle of Yavin.[3]
            Around the Battle of Yavin, Siward Cass was a pale-skinned, older man who sported short gray hair.[4] Within the Imperial military, he was considered a model adjutant. However, despite his reputation for being self-possessed and discreet,[1] Cass still was wary of Tarkin's wrath, and he disliked being the one bearing bad news to the Moff.[6]
            Siward Cass made his first appearance in the 1977 Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, in which he was portrayed by English actor Patrick Jordan.[source?] Albeit unnamed in the movie itself,[4] he was referred to as "Cass" in its novelization.[6]
            Although Cass was sometimes identified as a general by fan-created sources[7], he was initially only referred to in canon as "Imperial Officer Cass" or "Officer Cass," and his exact rank long remained unknown. Unlike most characters whose names are known in the script, Officer Cass did not have an entry in the StarWars.com official Databank.
            In 2013, Cass was eventually given the first name "Siward" and the rank of "Chief" in both the Death Star Owner's Technical Manual[8] and the article The Death Star Coup, written by Jason Fry for the Special Edition 2014 of the Star Wars Insider magazine.[1] According to Chris Trevas, one of the co-authors of the Technical Manual, Cass was given that rank because his insignia plaque was the same one as Moradmin Bast's,[9] who was first identified as "Chief Bast" in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game Premiere Limited expansion set.[10] Fry chose the character's first name as a nod to William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, which featured the character of Siward, Earl of Northumberland, general of the English forces.[11]
            The 2008 novel Death Star featured an unidentified colonel serving as Tarkin's aide, although it is not clear whether he was intended to be Cass or not.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Siward_Cass/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSiwardCass</string></dict>

            A Force-sensitive Human, Qui-Ko was trained in the ways of the Force by the Je'daii Order on the planet Tython, one of nine planets in the Tython system which made up the Settled Worlds. Ascending to the rank of Je'daii Master, Qui-Ko wrote many texts based on his study of the Ashla and his own visions of the future. Following the Force Wars and the death of the Je'daii Order, Qui-Ko's teachings and manuscripts were preserved by members of the fledgling Jedi Order, eventually making their way into the Archives of the Coruscant Jedi Temple. Safely housed in the Temple, these text were analyzed by generations of Jedi Knights reflecting on the origins of the Order, and the earliest teachings of the Force.[1]
            Qui-Ko was first mentioned in The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force, a 2010 reference book by Daniel Wallace.

        <key>Jorj Car'das</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.670.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jorj Car'das was a Human male from Corellia who lived during the time of the Galactic Republic, the Galactic Empire, and the New Republic. Early in his life, Car'das joined the crew of the smuggling ship Bargain Hunter, working mainly as a bootlegger for the Hutts. In 27 BBY, Car'das, Dubrak Qennto, and Maris Ferasi became the captives of Commander Thrawn of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force. Thrawn wished to learn the language of the Republic from the smugglers; they stayed in his base on Crustai for several weeks, teaching him Basic and learning the Chiss language, Cheunh. Car'das assisted Thrawn in defeating the alien Vagaari, before being allowed to return to the Republic.
            Car'das eventually parted ways with his companions after being given an offer by Sith agent Kinman Doriana to start a smuggling organization that would double as an intelligence operation for Darth Sidious. Car'das's organization flourished, and he built up a huge repository of information. However, he was kidnapped by a Dark Jedi after the Clone Wars, and although he was rescued by Jedi Master Yoda, Car'das left the encounter a changed man. He became extremely ruthless during the time of the Empire, though his health began to deteriorate; Yoda healed him with the Force initially, though the second time Car'das visited Yoda's planet of residence, Dagobah, the Jedi Master refused to heal him, sending him to the Aing-Tii monks instead. Car'das ultimately spent over a dozen years studying with the Aing-Tii, learning of their views on the Force. He later settled down on the planet Exocron, though in 19 ABY he was approached by smuggler Talon Karrde, who was seeking an intact copy of the Caamas Document in the hopes of ending the crisis. Car'das did not possess a copy, but he was privy to top secret information about Moff Vilim Disra's plot to impersonate Thrawn, which Karrde used to help end the crisis.
            Born and raised on Corellia during the waning days of the Galactic Republic, Jorj Car'das lived an unremarkable early life. He was well educated, though he rarely traveled and had a limited knowledge of other parts of the galaxy and their native species. By 27 BBY, just a few years after leaving school, Car'das was a navigator aboard the Bargain Hunter, a smuggling ship rented by Captain Dubrak Qennto. The Bargain Hunter had just three crew members—Car'das, Qennto, and Maris Ferasi—though they made a reasonably lucrative trade smuggling firegems and other illicit materials to Hutt gangsters in the Outer Rim Territories.[1]
            In 27 BBY, the Bargain Hunter was on a smuggling run transporting firegems hidden within stolen furs to Drixo the Hutt. Drixo's rival, Progga, had learned of the operation and launched an attack on the Bargain Hunter on the fringes of the Outer Rim. As navigator, Car'das was forced to make an emergency hyperspace jump, and the ship ended up deep in the Unknown Regions. Qennto was furious at the Corellian for jumping blind, but Ferasi defended Car'das, knowing that he had had no choice. However, they were followed by Progga, who believed that Qennto had a secret treasure hold. Just as the Hutt prepared to shoot them, an unknown group of alien ships—three fighter-size craft and a larger cruiser—arrived, deploying a group of Conner nets that disabled the two ships. The Bargain Hunter was left floating adrift in space for several minutes. When Progga's ship fired on the mysterious vessels, they attacked, destroying the Hutt's ship with ease and instilling some trepidation in Car'das and his companions.[1]
            Qennto and Ferasi departed the bridge to check the extent of the damage caused by the Conner nets, leaving Car'das alone on the bridge, ready to reply to any communications sent by the attackers. They made no attempt to communicate, however, and Qennto and Ferasi were able to restore the majority of the freighter's systems while the attackers searched Progga's vessel. Eventually, one of the smaller alien ships beckoned for the Bargain Hunter to follow them towards the largest ship, where they docked. Upon exiting their ship, they were escorted by a pair of blue-skinned Humanoids to a being named Mitth'raw'nuruodo, who told them to call him by his core name—Thrawn. After finding a language in which both parties were proficient—Sy Bisti, a local trade language—Thrawn identified himself as the leader of a frontier picket force of the Chiss Ascendancy's Expansionary Fleet. He expressed a particular interest in Car'das, inquiring as to who they were and what their purpose was. Car'das answered mostly truthfully, omitting any mention of the firegems, though Thrawn was suspicious that they were scouts for an invasion attempt and requested to examine their cargo. Qennto, Ferasi, and Car'das were taken to their temporary living quarters while Thrawn's soldiers searched the Bargain Hunter.[1]
            After being held in their quarters for a time, the smugglers were questioned by Thrawn, who asked about the invasion force he believed would follow them. He asked that Car'das alone answer his questions, much to Qennto's annoyance, as he was the captain. Car'das felt that it would not be wise to lie to the Chiss commander, and so he answered him truthfully, telling him about the illegal firegems they were smuggling. In addition, he revealed that they were Corellian traders, although Thrawn did not know of Corellia. Car'das also managed to convince Thrawn that there was no invasion fleet and that the Republic was unaware of the Chiss. Qennto was extremely irritated by Car'das's honesty, not understanding why the smuggler had revealed so much. Car'das protested that Thrawn seemed to know the details already and that he had an aura of one who should not be lied to.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jorj_Car%27das</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJorjCar'das</string></dict>

        <key>Davik Kang</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.673.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Davik Kang was a male Human crime-lord and long-time member of the Exchange, an interstellar criminal syndicate that was active during the era of the Jedi Civil War. By the time of the war's height, he was the head of Exchange operations on the Outer Rim world of Taris, where he kept his estate.
            It was implied by Zelka Forn's assistant that Kang originally grew up in the Lower City and lived in poverty along with the non-Humans, unlike most Humans of Taris. He had a large majority of non-Human bounty hunters, most notably Rodians. At some point he became the leader of the Exchange on Taris. After he came to power he became owner of the Ebon Hawk.
            Kang employed dozens of mercenaries and enforcers to keep Taris under his unofficial control, most notably the former Mandalorian Canderous Ordo and the bounty hunter Calo Nord. Kang collected the stuffed heads of ferocious creatures hunted and killed by Nord, but his most prized possession was his smuggling vessel, the Ebon Hawk. Kang resented the Sith presence on Taris because their planet-wide blockade had halted his inter-galactic operations, but he knew well enough to avoid bothering them.
            After rescuing Bastila Shan from the Black Vulkars, the former Dark Lord of the Sith, Revan (whose identity was secret) was approached by Ordo, who offered Revan the chance to leave Taris, provided he could retrieve the necessary planetary launch codes from a nearby Sith military base. Revan agreed to steal the codes in return for Ordo convincing Kang to hire Revan as another mercenary. The situation was beneficial for both Revan and Ordo, and the two worked together to steal the Ebon Hawk. Revan and his companions made their escape while his former apprentice, Darth Malak, began bombarding the city into dust from orbit.
            Outraged at the treachery of both Canderous Ordo and Revan, Kang and Calo Nord attempted to stop Revan from stealing his ship; however, they underestimated the amnesiac Dark Lord and Kang was killed. Nord, realizing he was outgunned, pulled out a thermal detonator and hoped he would take Revan and his friends with him. When Kang's estate was again directly hit by Malak's laser blasts, the hangar nearly collapsed, trapping Nord under the wreckage. He escaped to attack Revan again later, but Davik's estate along with the rest of Taris was destroyed by the orbital bombardment.
            Kang's powerful battle suit was a legend in itself. Rumor had it that it was so incredible, being light and flexible yet extremely durable, that Kang decided to kill the ingenious technician who constructed it, assuring that no one had a suit of a similar design. He also possessed a prototype visor that gave the wearer improved facility with blasters. The crime lord was eventually stripped of these items by Revan before the Ebon Hawk escaped from the collapsing city-planet.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Davik_Kang</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDavikKang</string></dict>
        <key>Caleb</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.674.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Caleb was a Human male healer who resided on the abandoned world of Ambria. He was killed by Darth Zannah in 990 BBY.
            Caleb lived during the last days of the New Sith Wars, but refused to be a party to the wars, and sought the planet Ambria as a refuge. He turned away both Jedi and Sith, seeing himself as a neutral party and a healer to the common people.[2]
            His rigid policy of neutrality was challenged when the exiled Sith Lord Darth Bane came to his home in 1000 BBY, seeking a cure for the synox with which his former lover Githany had poisoned him. Caleb refused to treat him at first, going so far as to thrust his hand into a cauldron of boiling liquid to demonstrate his impartiality to pain. This implied that he would be immune to any torture that the Sith Lord had planned; they would have no power over him since he accepted his fate. The impossibility of scaring the healer frustrated Bane, however, Bane sensed the nearby presence of Caleb's daughter. After Bane threatened to end her life, Caleb agreed to cure him. Sensing that Caleb would be a useful contact in the future, Bane allowed him to live.[2]
            In 990 BBY, when Darth Zannah came looking for Caleb, he refused to heal Darth Bane, who had been mortally injured. Darovit made a deal with Caleb to heal Bane, as long as Zannah turned herself and Bane in to the Jedi and deactivated their ship, the Loranda. At last Zannah complied and after Caleb healed Bane and removed the orbalisks, he made sure Zannah sent out a message to the Jedi Order that there was a Sith Lord on Ambria, waiting to be arrested. Zannah, however, wished to save Bane and preserve the Order of the Sith Lords, therefore she killed Caleb and drove Darovit insane with her sorcery. Later, she hid Bane and herself in an underground hiding spot of Caleb's, cloaking their presences in the Force. The Jedi arrived and found Caleb's body chopped up outside of his shack. As they neared, Darovit attacked them and was killed almost instantly. The Jedi took all the pieces of Caleb's corpse back to Coruscant to give him a proper funeral.[1]
            Once returned to the Jedi Temple, the Jedi created a memorial to those Jedi who were responsible for the destruction of the Sith. All five of the Jedi's lightsaber hilts were set into a large white stone block in the gardens around the base of the Tower of First Knowledge. In honor to his sacrifice for the Republic, Caleb's name was inscribed in the block. In 980 BBY, Caleb's daughter, who had become Princess Serra of Doan, saw the name while visiting the Temple to negotiate on behalf of her planet. Upon learning of her father's death, she ordered her bodyguard, Lucia to contact the Huntress to capture Bane, who she believed had killed her father.[4]
            Caleb's healing abilities stemmed from the Force but it was not like that of the Jedi or Sith; his power came directly from the world around him, the natural power of the mountains and forests. Using the knowledge found in the Jedi Archives by Zannah, he was successfully able to remove Bane's orbalisk armor and save his life.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Caleb</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCaleb</string></dict>

        <key>Thane Kyrell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.676.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Thane Kyrell, later designated AV-547 in the Imperial Navy, was a human male from the mountainous and remote planet of Jelucan, an Outer Rim Territory that was annexed by the Empire eleven years before the Battle of Yavin. He pursued his childhood dream of becoming a pilot with his best friend Ciena Ree, attending and graduating from the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant. After witnessing the destruction of Alderaan and the enslavement of the Bodach'i species on Kerev Doi, Thane soon joined the Rebel Alliance to end the tyranny and oppression of the Empire.
            After spending some time as the co-pilot and navigator of the Wookiee Lohgarra, Thane joined Corona Squadron, an X-wing starfighter squadron. He would fight in several key battles of the Galactic Civil War including the Battle of Hoth, the Battle of Endor, and the Battle of Jakku. Despite fighting in opposite sides, Thane and Ciena maintained a deep connection with each other that eventually blossomed into romance.
            Following the Battle of Endor, Kyrell supported the New Republic, the successor government to the Rebel Alliance. He and Ciena crossed paths again during the Battle of Jakku when he rescued her from a stricken Imperial Star Destroyer.
            Thane Kyrell was an aristocrat from the planet Jelucan in the Outer Rim Territories. He was the son of Oris and Ganaire Kyrell and had an older brother named Dalven Kyrell. Thane and his family were Second-wavers, a group of affluent migrants that had recently settled on the Outer Rim world of Jelucan. The Second-wavers were preceded by the First Wavers, an earlier group of human settlers who had settled in the valleys of Jelucan over five hundred years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. Most Second-wavers, including the Kyrell family, looked down on the First Wavers as backward peasants. During his childhood, Thane was regularly bullied and intimidated by his older brother, Dalven, whom his parents favored at his expense. Thane also had a strained relationship with his father, who verbally belittled him and physically assaulted him on several occasions.[1]
            At the age of eight, Thane once outsmarted Dalven by identifying the humming engine of a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle while traveling to a ceremony to celebrate the establishment of Imperial rule on Jelucan. After listening to Grand Moff Tarkin's speech, Thane's parents left his older brother Dalven to babysit him while they attended a private function. When Dalven abandoned him to chat with some friends, Thane went behind Tarkin's stage to inspect the Grand Moff's Lambda-class shuttle. There, he came to the rescue of a First Waver girl named Ciena Ree, who was being harassed by a group of Second-waver boys.[1]
            Despite being outnumbered and outmatched, Thane sprang to Ciena's defense and fought the bullies. Their fight was interrupted by Grand Moff Tarkin and his entourage, which included several Imperial officers and stormtroopers. While the other boys ran away, Thane and Ciena stayed behind to face Tarkin. After Ciena told Tarkin that Thane had saved her from being beaten up by the older boys, a bemused Tarkin counselled Thane not to fight against superior forces. When Thane replied that he had been counting on Tarkin as his superior force, the Grand Moff praised the boy for his strategic thinking.[1]
            Realizing that the two children were curious about the wider galaxy, the Grand Moff quizzed Thane and Ciena about his starship, which they correctly identified as a Lambda-class shuttle. Impressed, Tarkin allowed them to tour his ship and play in the instruments as a cockpit. Having established a rapport with the children, he took the opportunity to encourage them to serve Emperor Sheev Palpatine by joining the Imperial Military when they came of age. In order to reach that goal, they had to gain entrance to one of the Empire's Imperial Academies. Following their meeting with Tarkin, the two children resolved to study hard so that they could become pilots. When Ciena revealed she did not have a flight simulator of her own, Thane kindly allowed her to share his.[1]
            For the rest of their childhood, Thane and Ciena bonded over their love of flying and pushed each other to excel. Over the next five years, Ciena regularly visited the Kyrell family's household where she practiced on Thane's flight simulator. Thane was also tutored in mathematics and the sciences by the family's tutor droid CZ-1. While his parents tolerated Ciena, his brother Dalven mocked her for her poverty and "old-fashioned ways." On one occasion, Thane had struck Dalven in the cheek before their parents pulled them apart. Though his brother had forbidden him the use of his V-171 airspeeder, Thane and Ciena flaunted this rule and took rides in the airspeeder.[1]
            At the age of thirteen, Thane once managed to sneak out of a mathematics test by bribing CZ-1 with the offer of a lubrication bath, which the droid heartily accepted. After taking a flying fox to his family's hangar, he encountered Ciena, who had arrived in her family's ridgecrawler. After bantering, the two friends borrowed Dalven's airspeeder for a joy ride and flew to their secret hideout, a cave called "The Fortress". After discussing Imperial politics, Thane asked Ciena why she frequently used the phrase "look through my eyes." Ciena then revealed that she had a twin sister named Wynnet Ree who had died a few hours after her birth.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thane_Kyrell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascThaneKyrell</string></dict>

He was an aristocrat and a descendant of the Second-wave migrants that settled on the planet Jelucan. Oris worked as an accountant during the Age of the Empire. He and his wife Ganaire lived in a grand home that was layered with gold tiles. Oris and his family attended the ceremony celebrating the Galactic Empire's Annexation of Jelucan in 11 BBY. When his wife Ganaire complained about not bringing their hovercraft, Oris responded that the hangars would be too crowded and insisted that the boys could keep up. After Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin gave a speech, Oris and his wife attended a private reception with several "Very Important Officials."[1]
            They left Dalven to babysit his younger brother Thane. However, Dalven abandoned Thane to spend time with his friends. As a result, Thane befriended a Jelucani First Waver girl named Ciena Ree. After meeting Tarkin, the two decided to aspire for careers in the Imperial Navy. Despite Thane's ambitions, Oris took little interest in the intellectual development of his younger son. He instead showered favors over his older son Dalven and even used bribery to secure Dalven a place at an Imperial Academy. By contrast, Oris treated his younger son with disdain. When Thane was fifteen years old, he even beat him up in a fit of rage. On another occasion, Oris broke up a fight between his sons after Dalven insulted Thane's friend Ciena.[1]
            Following the destruction of Alderaan, Thane deserted the Imperial Navy out of disillusionment with the Empire's brutal tactics. Thane returned to Jelucan but decided not to seek refuge with his parents. The former TIE fighter pilot did not want to endure his father's drunken contempt or his mother's outrage. In order to protect Thane, Ciena Ree, who had become a Lieutenant Commander in the Imperial Navy, filed a report claiming that Thane had committed suicide. Thane later joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After the Battle of Hoth, Oris and Ganaire were halfway across the planet on a business trip when Thane visited Jelucan to offer support to his friend Ciena, whose mother Verine Ree had been framed for embezzlement. Oris, Ganaire, and Dalven presumably believed that Thane had perished.[1]
            Oris Kyrell was a snobbish and temperamental human man who built a large house that had gold tiles. As a second-waver, he looked down upon the first wave of settlers who dwelled in Jelucan's valleys. Oris also had a hot temper and would use physical force to discipline his sons Dalven and Thane. He favored his older son Dalven over his younger son Thane. Having high hopes for Dalven, Oris used bribery to secure his older son a place at an Imperial Academy but left his younger son to do the hard work himself to attend one.[1]
            By contrast, Oris had a bad relationship with Thane. When Thane was fifteen years old, he beat up his younger son in a fit of rage. As a result, Thane developed a hatred for his father. As an adult, he did not maintain contact with his family, not wanting to endure Oris' drunken rages. On one occasion, Thane expressed anger when his friend Ciena likened him to his father. Oris was also a frequent consumer of alcoholic beverages. He frequented pubs and was known to enter into drunken rages. Despite this, Oris loved his younger son at least a little, tolerating his friendship with Ciena Ree in spite that she was a First Waver, even letting her to go to their home, and he said farewell along her wife to Thane when he left for the Imperial Academy of Coruscant.[1]
            Oris Kyrell worked as an accountant and was regarded as dishonest by his younger son Thane. [1]
            Oris Kyrell first appeared as a background character in the canon novel Lost Stars, which was written by Claudia Gray and published in 2015.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Oris_Kyrell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascOrisKyrell</string></dict>

        <key>Jarek Yeager</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.681.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jarek Yeager was a human male mechanic who owned a repair shop on the Colossus during the era of the New Republic. A former Rebel pilot and veteran of the Galactic Civil War, Yeager once served with the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After the war, he sought a quiet, peaceful life and, therefore, retired to a refueling installation located on the ocean planet Castilon in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories.
            In addition to his occupation as a mechanic and shopkeeper, Yeager was the leader of a racing team known as Team Fireball, which consisted of a younger generation of starship pilots. During the cold war, his team accepted the New Republic pilot Kazuda Xiono as the newest addition to their ranks. Although Yeager permitted Xiono to work as a member of his crew, he knew the young pilot was, in fact, a spy for the Resistance and wanted no part in their conflict with the First Order.
            During the Galactic Civil War, Jarek Yeager served as a Rebel pilot in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and later with the New Republic when he participated in the Battle of Jakku.[3] At the end of the battle, Yeager was photographed along his victorious X-wing squadron in front of the wreckage of a downed Star Destroyer.[5]
            Following the defeat of the Galactic Empire and subsequent rise of the New Republic, Yeager started a family; marrying a woman and having a daughter with her. At one point, Yeager was photographed with his family on the planet Batuu. Yeager also became a successful racer, earning the envy of his younger brother, Marcus Speedstar. During one such racing event around 24 ABY, that both Yeager and Speedstar were competing in, Speedstar used large amounts of coaxium to fuel his ship in an effort to beat Yeager. However, Speedstar's ship crashed, killing Yeager's wife and daughter, who were attending the event at the time. Furious at Speedstar's actions, Yeager ceased contact with him for many years.[6]
            At some point following the deaths of his wife and daughter, Yeager retired to the Outer Rim Territories, where he settled on the ocean planet of Castilon as a member of the Colossus community.[3] While living on the refueling station, Yeager established himself as a starship mechanic,[7] a repair shop owner, and the leader of Team Fireball — a racing team composed of a younger generation of mechanics and pilots, including Neeku Vozo and Tamara Ryvora. In addition to its organic members, Yeager's team was served by his droid R1-J5, a decrepit and obsolete astromech commonly referred to as "Bucket".[2] Yeager also at one point competed in the station's races, often winning, but by 34 ABY he no longer did so. He owned a supply of hyperfuel which he occasionally used as a boost when racing.[3]
            At the height of the cold war, the Resistance planted a spy on the Colossus in the hopes of gathering intelligence on the rising threat of the First Order. Resistance Commander Poe Dameron, who was an old friend of Yeager's, asked him to hire the spy, former New Republic pilot Kazuda Xiono, as a worker at his shop as cover. Yeager had misgivings, especially after Xiono was embroiled in a bar brawl less than an hour after arriving, but acquiesced, although he wanted nothing to do with the conflict between the Resistance and the secretive First Order.[2]
            Yeager and his team had to quickly to fix up an old racing ship, the decrepit Fireball, for Xiono to use in a solo race he had been unwillingly signed up for by the overly-eager Vozo. Ryvora was displeased, as Yeager had promised her the ship, and he told her he was doing it as a favour for a friend. Yeager was unimpressed with the used parts Xiono acquired for the ship, who hadn't had enough credits to pay for new parts. In the race the next day, Yeager warned Xiono not to fly too fast or he would cause the ship's engines to flame out. Xiono flew well, and eventually ignored the advice due to sensing victory, causing him to crash. After Xiono came to in the repair shop afterwards, Yeager took him aside and told Xiono that, although he could work on Team Fireball, Yeager had no interest in getting involved in his mission.[2]
            A short time later, Yeager and Team Fireball were hired to work on a shuttle belonging to Hallion Nark, a Neimoidian who claimed to be in a hurry. He was not impressed by Xiono taking an unnecessarily long time to fetch a part, and after Xiono accidentally made Nark lose his comlink, he promised to deduct the cost for it from Xiono's pay. Yeager was unaware that Nark was spying on the Colossus for pirate leader Kragan Gorr and his gang. During the pirates' subsequent attack, which coincided with a "triple dark" storm, Yeager took shelter with Ryvora, Vozo and Bucket in one of the platform's designated safe areas. When they returned to the repair shop, they found Xiono working on the Fireball, which he claimed to have been doing for the entire time. Yeager didn't believe Xiono when he was told that the spy had helped drive off the pirate attack.[8]
            Due to Xiono's lack of mechanical skills and experience, he struggled to adjust to life at Yeager's repair station. When Xiono failed to repair an engine, Yeager did not allow the youth to go to the races and ordered him to finish the engine by the end of the day. When a careless Xiono allowed the hoversled carrying the engine to fall overboard, Yeager chastised Xiono for being distracted by the races and warned him not to blow his cover as a spy.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jarek_Yeager</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJarekYeager</string></dict>

        <key>Skere Kaan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.684.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Skere Kaan was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order in the last years of the New Sith Wars before defecting to become a Dark Lord of the Sith and creating the Brotherhood of Darkness within the reorganized Sith Empire, earning him the nickname of the "Dark One". Ruling the Sith for a decade, Kaan's reign was turbulent as the Brotherhood was rife with civil unrest, and conflict with the Jedi saw his numbers dwindle. A few Sith were starting to question his beliefs, including Darth Bane.
            At the end of the bloody Ruusan campaign, Kaan, his followers, and much of the Jedi Army of Light were destroyed by a thought bomb of his own creation during the Seventh Battle of Ruusan. In Kaan's place, Darth Bane, who tricked the entire Brotherhood into its destruction, set up a new Sith order with the Rule of Two: one master and one apprentice.
            A Force-sensitive Human from Coruscant born during the Republic Dark Age, Skere Kaan was born a commoner before being discovered by the Jedi Order and training in the ways of the Force at the Jedi Temple. Sophisticated and knowledgeable of economic policy and fleet command, Kaan became a Jedi Knight and a beacon for hope among members of the Jedi High Council who hoped to finally destroy the reformed Sith Empire which had been plaguing the Galactic Republic for nearly two centuries.[1]
            Having perfected the art of battle meditation, Jedi Kaan was considered a valuable asset by the High Council, despite his radical belief that the Republic and the Jedi were responsible for the anarchy which plagued the galaxy. In an effort to moderate Kaan's extremist views, the High Council awarded him the title of Jedi Master. Seeing the High Council as overbearing, Kaan led a group of loyal Knights away from Coruscant and formed the Brotherhood of Darkness in 1010 BBY. Declaring himself Dark Lord of the Sith,[7] his supporters referred to him as the "Dark One."[8]
            At the time of Kaan's ascent, the Sith Empire had fractured, with dozens of Sith Lords claiming the title of Dark Lord and waging endless campaigns against each other, rather than uniting to bring down the ailing Republic. Sensing that their endless quest for supremacy and power would destroy the Sith, Kaan set about reuniting the various splinter states under his banner,[9][3] destroying all those who refused to bend the knee. The two most powerful Sith warlords—Kopecz and Qordis—pledged themselves to his cause, and they were followed by others, such as Kas'im,[3] LaTor[10] and Kaox Krul.[7]
            Still unwilling to see what was growing to become an even worse threat, the Jedi High Council issued congratulatory thanks to Kaan for killing the worst of the Sith warlords during his campaign to amass power. However, Kaan had not been able to lull all Jedi into a state of ignorance; indeed Jedi Lord Hoth saw Kaan for the threat he was and left Coruscant to gather his own forces.[1]
            His idea of cooperation and equality among the Sith Lords was unique in their history. Rather than challenge each of the self-proclaimed "Dark Lords" and threaten the war effort, Kaan acquiesced to their vanity, and named them all "Dark Lord of the Sith", and declared "All are equal in the Brotherhood of Darkness."[3][2] But he forbade any Sith to take the historic title of Darth, since he held that title as being solely responsible for the jealousy and infighting that had destroyed the Sith in the past.[3]
            With his charisma and power, the Sith struck back at the Republic and the Jedi Order. However, the Republic and the Order were not without their defenders. Having seen Kaan for what he truly was, Lord Hoth of the Jedi Order rallied the banners of the Jedi Grand Council and formed the Army of Light through the support of all standing Jedi Lords. Once amassed, Hoth led his armies on a hunt for Sith, a decade-long war that would see great casualties on both sides.[1] Although the conflict was widely regarded as an all-out war, the Republic claimed that it was simply fighting a series of engagements against an illegal organization.[3]
            Despite Hoth's best efforts, a startling early victory at the Battle of Korriban enabled the Sith to retake their ancestral homeworld. Kaan authorized the reopening of the Sith Academy there, and placed Qordis in charge to begin training the next generation of warriors. The reinvigorated Sith pushed the Jedi back, winning great victories against the Army of Light. Kaan proved to be a brilliant strategist, and an excellent tactician, capable of winning victory after victory against the Jedi forces; all the while putting his charisma to good use by luring many Jedi to serve him.[3]
            While Kaan was a charismatic and skilled general, his rule was more fragile than it seemed, a weakness that would be exploited as the war ground on. As long as the victories continued, however, the Sith would remain united behind him.[3]
            Kaan tried to provoke Hoth into a confrontation, laying waste to worlds such as Bespin, Sullust, and Taanab, but his main strategy seemed to have already been to push towards the Core Worlds, with Sith armies seizing Kashyyyk as a staging-ground in the Mid Rim, and winning battles on Trandosha and Phaseera.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Skere_Kaan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSkereKaan</string></dict>

He was a member of several important and influential organizations within the Empire such as the specialized Imperial Demonstration Team, and Onyx Squadron. He was also the pilot of Darth Vader's shuttle prior to the Battle of Endor.
            Yorr was a Human male who at some point before the Battle of Endor was a member of a specialized group within the Imperial Military known as the Imperial Demonstration Team. He also served as a test pilot on various TIE prototype starfighters. Yorr became a member of a starfighter squadron within in the Imperial Navy known as Onyx Squadron. During his time with Onyx squadron Yorr's call sign was Onyx 2, and he served alongside his wingman Colonel Jendon. He had scored at least twenty-four combat victories while he was still part of Onyx squadron.[3] Because of the devastating blow to the Empire in the Battle of Yavin, Yorr was among the thousands of Imperial Academy cadets who were rapidly advanced into service.[4]
            In 4 ABY Captain Yorr was the pilot of Darth Vader's shuttle, ST 321, on its way to the Imperial superweapon, Death Star II.[1] Upon arriving at the station Yorr and his copilot Jendon made final readings, monitored descent functions. It was a sequence they'd each performed a thousand times. Yorr requested clearance to land and transmitted the transmission code. The port controller, Endicott, said that the shield would be deactivated when the code was confirmed. Biting the inside of his cheek and smiling nervously at Jendon, Yorr told him to hurry saying that their passenger was in no mood to wait.[5]
            Yorr was a Human male with brown hair and brown eyes. He had a light skin completion.[1] Yorr was worried about how Vader might react while having to wait to land, and was afraid to look at the Dark Lord himself during the flight.[5]
            Yorr made his first appearance in the novelization of Return of the Jedi. Yorr appeared in Richard Marquand's 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, where he was portrayed by actor Jasper Jacob. Jasper spent two days filming his work during March 1982. Jasper had a hard time memorizing his dialog. This lead to them having to do many takes, but director Richard Marquand was very understanding. The scene Jasper appears in as Yorr was cut down to only a few lines.[6] The script for Return of the Jedi is featured on Star Wars: Behind the Magic where Yorr is mentioned.[7] He would also be featured in the junior novel as well.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yorr</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascYorr</string></dict>
        <key>Yeleb</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.686.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Yeleb, also known as "Yeleb the Protector" or "Protector Yeleb," was a male human who settled on the planet Vyndal and joined a village built there. After finding a lightsaber, Yeleb was named protector of the village, and tried his hardest to defend its people. When the Jedi Kanan Jarrus was forced to land on Vyndal he was brought before Yeleb, who tried to attack him with the lightsaber for claiming he was not a real Jedi. After Jarrus was able to avoid the attacks and save a local woman from a falling branch, Yeleb revealed to Jarrus where he had acquired the blade. The village was then visited by the Galactic Empire, and forces led by the Grand Inquisitor arrived looking for Jarrus. When Yeleb refused to reveal his location, the Inquisitor attacked him, but despite Jarrus coming to Yeleb's aid, he was fatally wounded. Jarrus managed to trick the Imperials into leaving the world, after which Yeleb died from his wounds.
            At some point during his life, the human male Yeleb landed on the planet Vyndal and began living amongst a village of Non-Humans. While searching around the planet, he discovered a crashed Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor with a dead Jedi pilot inside. Yeleb took her lightsaber and brought it to the village chief claiming that he was a Jedi and knew how to use it. The Chief declared Yeleb the village protector, causing the villagers to call him Protector Yeleb or Yeleb the Protector. Using the weapon Yeleb defended the village from all threats.[1]
            Many years after Yeleb first arrive on Vyndal, the Jedi Kanan Jarrus was forced to land the attack shuttle Phantom on Vyndal after being attacked by Imperial TIE/ln space superiority starfighters. Jarrus was found by a woman from  Yeleb's village and her son, and once Jarrus had recovered from the rough landing Yeleb instructed her to bring the stranger before him and the villagers in one of the village's buildings. As the protector could not discern Jarrus's nature from meeting him, Yeleb activated his lightsaber to determine the truth. Surprised to see a lightsaber in the hands of someone other than a Jedi, Jarrus requested he and Yeleb speak in private. Yeleb refused until Jarrus claimed to have discovered his secret, at which point the pair moved outside. When Jarrus claimed Yeleb was not a true Jedi, the protector tried to attack him with his lightsaber; however, Jarrus was able to dodge each blow.[1]
            The pair were interrupted by the woman that had initially found Jarrus, who claimed Yeleb was needed back inside. Jarrus then managed to save the woman from a falling branch, causing her to question why Yeleb had not tried to help. Once the woman was gone, Yeleb revealed his past to Jarrus and begged him not to expose him to the village as a fraud. The sound of two Gozanti-class cruisers landing nearby then alerted the pair to the arrival of the Galactic Empire on the planet. Seeing that the Imperials were led by the Grand Inquisitor, a Pau'an who was there to hunt him, Jarrus tried to come up with a plan, but Yeleb insisted that as protector he should speak with the Imperials and pretend Jarrus was not there. Despite Jarrus warning how dangerous the Inquisitor, Yeleb went ahead with his plan and greeted the Imperials, lying about not having seen Jarrus. The Inquisitor saw through Yeleb's lie, and when the protector ordered the Imperials to leave the Pau'an ordered his stormtroopers to destroy Yeleb's village.[1]
            Jarrus then revealed himself and attacked the Inquisitor, with Yeleb soon joining the combat. Using the Force, the Pau'an pushed Jarrus out of the combat, allowing him to focus on Yeleb and slash the man across the chest with his blade. Seeing Yeleb fall, Jarrus fled from the Inquisitor to draw him away from the wounded man. The Pau'an gave chase along with his stormtroopers, and Jarrus was able to trick the Imperials into believing he had left Vyndal on one of their cruisers, causing them to leave the planet in the other. With the threat gone, the villagers were able to gather round the dying Yeleb, and after Jarrus reassured him that his actions had been worthy of a Jedi, he passed away in the arms of the local woman who had earlier been saved by Jarrus.[1]
            Yeleb lied to the village he lived in about being a Jedi and knowing how to use a lightsaber, but did his best to protect his fellow villagers. Despite this lie, Yeleb claimed that he kept no secrets from the people he protected, refusing to speak with Jarrus in private until the Jedi hinted that he knew Yeleb was not really a Jedi. Yeleb's actions also did not always befit a Jedi, as he tried to use his lightsaber to make Jarrus tell the truth, and attacked him when the Jedi claimed Yeleb was lying. After revealing the truth to Jarrus he begged that his secret not be revealed, as he believed it cause the villagers to suffer. When the Inquisitor arrived, Yeleb chose to try and lie to the Inquisitor despite Jarrus's warning that the Imperials were dangerous. He then attacked the Inquisitor for calling him a liar, but due to his poor skills with a lightsaber, received a mortal wound. As he died, Yeleb blamed himself for what had happened, but Jarrus reassured him that he had been a good man which the protector thanked him for with his last words.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yeleb</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascYeleb</string></dict>

        <key>Imanuel Doza</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.689.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Imanuel Doza was a human male who served as a captain in the Galactic Empire around the time of the Battle of Endor before defecting. By the time of the cold war, he operated as captain of the refueling station Colossus during the era of the New Republic.[1] His daughter with a female Rebel pilot was Torra Doza, a young Ace pilot who resided with her father in the station's upper levels.[5]
            Imanuel Doza was an Imperial officer who held the rank of captain[6] during the reign of the Galactic Empire.[2] However, Doza defected from the Imperial Military around the time of the Battle of Endor.[7] Following the end of the Galactic Civil War, Doza married a former Rebel pilot[8] and had a daughter, Torra. Doza and his daughter eventually lived on Castilon's Colossus refueling platform, where he eventually became the station's operator.[9]
            In 34 ABY,[3] Doza announced to Colossus' residents that their fuel supply had to be rationed for the next 100 hours. However, residents such as "Aunt Z" believed that he was behind the power outage and that Doza had power in his tower. Doza was believed to be part of the First Order and sneaking their ships in at night. [5]
            When the power came back on, Major Elrik Vonreg arrived and Doza invited him to his office. There, Doza asked the baron what he wanted. Major Vonreg and the First Order wanted to offer him "protection" in order to assist Ace Squadron in keeping Colossus safe from the escalating pirate attacks. Despite Colossus being vulnerable without it's fuel supply, Doza rejected Vonreg's offer and threatened to report this coercion to the New Republic. Vonreg also threatened to report Doza's dealing with the criminal underworld to the New Republic. Despite the new threat, Doza refused Vonreg's bribe and told him that he would have to do better.[5]
            Unbeknowst to both of them, they were being monitored by the still new Resistance spy Kazuda Xiono. Xiono believed that Doza was going to make a deal with the First Order and that he was their mole. Doza demanded to know what Vonreg's stormtroopers were doing and was told that a spy had listened in on their conversation. Doza and his daughter were shocked upon hearing this. His daughter told him that it was just one of her friends stopping by and Doza believed her. Doza made it clear that he did not like the First Order accusing Colossus' citizens of espionage and that he trusted his daughter and the citizens.[5]
            After the First Order left, Doza looked over the security footage and saw Xiono. He wondered who Xiono was.[5]
            Later, Captain Doza sent 4D-1MN to summon Xiono for a meeting with him. Doza knew him as Yeager's mechanic, Torra's challenger in a race. After exchanging pleasantries, Doza questioned Xinono about his interest in the two missing children Kel and Eila, whom the First Order had placed a bounty on.[10]
            Kaz showed Captain Doza Kel's charm and asked why they were on the run. Doza responded that mercenaries usually did not ask questions. When Kaz replied that he was not a mercenary, Doza asked Kaz to consider who would place such a bounty on two missing children and why. Kaz responded that he only wanted the children to get home safely. Satisfied at Xiono's motives, Doza told 4D to escort Kaz out.[10]
            In private, Doza contacted Captain Phasma via hologram and asked why the First Order would place such a large bounty on two children. Phasma claimed that Kel and Eila were from a wealthy and powerful family in the First Order. Doza confirmed that the children were on the platform and also reminded Phasma to ensure that First Order visitors respect local law on the Colossus.[10]
            In truth, Kel and Eila were the survivors of a First Order massacre on Tehar. First Order forces under Commander Pyre arrived to hunt them down, with orders to recruit them or to kill if they refused. However, Xiono helped the children escape by staging their deaths. Kel and Eila subsequently found refuge among the Chelidae engineers and mechanics on the engineering deck.[10]
            Later, Captain Doza hired Jarek Yeager and his Team Fireball to repair and upgrade the station aerial defense system's tracking computer. Since Ace Squadron was escorting an important supply shipment, Doza told Yeager to have the weapons system ready within the next three hours.[11]
            While Yeager's mechanics were searching for a CoMar Tri-Tracker chip, Doza met with Yeager inside Doza Tower. He told Yeager that they had to get the cannons online within an hour. Doza expressed his concerns about the improved tactics and equipment of the pirates. Yeager tried to reassure Doza by promising that his team would have the cannons online within the hour. However, they were spied upon by the pirate spy Synara San, who deduced that the Colossus' aerial defense system was down and contacted Kragan Gorr. Kragan's Warbird gang launched a second raid on the Colossus.[11]
            During the attack, Captain Doza dispatched two security teams to the loading docks. As the platform burned, Doza contacted Yeager by comlink and demanded to know when his cannons would be online. Yeager responded that his team was working on it. After fighting off Kragan and his gang, Yeager and Xiono managed to install the tracking computer. With the anti-aircraft systems activated, Doza was able to drive away the pirate ships with the anti-aircraft guns.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imanuel_Doza</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascImanuelDoza</string></dict>
        <key>Chirrut Îmwe</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.690.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Chirrut Îmwe was a blind human male born on the moon Jedha in 52 BBY. One of the Guardians of the Whills, an order of spiritual warrior-monks, he was active during the days of the Galactic Empire and worked as an itinerant preacher in Jedha City. Alongside his friend and protector, Baze Malbus, Îmwe became part of a volunteer group of Rebels tasked with stealing the plans of the first Death Star. Îmwe died during the Battle of Scarif in 0 BBY after assisting Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor in breaking into the Imperial archives.
            Born in 52 BBY, Chirrut Îmwe lived on the moon Jedha where he became a member of the Guardians of the Whills alongside his longtime friend Baze Malbus.[2] In 1 BBY, one year before they joined the Rebellion, Îmwe's voice was heard by Padawan Ezra Bridger in a place that existed between time and space.[5]
            Shortly after Saw Gerrera arrived on Jedha, Chirrut and Baze were approached by Beezer Fortuna, one of Saw's top men. They agreed to join on the condition that the orphanage that their friends ran would get any and all supplies they needed. The partisans greatly underestimated Chirrut's abilities, leaving him out of many missions, until Chirrut proved to them he was of value. As Saw's attacks increased, the Empire began to hurt the citizens of Jedha more. This resulted in more orphans, which meant they needed more supplies, Chirrut and Baze knew that they could not let the orphans remain here, so they struck a deal with the partisans to steal an Imperial Sentinel ship. However, as they put their plan into motion, Beezer and two other partisans betrayed Chirrut and Baze, attempting the steal the ship for themselves to use it as a giant explosive against the Imperial Star Destroyer that hovered above the city. Chirrut managed to convince Beezer that their movement would gain no more traction if word got out that Saw prevented the escape of the orphans. Ceding to Chirrut's rationale, Beezer surrendered the ship to them. This ended their relationship with Saw, however, leaving them on very bad terms.[4]
            Nineteen years after Sheev Palpatine turned the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, Îmwe was outside preaching of the Force when he met Jyn Erso. He asked her if she knew what Kyber crystals were after sensing she had one on her necklace; she told him that they were what powered a Jedi's lightsaber. She then left with Captain Cassian Andor.[2]
            Later on, during a skirmish that took place in Jedha City, Îmwe helped free Andor, Erso and the droid K-2SO from a group of stormtroopers. Using his highly trained hearing to determine the positions of the approaching troopers, he attacked them with his staff, knocking them all down in quick succession. Then Malbus shot and killed stormtrooper reinforcements approaching from behind Îmwe. After learning why Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor were there, a group of Saw Gerrera's insurgents came and placed sacks on all their heads, to which Îmwe remarked with annoyance because he was already blind and could not see where they were taking him anyway.[2]
            They were taken to Gerrera's hideout and placed into a cell. In the cell Îmwe repeated the phrase, "I am one with the Force. The Force is with me." Malbus didn't believe that Îmwe's praying would work to open the cell door. Îmwe asked Andor if he had been in any other cells before to which Andor told him it was his first one. He told him there was more than one type of cell and that he sensed that Andor carried his around with him everywhere he went. Îmwe then sensed that there was someone in the cell beside them. It turned out to be the Ex-Imperial Pilot Bodhi Rook. They eventually made their escape as the Jedha City was attacked by the Empire's superweapon, the Death Star. Îmwe made his escape with the others aboard the U-wing.[2]
            While on board the U-Wing, Îmwe questioned Malbus about the holy city to which he told him that it had been completely destroyed. Jyn told Andor about the weakness that her father had placed in the Death Star and the group made their way to Eadu. Once on the planet, Andor and Rook went out to scout the refinery. After asking Baze if Andor looked like a killer, Baze told him that he looked like a friend. Erso questioned this and Îmwe told her that the Force flows darkly around a creature that is about to kill. Fearing that Andor was going to kill her father she went out in search of him. Moments prior to Erso's departure, K-2SO recalled that Andor's weapon was set in its sniper configuration, supporting Erso's fear that Andor was planning to kill her father. Îmwe later followed Erso. Baze soon followed. Baze and Îmwe stopped at a ridge to get a good look at things. Once the Rebel fighters arrived, Îmwe used his lightbow to take down a TIE Fighter which crashed into a turbo laser tower. Soon after Baze and Îmwe made their way to the shuttle that K-2SO had stolen and made their way to Yavin 4.[2]
            After the Alliance Council had told Jyn Erso that they could not afford to send the Rebel Fleet to Scarif, Îmwe was among those who chose to fight with her. Once they arrived on the planet, Îmwe and Malbus were put in charge of an assault team that would set charges to lure out the stormtroopers. After taking out several troopers, they made their way to the entrance to the complex. Îmwe and Malbus held the line with other Rebels until All Terrain Armored Cargo Transports arrived at their position. Îmwe and the others ran for shelter. After learning that the master switch needed to be flipped for the Rebels to receive the Death Star plans, he made his way out onto the battle field to activate the switch, continuing to repeat the chant, "I am one with the Force. The Force is with me." Managing to not be hit by any blaster bolts, Chirrut activated the switch as a fuel container was hit by Imperial blaster fire and an explosion occurred, sending him flying backwards. Malbus, seeing his friend injured ran onto the battlefield to help, firing at every trooper. Îmwe soon died in his friend's arms, but told Malbus not to grieve: if Malbus looked to the Force, he would always be able to find him.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chirrut_%C3%8Emwe</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascChirrutImwe</string></dict>

Although most of the lightstations scattered throughout the nebula were autonomous, it was Yeldarb's duty—along with the Roon Trade Guild—to ensure that pirates would not interfere with the lightstations' positions and draw unsuspecting travelers into a trap. The responsibility had been forced upon him by the nefarious Governor Koong, who had enslaved many natives of Roon.
            It was during Yeldarb's tenure aboard the Umboo Lightstation that Mungo Baobab's Caravel was intercepted and captured by Koong, mistaking the explorer for Terrinald Screed. With Baobab's help, Yeldarb was able to escape the governor's grip and, in grateful return, point the treasure-hunter and his droid companions, R2-D2 and C-3PO, in the direction of the Roon system.

        <key>Eli Vanto</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.692.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Eli Vanto was a human male who initially served as an ensign and later a commander in the Imperial Navy during the era of the Galactic Empire. For several years, Vanto served as a translator, aide, student, and protégé of the Chiss known as Thrawn, who became a rising star in the Imperial Navy. Vanto served alongside Thrawn in several Imperial military operations against smugglers and insurgents. Due to his close friendship and loyalty to Thrawn, Vanto's promotion was overlooked for several years by the Imperial Military hierarchy which despised aliens and looked down on Wild Space outsiders like Vanto.
            Following the intervention of the future Lothalian Governor Arihnda Pryce and Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, Vanto received his long overdue promotion and eventually rose to the rank of Commander. While pursuing the shadowy insurgent leader known as Nightswan, Eli discovered evidence that the Empire was transporting large quantities of doonium and other precious metals for a mysterious mega project which turned out to be the first Death Star. Following the defeat of Nightswan during the Batonn sector insurgency, Commander Vanto was dispatched by Thrawn into the Unknown Regions to serve as the Empire's attache to the Chiss Ascendancy.
            Eli Vanto grew up on Lysatra, a planet found in Wild Space, where his parents owned a shipping company that operated in the Unknown Regions. Because of this, Vanto spent a lot of time picking up several languages, one of which was Sy Bisti. In later years, he became a cadet at the Myomar Academy in the Expansion Region and was on track to becoming a supply officer.[1]
            Near the end of his training at the Myomar Academy, Vanto and his fellow cadets were part of an Imperial scouting party led by Colonel Mosh Barris and Captain Voss Parck. While pursuing smugglers, they explored an uncharted planet in Wild Space. During the expedition, Vanto and Captain Parck were summoned by Colonel Barris to investigate a hut which did not appear to match anything of known design. The Imperial scouting party also found eight boxes near the hut that were inscribed in an unknown language which turned out to be Sy Bisti. Since the Imperial droids could not decipher Sy Bisti, Vanto was tasked with translating the script.[1]
            The Imperial party proceeded to set up camp around the hut but were attacked by an unknown assailant, who killed five Imperial Navy troopers and a stormtrooper. The attacker also downed a V-wing starfighter and killed the starfighter's pilot in order to study his adversaries and the craft's communications equipment. Despite the confusion, Vanto was able to determine the attacker was a humanoid and speculated that he had possibly been stranded on the planet since the Clone Wars. Due to the attack, a decision was made to evacuate the hut and everything in it aboard the orbiting Venator-class Star Destroyer Strikefast.[1]
            Once aboard the Strikefast, Captain Parck realized that the attacker had stowed aboard their transport and ordered that the hangar lights be dimmed. To the surprise of Eli and the others, the attacker surrendered himself to the ship's stormtroopers. Eli recognized the intruder as a Chiss man, a blue-skinned species whom Vanto had regarded as a Wild Space myth. In his childhood, Vanto had heard stories of the Chiss and that they used the Sy Bisti language. While the Chiss could understand both Sy Bisti and Galactic Basic, he was more proficient in the former. Since Vanto knew Sy Bisti, Captain Parck tasked him with serving as a translator between his Imperial superiors and the Chiss prisoner. The Chiss introduced himself as Mitth'raw'nuruodo, but allowed Vanto and his superior officers to call him "Thrawn".[1]
            During the interrogation, Thrawn admitted attacking and killing Imperial personnel on the uncharted world in order to test the mettle of his Imperial opponents. Thrawn also claimed that he been exiled by his people for launching a preemptive attack on an unidentified foe. Thrawn explained that he had come to seek the Empire's help in protecting his people from various mysterious dangers in the Unknown Regions. Due to his knowledge of the Chiss and Sy Bisti, Captain Parck realized that Vanto was cut out to be more than a supply officer and appointed him as Thrawn's translator. Recognizing Thrawn's potential, Parck decided to take Thrawn to the galactic capital Coruscant, believing that the Emperor Palpatine would be interested in the Chiss warrior.[1]
            For the rest of the journey, Vanto spent time alone with Thrawn and briefed him about the Empire and his own upbringing on Lysatra. The Emperor was indeed interested in meeting the Chiss warrior. He summoned Thrawn, Eli, Captain Parck, Colonel Barris, and the other stormtrooper and Imperial Navy witnesses for a private audience at the Imperial Palace. During the meeting, Thrawn claimed that there were unspecified dangers lurking in the Unknown Regions and offered his skills, knowledge, and service to the Empire in return for receiving a guarantee of protection for his people. The Emperor accepted Thrawn's offer to serve as his advisor on matters relating to the Unknown Regions. Thrawn also managed to persuade the Emperor to permanently assign Eli as his translator and aide.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eli_Vanto</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascEliVanto</string></dict>
        <key>Idel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.693.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Idel was a human male who served as a commodore in the Imperial Navy and commanded his own Imperial-class Star Destroyer. He led a trio of Imperial Star Destroyers to recapture Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine's luxury pleasure craft, the Imperialis, after it was stolen from Orbital Shipyard CC-24 in the Castell system. Idel destroyed the shipyard and then attempted to use gravity mines to capture the Imperialis.
            When that failed, he offered a million-credit reward to whomever brought him the Imperialis, causing the other two Star Destroyers—commanded by Captains Conro and Shan—to try and use their vessels' tractor beams to capture the yacht. The smuggler Lando Calrissian, who was piloting the Imperialis, maneuvered the yacht so that the two Star Destroyers collided, allowing the Imperialis to escape. Realizing he had failed the Emperor, Idel shot himself in the head.
            During the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Commodore Idel served in the Imperial Navy and commanded his own Imperial-class Star Destroyer. After a group of thieves led by the smuggler Lando Calrissian managed to board and steal Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine's pleasure yacht, the Imperialis, from Sienar Fleet Systems' Orbital Shipyard CC-24 space station in the Castell system, Idel was assigned to recover the vessel on the Emperor's orders.[1]
            In addition to his own vessel, Idel was given command over the Star Destroyers belonging to Captains Shan and Conro for the mission, and the trio arrived in the Castell system before the Imperialis could escape. The commodore contacted his two subordinates via hologram once above the shipyard and briefed them of their mission before commencing the task by ordering his gunners to destroy the space station in order to make an example of those who failed the Emperor.[1]
            Once the Star Destroyers' turbolasers had reduced CC-24 to space dust, Idel turned his attention to the yacht. Ordering Shan and Conro to stand by while he handled the thieves, the commodore had his Star Destroyer release a pair of gravity mines, which would latch onto the Imperialis and prevent it from jumping to hyperspace. However, the yacht's automated defense system quickly destroyed the mines, prompting Idel to offer a million credits to whichever captain could capture the ship first.[1]
            Keen to claim Idel's promised reward, both Shan and Conro moved to capture the Imperialis with their vessels' tractor beams. However, Calrissian, who was piloting the yacht, maneuvered the the Imperialis between the two Star Destroyers, causing the two Imperial vessels' beams to lock onto each other instead. The captains realized their mistake too late, and their ships were pulled together into a collision while the Imperialis fled the system. Having witnessed the utter failure of his mission unfold before him, Idel chose to end his own life rather than face the Emperor's wrath. After advising his crew that they might consider defecting to the Rebel Alliance, he took his blaster pistol and shot himself in the head.[1]
            Idel was confident that he would be able to reclaim the Imperialis with ease upon reaching the Castell system and had his two supporting captains hold back while he tried to capture the vessel on his own. However, when Shan questioned the need for three vessels on such a mission, the commodore pointed out that it was the Emperor's orders and told the captain to focus on the mission.[1]
            After Idel's gravity mine scheme failed, his confidence was shaken to the point that he was willing to offer a large sum of credits to the captain that succeeded in capturing the yacht. After the Imperialis escaped due to the incompetence of Shan and Conro, Idel chose to commit suicide over the failure, avoiding whatever punishment the Emperor might have in store. A human, the mustachioed Idel had blond hair, fair skin, and brown eyes, with a scar running across his right eye socket.[1]
            Idel wore a gray Imperial officer's uniform and carried a blaster pistol while aboard the bridge of his Star Destroyer.[1]
            Idel was created for the 2015 comic book Lando, Part II, which was written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Alex Maleev.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Idel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascIdel</string></dict>

In 34 ABY, he was on the bridge of the Raddus with Admiral Gial Ackbar and General Leia Organa during the evacuation of the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar and died when the First Order destroyed the bridge in an attack on the fleet after it exited hyperspace following the lightspeed jump from D'Qar.
            Idrosen Gawat was a human male who led the planetary defense forces responsible for patrolling the Mykapo system. After decades of experience, Gawat retired from the defense force, but returned to action in his seventies when he joined the Resistance in order to oppose the First Order.[3] When open war broke out against the First Order[2] in the year 34 ABY,[1] Gawat was captain and executive officer of the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus.[3]
            The Raddus was the largest of four vessels used to evacuated the Resistance personnel from their base on the planet D'Qar.[2] As the Resistance transported its last personnel off the world, the First Order fleet arrived and attacked, but after the Resistance's forces successfully destroyed the First Order Dreadnought[2] Fulminatrix,[3] the Raddus successfully jumped to lightspeed with the rest of the Resistance forces and escaped.[2]
            Much to the surprise of the Resistance's commanders, the First Order managed to track them through lightspeed and quickly caught up with them and attacked after the Raddus and other vessels exited hyperspace. Gawat was killed along with almost everyone else on board the primary bridge of the Raddus when two TIE/fo space superiority fighters successfully struck the bridge with missiles. Those who were not killed in the initial blast were sucked out into the vacuum of space, with only General Leia Organa managing to survive the ordeal.[2]
            Gawat had tanned skin, brown eyes and white hair.[2] After retiring, he was not quite ready to hang up his rank badge and so joined the Resistance in order to put his decades of experience to good use.[3]
            While on the Raddus, Gawat wore a brown, brimoss-fibre uniform tunic with black Fleet officer's uniform trousers, a brown belt and a pair of dark brown service boots.[3]
            Idrosen Gawat was portrayed by Togo Igawa in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi,[2] which was released on December 15, 2017.[5] The character was not named in the film,[2] but received identification in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo[3] and released in conjunction with the film.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Idrosen_Gawat</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascIdrosenGawat</string></dict>

In 4 ABY, the Jedi Luke Skywalker surrendered himself to Igar shortly before the Battle of Endor. Igar presented the prisoner to the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who then ordered the commander to search the surrounding area for Skywalker's allies.
            Igar was a human male who served the Galactic Empire as an Imperial Army commander during its Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He was stationed on the moon Endor as one of the commanding officers of a garrison assigned to protect an Imperial command bunker.[2] The bunker housed an SLD-26 planetary shield generator that was used to defend the Death Star II superweapon while it was under construction in orbit over the moon.[3]
            In 4 ABY,[4] the Alliance sent a strike team to Endor to try and destroy the shield generator in preparation for an all out assault on the Death Star. Before the attack on the bunker began, the rebel Jedi Luke Skywalker purposefully surrendered himself to Igar[1] while the officer was on patrol,[5] in hope of being brought to his own father, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he hoped to redeem. Igar questioned Skywalker as to whether there were other rebels nearby, but the Jedi lied and told the commander he was alone.[1]
            Igar then rode with Skywalker in a All Terrain Armored Transport to the bunker's landing pad, where Vader landed in order to meet them. The commander exited the walker with his prisoner and three stormtroopers onto one of the pad's walkways and then handed Skywalker and the Jedi's lightsaber over to the Sith. He then requested permission to search the surrounding area for Skywalker's allies, having not believed his prisoner's lie.[1]
            Vader congratulated the commander then ordered him to search as he had requested, so Igar re-boarded the walker with the stormtroopers, leaving father and son alone on the walkway. Shortly after Igar's capture of Skywalker, the rebels attacked the shield bunker and managed to get inside, only to discover that Empire has prepared for their arrival and set up a trap. Despite this, the rebels ultimately managed to destroy the command bunker and shield generator, allowing the Alliance Fleet above the planet to destroy the Death Star.[1]
            Igar had fair skin, brown hair and blue eyes. When Luke Skywalker lied about not having any allies with him on Endor, Igar saw through the lie and requested permission to hunt the rebels from Vader.[1] He was initially smug when presenting Skywalker to Vader, but became less smug by the time he returned to the walker.[5]
            Igar wore a gray officer's uniform including a cap, belt and boots. He rode in an All Terrain Armored Transport while on Endor.[1]
            Igar first appeared in the 1983 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. He was portrayed uncredited[1] by actor William Hoyland in the film. The character was first named in the current canon in the 2015 reference book Ultimate Star Wars,[3] with the name originating on a card in the 1999 Star Wars Legends Star Wars Customizable Card Game in the Endor Limited set.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Igar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascIgar</string></dict>

            Zuma was a male Human living during the New Republic who had considerable Force-sensitivity. Zuma trained at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, becoming a Archivist and a Jedi Knight. He took an apprentice, Toro Irana, who was often frustrated by Zuma's lack of desire for accomplishment and heroism. When Irana died under suspicious circumstances on Makem Te, Zuma went to investigate the death.[2]
            Zuma's path led him to encounter Reen Irana, his Padawan's sister, who was also investigating the death. They soon learned that Irana had been connected to a drug called Scourge.[2]
            Mander Zuma was more at home in the Jedi Archives than in the field, so his combat skills were rusty, coupled with his own doubts of whether he could be a successful Jedi. Mander was able to use telekinesis, Force speed, and mind tricks, but was also susceptible to the latter, following his apprentice's suggestion to lower his blade. Juxtaposed to this weakness, he was very knowledgeable about mind tricks and how to counter them; with Empty Meditation. He wasn't the best at blast deflection, nor lightsaber dueling for that matter, being quickly disarmed by the inexperienced Mika the Hutt. Many even noted that he was not what they expected, when meeting him, further feeding his feelings of self-doubt. However, Mander was described as strong in the Force, and after he defeated Mika, erased his mental hang-ups and felt his former apprentice's blue lightsaber in his hand as an extension of his own.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mander_Zuma</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascManderZuma</string></dict>
        <key>Zumgi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.697.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zumgi was a member of the Ranc gang. He served under the leadership of Wenda and Bett before transferring his allegiance to Terex. Zumgi had a great deal of respect for Terex and regarded Wisper as a steward. After Terex returned to reclaim ownership of the Ranc gang in 34 ABY, Zumgi killed Wisper. Zumgi then took part in the hunt for Poe Dameron.
            Zumgi lived during the New Republic Era. He was a member of the Ranc gang, which was based on the Outer Rim world of Kaddak and led by Wenda and Bett. In 7 ABY, he and the other members of the Ranc gang entered the Rothana Imperial Shipyards with the former stormtroopers Corlac and Terex. Terex managed to use his knowledge of the base to help the gang take over the abandoned shipyards.[1] Corlac along with Wenda and Bett wanted to build a pirate empire. After Terex killed Corlac, Wenda, and Bett, Zumgi joined Wisper, Brrang, and the others in transferring their allegiance to Terex.[3]
            When Terex left the gang to join the First Order, Wisper took over leadership of the Ranc gang. While Wisper made the gang rich, he never commanded the same level of respect as Terex. In 34 ABY, Terex returned to take back leadership of the Ranc gang. When Wisper objected and tried to reassert his authority over the gang, Zumgi shot him dead with a blaster. Zumgi told Terex that they were all very excited to receive his call and welcomed him back to the gang. Terex thanked him for his loyalty.[1] The gang then took control of Terex's starship Carrion Spike from his First Order crew.[3]
            Under Terex's orders, Zumgi made sure that the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron and the droids BB-8, N1-ZX, and C-3PO escaped Kaddak with little resistance. Zumgi and his men prevented the mob from taking the bounty on Poe's head by breaking a few skulls. Terex reassured Zumgi that their plan was working and that Poe was a resourceful enemy. Terex's plan was to use N1-ZX to track Poe back to the Resistance base and destroy it. Zumgi and Brrang were present when Terex opened a garage full of "Uglies".[3]
            After bringing the Ranc fleet into space, Zumgi told Terex that he was glad to have him back. Terex reassured Zumgi that he and the other Rancs were his family. Since they were tracking Poe's T-70 X-wing starfighter which had already entered hyperspace, Terex instructed Zumgi to prepare the fleet and let him know when Poe reentered realspace. When Zumgi asked if he did not want to supervise the operation, Terex told Zumgi that he had more faith in the Ranc gang than in the bureaucratic First Order.[2]
            While Zumgi was roaming through the ship's corridors, he was accosted by the Abednedo Resistance technician Oddy Muva, who had come to rescue his wife Sowa Chuan from Terex. Oddy claimed to be a technician who had accidentally stowed aboard. Zumgi realized that he was lying because he had a blaster in his holster. Zumgi drew a vibroblade and managed to damage Oddy's blaster. However, Oddy kicked him in the torso. When Zumgi taunted his opponent, Oddy Muva responded that he had come to rescue his wife and punched Zumgi under the chin, knocking him to the ground. Oddy then held the vibroblade against his neck and demanded to know where his wife was.[2]
            Oddy forced Zumgi at gunpoint to lead him to Terex's harem. Zumgi watched as Oddy and Sowa embraced and learned that Terex kept a harem of slaves in order to blackmail people into spying for him. When Oddy ordered Zumgi to call Terex in order to settle scores with him, Zumgi replied that everyone who tried to fight Terex lost. Smirking, he told Oddy that Terex was no longer aboard the ship but was leading a boarding party to hunt down Poe Dameron on a desert world.[4]
            The Ranc gang was later caught up in a battle with Poe's Black Squadron. The Carrion Spike and the Ranc fleet was subsequently destroyed by First Order forces which had been sent to chastise Poe for disobeying orders not to engage with the New Republic and Resistance. It is unknown whether Zumgi perished or survived the battle.[5]
            Zumgi was a dark-skinned human man with gray eyes and black hair. In his younger days, he had black hair on top of his head.[1] By 34 ABY, he only had black mutton chops.[2] Zumgi was loyal to Terex and regarded him as a better leader than Wisper. Zumgi knew how to shoot a blaster, which he killed Wisper with.[1] As one of Terex's lieutenants, Zumgi knew how to break a few skulls.[3] Zumgi knew how to wield a vibroblade but was outmatched by the Abednedo Resistance agent Oddy Muva.[2] Even in captivity, Zumgi remained smug and defiant and believed Oddy had little chance of beating Terex on his own.[2]
            Zumgi first appeared in the 2016 comic Poe Dameron 9: The Gathering Storm, Part II, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Phil Noto.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zumgi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZumgi</string></dict>

        <key>Kazuda Xiono</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.699.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kazuda Xiono, nicknamed "Kaz," was a human male military pilot who served the New Republic in the years following the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War. The son of Senator Hamato Xiono, Kazuda served with the Starfighter Corps of the New Republic Defense Fleet during the cold war, at which point the Resistance recruited him to spy on the First Order. As a result, he was sent to the Colossus—an independent refueling station located on the Outer Rim planet Castilon—where Commander Poe Dameron instructed him to gather information pertaining to the local population's sympathies and determine if their allegiance was to the Republic or the First Order.
            In order to avoid detection while engaging in espionage, Xiono required an occupation that would serve as a cover for his spying activities. He therefore became a starship mechanic in Jarek Yeager's repair shop. Additionally, he supported Yeager's Team Fireball as a racer and stunt pilot. Before departing from Castilon, Dameron left his astromech droid BB-8 in Xiono's care, believing the droid could help Xiono realize his full potential as an asset for the Resistance.
            Although Xiono struggled to maintain his cover as a mechanic, an occupation in which he had no prior experience, he was able to impress the platform's community by competing against Torra Doza in his first race on the Colossus. Furthermore, he contributed to its defense during a pirate raid on the platform, helping the Ace Squadron to drive off Kragan Gorr and his gang.
            Born on the Core World Hosnian Prime[1] in 14 ABY,[2] Kazuda "Kaz" Xiono was the son of Senator Hamato Xiono, a wealthy politician who served in the Galactic Senate during the era when the galaxy was governed by the New Republic, years after the Galactic Civil War.[4] Xiono, who aspired to become a great pilot, was awarded a trophy made from aurodium after winning his first race. He would keep it among his personal effects for years, believing the trophy brought him good fortune as well as the fact that it reminded him of his homeworld.[6]
            With his father's support, Xiono was able to enroll in a military academy which, in turn, led to service in the New Republic Defense Fleet. By then, the rise of the First Order gave way to a tense political standoff between the Republic and the Galactic Empire's successor. By 34 ABY, Xiono was serving as a T-85 X-wing pilot in the New Republic Starfighter Corps.[4]
            When New Republic Command acquired critical information pertaining to the First Order's operations in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories, Xiono's squadron was tasked with delivering the intelligence to the Resistance. They were engaged by Major Elrik Vonreg, who sought to prevent the squadron from completing their mission. Unable to outmaneuver the First Order pilot, Xiono ordered his wingmates, Mia Gabon and Hugh Sion, to abandon the mission while he remained behind to await the arrival of their Resistance contact, Commander Poe Dameron. Together, Xiono and Dameron were able to drive off Vonreg's TIE.[4]
            Concerned by the First Order's growing influence, the Resistance sought to protect the Republic by gathering information relating to the hermetic state. Dameron therefore recruited Xiono into the organization.[4] Although he was a pilot at the time, the Resistance sought to utilize Xiono as a spy for a classified assignment on the Colossus—an independent refueling station located on the Outer Rim ocean planet Castilon.[4]
            Dameron, who served as Xiono's point of contact, instructed the young operative to gather as much information as he could on the station's views concerning the Republic and First Order, as well as to determine which side the population ultimately supported. Xiono's activities as a spy required him to maintain a low profile; therefore, he found work as a starship mechanic in a local repair shop owned by Jarek Yeager. Yeager knew that Xiono was a spy and although he wanted nothing to do with the latter's mission, he allowed Xiono to join Team Fireball. In return, Xiono used his flying skills to the team's benefit, earning extra credits as a racer and stunt pilot. During his time with the team, he flew the craft known as the Fireball.[4]
            In addition to introducing Xiono to Yeager, Dameron entrusted the Resistance's new agent with his astromech droid BB-8. Dameron, who was reminded of himself by Xiono, believed that Xiono had the potential to become an invaluable asset to the Resistance. As such, he left his droid behind on the Colossus, believing BB-8 would be useful to Xiono in the course of his secret mission.[4]
            One of Xiono's first contacts on the Colossus was Neeku Vozo, another member of Yeager's team. When Xiono expressed his ambition to be the best pilot in the galaxy, Vozo thought Xiono was, in fact, the most skilled flyer. As a result, gossip began to spread across the platform much to the dismay of Xiono, who had hoped to keep a low profile while spying on the First Order. At Aunt Z's Tavern, Vozo's assertion that Xiono was a great pilot was ultimately taken as a challenge, one that Xiono was initially hesitant to accept but could not forfeit without facing repercussions. However, he was permitted to choose the racer he would compete against, and his choice was Torra Doza—the youngest racer of the Ace Squadron.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kazuda_Xiono</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKazudaXiono</string></dict>
        <key>Yolo Ziff</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.700.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Yolo Ziff was a human male artist who flew for the Resistance during its conflict against the First Order. In 34 ABY, Ziff created propaganda for the Resistance, and he participated in the Battle of Starkiller Base, flying under the command of Black Leader Poe Dameron. During the battle, the Resistance pilots targeted Starkiller Base's thermal oscillator, a weak point in the superweapon. Although their weapons were not strong enough to cause any damage to the structure, Ziff spotted a hole in the oscillator, which had been created by Resistance members Han Solo and Chewbacca, who were on the planet's surface. With the new opening, Ziff and the other pilots renewed their attack on the oscillator, and Dameron destroyed the target, crippling the weapon.
            A human male, Yolo Ziff was a talented holographer, digital editor, illustrator, and starfighter pilot.[3] By 34 ABY,[4] Ziff joined the Starfighter Corps of the Resistance, a military group formed by Leia Organa to protect the New Republic from the First Order. During Ziff's service, Resistance pilots joked that if Black Leader Poe Dameron were to pose for a poster, recruitment numbers would increase. Drawing inspiration from the quip, Ziff created a faux propaganda poster titled Resistance, which pictured a gallant image of Dameron standing in a "clear sky full of promises," joined by the X-wing fighters under his command. Although the poster was intended as a prank, it ended up on the HoloNet, resulting in multiple new recruits.[3]
            Following his unintentional success, Ziff was commissioned by Organa to create a piece to help the New Republic understand the true intentions of the First Order. The subject of the poster was to be the attack on Tuanul, a village slaughter witnessed by Dameron. Ziff hastily illustrated The Massacre at Tuanul, depicting flametroopers in Tuanul, setting fire to the settlements of peaceful religious pilgrims. Ironically, by the time Ziff finished the piece, the First Order, using a secret superweapon called Starkiller Base, destroyed the New Republic capital of Hosnian Prime.[3]
            Immediately after the Hosnian Cataclysm, the First Order targeted D'Qar, the planet of the Resistance base. When the Resistance learned of the First Order's imminent attack, they formed a plan to disable Starkiller Base's thermal oscillator—a critical weak point—hoping to destroy the weapon. However, the planet was shielded, so Finn, a former First Order strormtrooper, volunteered to escort Han Solo and Chewbacca inside the base, where they could disable the shield.[1] In preparation for the assault, Ziff and the other Resistance pilots were told to expect at least 80 percent casualties.[5]
            Ziff, flying with Red Squadron and Blue Squadron, entered hyperspace under the leadership of Dameron. Once the ground team disabled the shield, Dameron was given authorization to begin the assault, and he relayed the command. Ziff acknowledged Dameron's signal, and the squadrons dropped out of lightspeed, following Dameron into the planet's atmosphere and switching the S-foils of their T-70 X-wing starfighters into attack position. Once the squadrons reached the oscillator, Dameron gave the order to fire, so Ziff and the other pilots launched proton torpedoes at the structure. Despite hitting their target, no damage was done, and squadrons of TIE/fo space superiority fighters engaged them. The dogfight pushed the battle into the planet's orbit, and the First Order starfighters overwhelmed the Resistance pilots.[1]
            On the surface of the planet, Solo and Chewbacca had seen an opportunity to assist the pilots, so they set explosives inside the structure of the oscillator. When the charges were detonated, a opening was created, which Ziff soon noticed. He informed Dameron of the change, and the commander gave an order to resume their attack on their target. As the pilots flew toward the oscillator, Dameron told the remaining pilots to cover him as he entered the structure via the opening created by Solo and Chewbacca. From inside, Dameron destroyed the building, and the Resistance pilots followed him away from the planet as the damage caused it to implode.[1]
            A human male, Ziff had blue eyes and light-colored skin.[1] Ziff was a gifted holographer, digital editor, and illustrator, so when he heard a joke about Dameron posing for a poster, Ziff pulled a prank on the commander by actualizing the piece.[3]
            As a pilot in the Resistance, Ziff flew a T-70 X-wing starfighter,[1] a starfighter model manufactured by Incom-FreiTek.[6] During the assault on Starkiller Base, Ziff wore a flight suit and a flight helmet with red and gray markings.[1] His astromech droid was M9-G8.[2]
            Yolo Ziff was created for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, the seventh installment of the episodic Star Wars saga,[1] which was released on December 18, 2015.[7] His helmet was designed by Abram's son Henry.[8] The film was written by Lawrence Kasdan, J.J. Abrams, and Michael Arndt, and Ziff was portrayed by actor Stefan Grube,[1] who also served as the editor for the film's first two trailers.[9] Following the film's release, Ziff appeared in LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens, a LEGO video game adaptation of the film.[10] However, Ziff is absent from the film's adult and junior novelizations, in which his role is filled by Poe Dameron.[11][12] Additionally, Ziff's role is taken by Temmin Wexley in The Force Awakens, Part VI, a comic book adaptation of the film's final scenes.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yolo_Ziff</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascYoloZiff</string></dict>

        <key>Zekk</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.704.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zekk was a street-smart, Force-sensitive Human male orphan from Ennth who befriended the Solo twins Jaina and Jacen. After a fall to the dark side of the Force in his teenage years, he trained to be a Jedi Knight. Zekk would later go on to participate in the offensives against the Yuuzhan Vong and Dark Nest. During the Dark Nest Crisis, he and Jaina became Joiners and formed a particularly strong mental connection with one another.
            As of 40 ABY, Zekk and Jaina were un-Joined but still shared some thoughts. Soon after that they became partners, though Jaina's family thought they were romantically involved. During the Second Galactic Civil War he and Jaina participated in the Battle of Tralus as part of the Hardpoint Squadron. Soon after, he participated in the Blockade of Corellia under the leadership of Jacen and Jaina. Zekk later joined forces with Jaina and Jagged Fel to hunt down the rogue Dark Jedi Alema Rar. Zekk mysteriously vanished from the Force during the war's final battle. Jaina, who never felt him die, insisted he was still alive somewhere. He was considered missing in action, only to emerge months later alive, well, and romantically involved with the Hapan Security officer Taryn Zel.
            Zekk spent the first nine years of his life on the planet Ennth, where his parents were colonists. When Ennth began to self-destruct, as it did every eight years, Zekk, a bright, promising child, was sent to one of the planet's crowded orbiting refugee stations for several months until Ennth was safe for habitation again. His parents, who intended to join him in orbit, stayed on the surface too long trying to retrieve the last of their possessions and were killed in a groundquake.[5]
            Zekk, not wanting to stay on Ennth any longer without a family, escaped the refugee station and stowed away on a supply ship. For a period of time Zekk jumped from one ship to another, seeking out a life for himself, until he met the old spacer Peckhum, who became his friend and took him in.[1]
            Peckhum and Zekk shared a mid-level apartment on Coruscant that had been abandoned during the Galactic Civil War. Zekk had a degree of freedom that most children didn't have, since Peckhum was often away running supplies in his beat-up freighter, the Lightning Rod, or working as a caretaker for one of the many Orbital Solar Energy Transfer Satellites that surrounded Coruscant.[1]
            Zekk would often leave the apartment to explore Coruscant's undercity, where he discovered that he had something of a talent for finding things that were valuable. This talent was hit-or-miss, though. On one occasion Zekk climbed down forty-two stories of an abandoned turbolift shaft to find that what seemed to be a glittering object was actually a piece of foil wrapping stuck to some ooze.[1]
            Zekk would give the valuable scraps of metal, trinkets, and lost objects that he found to Peckhum, who knew how to sell them and whom to sell them to in order to put food on the table. However, the things that Zekk found were collected faster than Peckhum could sell them and as a result, they accumulated inside their apartment.[1]
            Zekk's knowledge of Coruscant's undercity and his talent for finding things caught the eye of Norys, the leader of a gang known as the Lost Ones. Though Norys derided Zekk as a "trash collector," he wanted Zekk to be his right-hand man so that he could access Zekk's vast knowledge of the streets of Coruscant's undercity. Zekk refused the offer because he didn't want to be the accessory of a bully like Norys. Norys didn't react well to the rejection, and while he decided that he wouldn't care if Zekk was maimed or killed, he still kept the invitation to join the Lost Ones open.[1]
            Sometime around 18 ABY, Zekk met Jaina Solo and her brother Jacen. Though he was aware of—and somewhat resented—the fact that they were better off than himself, Zekk didn't allow that to keep him from becoming friends with the twins. Zekk and the twins, as well as their brother Anakin, had many adventures together. Eventually Jacen and Jaina left for Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, leaving Zekk behind on Coruscant.[6]
            The Solo twins would later return to Coruscant with their friends Tenel Ka and Lowbacca for a month-long vacation. On the first day that they were there, they joined Zekk for yet another adventure into the undercity of Coruscant, where they discovered an abandoned Imperial shuttle and helped Zekk "acquire" a hawk-bat egg. After that, Zekk invited them to a midday meal of stormtrooper rations at his apartment. Jaina eventually suggested that in return, she and Jacen should invite him to a diplomatic dinner that would be held a couple of days later.[1]
            Zekk accepted the invitation and had Peckhum help him select some new clothes that would help him fit in at the banquet. Before Peckhum left once again to attend to his duties as the caretaker of an OSETS, Zekk promised the old man that he would find a central multitasking unit that would be needed to make the broken-down station more fit for Human habitation. A day later, Zekk made his way to the Imperial Palace to attend the banquet.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zekk</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZekk</string></dict>

        <key>Tyber Zann</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.707.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tyber Zann was a Human male crime lord from Anaxes who rose to prominence after the Battle of Yavin during the Galactic Civil War and led his own faction, known as the Zann Consortium, a powerful crime syndicate. He would wage a personal war against the Galactic Empire as revenge for expelling him from the Imperial Academy.
            Tyber Zann was born on Anaxes in 34 BBY, and first worked in the family firm Zann Remanufacturing, which specialized in refitting outdated Old Republic and Imperial Military hardware for civilian use. He became bored with the linear business, and started running illicit sabacc games and book-making, which he found to provide the excitement and revenue that he sought.[1]
            In order to arm his gambling ring's enforcers, Zann attempted to steal an arms shipment from one the company's warehouses. The security forces caught him and reported the attempted theft to his father, who as punishment, arranged for him to be enrolled as a cadet in the Imperial Academy of Carida.[1]
            Operating out of the Academy, Zann established a new smuggling ring - the Zann Consortium. The facility's lax security made it simple for him to steal Imperial weaponry and smuggle it off-world, to his partner Urai Fen, who sold them on the black market. A top performer, Zann used the credentials this granted him to get on training missions where he could form a network of contacts for the smuggling trade. The operation became one of the largest in the galaxy, and he started to evoke the attention of more powerful criminals, namely Jabba the Hutt. Jabba coordinated a plan to catch Zann during a smuggling run shortly before his graduation. Fortunately for Tyber, Urai intercepted transmissions between Imperial authorities about the plot. Although he was able to avoid any prosecution, Zann was forced to leave the Academy in contempt.[1]
            Despite his misgivings, Zann perceived that to continue building the Zann Consortium he would need to forge an alliance with Jabba. Subsequently he began running smuggling operations for the Hutt in exchange for vehicles and vessels, while also concealing assets from the fellow Crime Lord.[1] Zann never intended this arrangement to be permanent, and after a year he had gained word that Jabba had spent nearly half his wealth on a unique artifact, though Tyber did not know anything of its origins.[2]
            The Zann Consortium was still small, and Zann intended to establish communications with a black market on Nal Hutta, though first he needed to show them an example of his capabilities, and develop a reputation that the Consortium was a force-to-be-reckoned with. After being informed by one of his soldiers that the Mandalorian Supreme Strategist was traveling to the Hutt space station above Mandalore, Zann seized the opportunity. Traveling to Mandalore, the Consortium flotilla destroyed the V-wing escort sent to prepare for the strategist's arrival. Shortly afterwards, the strategist arrived, though the Consortium ambushed him. During the battle, the strategist's engines were destroyed, his ship was boarded, and he was taken prisoner. Zann assigned one of his defilers to establish communications with the black market, and Urai was sent to buy disruptor technology for the Consortium's mercenaries.[2]
            Zann's agents decoded a message from an Imperial outpost on Felucia that authorized Jabba to land on the planet's surface. Recognizing that the Hutt intended to sell the artifact to the Empire, Zann lead a taskforce along with Urai and several squads of mercenaries to steal the artifact before the transaction could be made. Posing as Hutt Cartel forces, the Imperial fleet commander was convinced, though hesitantly, that the group were arriving separately from the main group to safeguard the artifact. The taskforce, aboard a TZ-86 transport located a clearing in the dense foliage and landed there. Ordering Alpha Squad to scout ahead and make sure that their path to the Hutt landing site was clear, Zann watched as they perished to Felucian spore plants. Fortunately for the remainder, they had brought a repulsorlift F9-TZ Transport, which Zann ordered his troops to unload, and to deploy a Mobile Defense Unit with a rocket pod, lest somebody stumble across the landing site. The group proceeded to ride the transport as far as they could, but thick vegetation obstructed their path, so they had to traverse the rest by foot. The taskforce came into conflict with Cartel forces along the way, although they failed to avert the Consortium's advance. Leaving the troops behind, Zann and Urai utilized their personal cloaking devices to bypass the anti-infantry turrets and reach where the artifact was being held. Urai uncloaked and killed the Hutt mercenaries guarding the artifact, and Zann ordered him to take the relic and meet him at the rendezvous point. Just after the cloaked Urai left, Tyber was apprehended by Stormtroopers, which Zann defeated, though many more Imperial forces arrived immediately afterwards. Outnumbered, Zann let them take him into custody, but vowed that they wouldn't hold him for long.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tyber_Zann</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTyberZann</string></dict>

            That year, the Alliance destroyed the Empire's DS-1 Orbital Battle Station superweapon over the moon Yavin 4. Following the battle, a ceremony was held in the Grand Audience Chamber of the Great Temple, the Alliance's base on Yavin 4.

        <key>Giles Durane</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.709.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Giles Durane, also known as the "Weapons Master," was a Human male veteran who was a friend of Bail Prestor Organa, whom he served with during the Clone Wars. Durane's family was killed when his homeworld was hit with a plague; left poor and cynical, Durane became a mercenary. Years later, Durane agreed to train Organa's daughter, Leia, in the use of weaponry.
            During the Clone Wars, Giles Durane was a good-hearted idealist. He served with Bail Organa, who saved his life on more than one occasion.[2] Accompanying the senator on a mission to Virgillia 7 during the first week of the war, Durane teamed with Jedi Master Ashka Boda to rescue Jedi Padawan Halagad Ventor and his master, Everen Ettene, from the conflict on the ground. While Ettene did not return from that mission, Durane and Boda successfully extracted Jedi Ventor.[3] Durane even trained Organa's bodyguard, Sateen Vestswe.[4] When the galactic conflict came to an end, Durane was left so poor that when a plague swept his homeworld, he had no money to transport his family off-planet. By the time he made contact with his friend Bail Organa, it was too late. At that point, Durane vowed to himself that he would never be poor or in anyone else's debt again.[2]
            Many years later, Organa hired Durane to teach his daughter, Leia, who was serving her first term as an Imperial senator, how to use weapons to be able to defend herself. Though there was little money in it for Durane, he agreed because he owed it to his friend Organa. When Leia arrived on the planet Challon, she met Giles and his partner, Gimlet, and the pair soon saved Leia from an assassination attempt. As Durane explained to her why he was hired, Leia was initially somewhat reluctant, being from the pacifist world of Alderaan. Yet her life was obviously in danger, and as Durane told her, "not all matters can be settled by senatorial debate."[2] During his service to the senator, Durane was given the title of Royal Weapons Master.[5]
            Durane took Leia aboard his ship and trained her for a variety of weapons, from a handheld blaster to a ship's laser cannons. After a period of time, Durane spoke with Bail, and both felt that Leia was skilled enough to defend herself, even though Giles thought she could use a bit more "speed and accuracy." As Leia continued with her senatorial business on Challon, General Emir, the man behind the failed assassination attempts on Leia's life, realized that he had hired the wrong assassins; the man who had been killing his assassins was the only man who could kill the senator. With this in mind, he hired Durane to kill Torgas, the head of the Assassins Guild, and to finish his job by killing the senator.[2]
            Though Durane warned Gimlet not to alert Leia, his partner tried anyway. However, Torgas arrived first and killed Gimlet just as he approached Leia. Because of this, when Durane showed up to kill Torgas, Leia thought that she was safe—but then Durane told her of his new job. His debt to Bail Organa was paid off, and now he was pure mercenary; he was going to carry out his job, no matter what. However, when Durane fired his blaster at Leia, she spun out of the way and fired back, delivering a fatal blast with the speed and accuracy she had never achieved before. Durane dropped his blaster and fell to the ground. With his dying breath, Durane told Leia that he always knew that someday, in the right circumstances, she'd get it perfect.[2]
            Giles Durane was a jovial man. An idealist during the Clone Wars, Durane became more of a cynic after a plague hit his homeworld, killing his family and leaving him poor. Durane vowed to become self-reliant and be indebted to no one. As a mercenary, Durane was incorruptible, always putting his job first.[2]
            Still owing Bail Organa for saving his life decades prior, Durane agreed to train Leia Organa to defend herself with weaponry. The skills he taught her served her well—after his debt was paid off, the mercenary Durane took on a job to kill Leia, only to be killed by her own quick blast. He died a man proud of the skilled young woman he had trained.[2]
            True to his name, the Weapons Master carried a veritable arsenal of diverse weaponry. The most obvious of these were two light blasters, one at his right hip, the other in a cross-draw rig under his left arm. As well, Durane wore an unobtrusive, wrist-mounted dart launcher on his right wrist capable of firing explosive or poison-tipped darts silently with a wave of his hand. Along the left sleeve of his nondescript hooded jumpsuit was a row of small throwing discs, which Durane could wield with equally deadly accuracy. In a boot sheath Durane kept an imposingly large throwing dagger that he could draw with blinding speed thanks to a magnetic attractor hidden in his gauntlet.[2]
            The Weapons Master also carried a multipurpose scanner that could detect the presence of hidden explosives as well as monitoring the remote systems aboard his private ship.[2]
            Giles Durane was created by writer Archie Goodwin and artists Carmine Infantino and Steve Mitchell for the story The Weapons Master!, which was published in Marvel UK's Star Wars Weekly 104–106 and later reprinted in Marvel Illustrated Books' Star Wars. Durane also appears in the comic story "The Princess Leia Diaries" in Star Wars Tales 11, but instead of being a huge man as portrayed in The Weapons Master!, he is a much smaller man with darker skin.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Giles_Durane</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGilesDurane</string></dict>
        <key>Kyp Durron</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.710.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kyp Durron was a Human male who was a polarizing figure in galactic history, both a leading Jedi Master in Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order and a man responsible for many deaths during his anti-Imperial rampage in 11 ABY. Incarcerated in the spice mines of Kessel by the Galactic Empire at an early age, Durron's deep anger against his imprisoners was easily exploited by the spirit of Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun, once Han Solo rescued the young Force-sensitive and took him to Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. Under Kun's guidance, Durron stole the Sun Crusher superweapon and embarked upon a vendetta, destroying several Imperial targets and unwittingly killing his own brother in the process. Only after Kun's influence had been banished did Durron begin a long quest for absolution which led him to become Skywalker’s most talented pupil and one of the first Jedi Masters of the New Jedi Order.
            Despite Durron's reformation, his desire to repent for his actions manifested itself in a high-profile campaign against smugglers in the Outer Rim Territories as part of a philosophy of direct action against those whom he perceived as wrong-doers. When the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong attacked the galaxy in 25 ABY, Durron was one of the first to meet the threat, losing his apprentice and many other fellow Jedi in the opening months of the war. His policy of aggressive action was enhanced in the face of the Yuuzhan Vong menace and Durron began leading like-minded Jedi to war, against the wishes of Skywalker. Following further losses, Durron briefly took Jaina Solo as his apprentice and was later reconciled with Skywalker following Galactic Alliance Chief of State Cal Omas' creation of the High Council, upon which both men had seats. Durron saw the war through to its conclusion and remained one of Skywalker's leading advisors on the newly formed Jedi High Council.
            In 35 ABY, when a border conflict between the Chiss Ascendancy and the insectoid Killik species flared out of control, a group of younger Jedi departed to fight on behalf of the Killiks, provoking Chief of State Omas to attempt to gain more control over the Jedi Order. Durron, as the proponent of the philosophy that Jedi should follow the guidance of the Force rather than the policies of the reigning government, stridently opposed Omas, upholding his principles throughout the course of the conflict. The Jedi Master later found himself fighting the Galactic Alliance directly during the Second Galactic Civil War, when Jaina Solo’s twin brother Jacen Solo took control of the government and attempted to impose Sith rule upon the galaxy as Darth Caedus. Following Jacen Solo’s defeat, the galaxy entered into a period of reformation under the direction of Chief of State Natasi Daala, one of Durron’s former Imperial enemies. Daala’s policies included attempts to curb the autonomy of the Jedi Order, which Durron weathered alongside the emerging threat of a mysterious Force psychosis.
            Kyp Durron, a Force-sensitive Human male, was born in 7 BBY on the planet Deyer, a colony world in the Anoat system.[6][9] Durron, who was an active child during his childhood, had an older brother, Zeth, with whom he had a close relationship. As small boys, Kyp and his brother used to fish, swim and play in the lakes that covered the planet's surface.[12] Zeth, who was an intelligent youth, had dreams of attending Deyer's civil engineering school to help out in the running of the colony.[13] Kyp, however, was six years younger than his brother and was content with his simple life on the waterworld.[6]
            The Durron family lived in one of Deyer's many raft cities, which floated upon the lakes as the inhabitants fished and sold their produce through a cooperative system which brought the backwater colony a decent profit.[13] While Durron's parents were not, as far as the young man knew, Force-sensitives themselves, they were political opponents of the Galactic Empire,[6] the authoritarian government that had come to power in 19 BBY following the dissolution of the Galactic Republic.[14] Durron's parents believed that Emperor Palpatine could be convinced that moderate action was preferable to oppressive governance and protested during the anniversary of the Ghorman Massacre.[15] The Deyer colonists in general, however, even though they had modeled the charter of the fishing cooperative on the ideals of the obsolete Galactic Republic, were largely ignored by Emperor Palpatine while they experimented with civil liberties, due to the planet's backwater status.[13]
            Following events in 0 ABY, however, the political activism of the Deyer colonists could no longer be tolerated.[13] The Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon was used to destroy the planet Alderaan, a world known for its pacifism,[16] an action that provoked outrage across the galaxy.[17] Many of the colonists, among them Durron's parents, spoke out against the Galactic Empire's actions, believing that democracy and peaceful protest could effect change.[6] Deyer's representatives denounced Alderaan's destruction and requested that Palpatine dismantle his New Order. The emperor's response came in the form of repression. In 1 ABY, Imperial stormtroopers moved in on the colonies, putting an end to the co-operative and its liberal propensities. Deyer's raft cities were rapidly overwhelmed, its capital city of Feiya conquered and its population rounded up for imprisonment.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kyp_Durron</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKypDurron</string></dict>
        <key>Kes Dameron</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.711.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kes Dameron was a human male soldier who served as a sergeant in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. He was married to Shara Bey, a Rebel pilot. They both fought against the Galactic Empire in the Battle of Endor, during which Dameron was part of the Pathfinders, a special forces strike team led by General Han Solo that destroyed the Death Star II's deflector shield generator. After the Empire's defeat during the battle, both Dameron and Bey participated in an assault on an outpost manned by Imperial holdouts on Endor.
            Dameron fought with the Pathfinders for the next several weeks, including the raid at the Wretch of Tayron. After fighting their way into an Imperial Security Bureau black site, the team was able to gain data needed to uncover and stop Operation: Cinder, an Imperial operation designed to destroy numerous worlds to avenge the death of the Emperor, Darth Sidious, who had been killed during the Battle of Endor. Three months after the raid, Dameron and Bey both left Rebel service and began a new life together. At their new home on Yavin 4, they planted a fragment of a Force-sensitive tree, one that had once dwelled at the heart of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, after it had been gifted to Bey by Commander Luke Skywalker.
            Sergeant Kes Dameron was a soldier in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during its fight against the Galactic Empire in the Galactic Civil War. He was married to Rebel pilot Shara Bey, with whom he served in the Rebel Alliance,[1] and together they had a son, Poe.[2] Because of their service in the Rebellion, Dameron and Bey only saw each other for short periods of time, often for hour-long intervals after several weeks apart.[3]
            During the Battle of Endor, Dameron fought as part of a special-forces group known as the Pathfinders under the command of General Han Solo. The group's objective was to destroy the generator powering the shield for the orbiting Death Star II, which would allow the Alliance Fleet to destroy the battle station. The plan was successful; the Death Star was destroyed, the Emperor, Darth Sidious, was killed, and the Empire was dealt a crippling blow before retreating from Endor. Dameron and the surviving Pathfinders returned to Bright Tree Village, the home of the native Ewoks who helped them win the battle, where they and others in the Rebellion celebrated their victory over the Empire. Many of the Alliance pilots and other personnel also ferried down to the village, including Bey, who flew with Green Squadron during the battle to destroy the Death Star. They were relieved to find one another safe and sound, and they took a walk through the village to talk about their future and what they would do with the war coming to an end. They then spent the night together.[1]
            The next morning, Solo reassembled the Pathfinders and informed them that a group of Imperials was still holding out in an outpost on the far side of Endor. Solo intended to attack the base, not wanting to leave a group of Imperials on Endor after the Ewoks helped the Alliance in the battle. Dameron and the rest of the Pathfinders would assault the outpost, while Bey volunteered to pilot the gunship that would transport the soldiers to the base. The gunship soon arrived and assaulted the outpost, and the Pathfinders deployed into the area. As he disembarked from the gunship, Dameron told Bey that he was ready to settle down on another planet and build a house. Dameron and the Pathfinders fought their way into the base, where they found Imperial intelligence suggesting that the Empire still had plans for the galaxy, before returning to the ship.[1] Dameron and Bey were soon sent on separate assignments, with Dameron continuing to serve alongside General Solo. His duties necessitated a communications blackout, so he was unable to speak with Bey for several weeks.[2]
            Twenty days after the Battle of Endor, Dameron fought with the Pathfinders in a raid on the Wretch of Tayron, the location of an Imperial Security Bureau black site in the Outer Rim Territories. He and Sakas, a fellow Pathfinder, performed reconnaissance before the raid began, while other members of the strike team set up charges to infiltrate the secret base. Dameron and other Pathfinders fired several shots at the base, taking out All Terrain Scout Transports and other heavy equipment. The Pathfinders moved in, with Dameron having cleared a hole, and began fighting the stormtroopers stationed outside the base. Dameron was nearly shot by a scout trooper, but he was saved by Chewbacca, General Solo's Wookiee companion, who attacked the trooper before he could kill Dameron. Solo soon arrived and reviewed the plan of attack, at which point they entered the base.[4]
            The Pathfinders fought their way through the base and captured its commander before he could purge the data from the ISB computer banks. The commander surrendered, and the Rebels, using the protocol droid C-3PO, hacked into the computers. Once inside the computers, Threepio discovered that an Imperial operation known as Operation: Cinder was underway, including on Naboo—where Bey was located, as she was serving as the personal pilot of Princess Leia Organa. With Naboo under heavy, world-ending siege to enact the Emperor's final wrath, a Rebel fleet under the command of General Lando Calrissian made their way to Naboo. They were able to rescue Bey and Organa, who, along with Queen Sosha Soruna, flew a mission to destroy the Imperial satellites being used in an attempt to destroy Naboo. The Rebels stopped the Empire from destroying Naboo, and Dameron reunited with Bey on the Rebel fleet.[4] For his actions during the raid at the Wretch of Tayron, as well as the assault on the Imperial base on Endor, General Solo remarked in a letter to General Madine that Dameron had performed several acts of valor.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kes_Dameron</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKesDameron</string></dict>

Dallow served as the pilot of the Resistance bomber Cobalt Hammer during the Atterra campaign[4] and later the evacuation of D'Qar. During the evacuation, Dallow and the other pilots of the Resistance navy's bombing squadron flew their bombers toward a Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought, the Fulminatrix. After the other bombers were destroyed, the only chance the Resistance had was the Hammer. Despite numerous attacks by enemy fighters, Dallow managed to get the bomber into optimum position over the Fulminatrix before the cockpit was destroyed by a TIE fighter, killing him. Another crewmember, Paige Tico, managed to drop the bomber's payload, ultimately destroying the Fulminatrix, but killing her in the process when the crippled Hammer dropped into the flames. Cobalt Squadron's sacrifice meant the destruction of the Fulminatrix, allowing the Resistance to escape D'Qar.[3]
            Finch Dallow was played by Kevin Layne in the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi where he was credited as "Resistance Bomber pilot #1".[3] Dallow's role as the pilot of the Cobalt Hammer was originally supposed to be filled by Finn in an early draft of the film's script, but director Rian Johnson scrapped the idea because if Finn wasn't aware that Paige Tico was Rose Tico's sister, later there would have been a big "I saw your sister die" scene which Johnson didn't want to write, making Finn, in Johnson's words, an "asshole."[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Finch_Dallow</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFinchDallow</string></dict>
        <key>Poe Dameron</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.713.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Poe Dameron was a human male who served as a pilot in the New Republic and, later, the Resistance during its conflict and subsequent war with the First Order. The son of Lieutenant Shara Bey and Sergeant Kes Dameron of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Dameron followed in his late mother's footsteps in becoming a pilot, serving the New Republic Defense Fleet as the commander of Rapier Squadron, but grew disillusioned with the Republic's inaction to the First Order's violations of the Galactic Concordance. Dameron defected to the Resistance, where he became one of General Leia Organa's most trusted operatives. Dameron flew under the callsign of Black Leader while piloting his specialized T-70 X-wing starfighter, Black One.
            As the conflict with the First Order grew more desperate, Dameron was sent to find Lor San Tekka on Jakku, who had part of a map to locate Organa's brother, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Though Dameron entrusted the map to his astromech droid BB-8, he was captured by the First Order and interrogated for the location of the map, eventually being forced to hand over the information. He escaped with the help of a defecting stormtrooper, whom Dameron nicknamed Finn, and returned to the Resistance base on D'Qar on his own. He aided Finn, Rey, Han Solo, and Chewbacca with air support during the Battle of Takodana, and he later flew during the battle to destroy the superweapon known as Starkiller Base. During the battle, after the base was damaged by Solo, Finn, Rey, and Chewbacca, Dameron fired the shots that destroyed the Starkiller weapon, saving the Resistance from certain destruction.
            During the subsequent evacuation of D'Qar, Dameron disobeyed orders and led an attack on the First Order Dreadnought Fulminatrix, but his reckless actions caused him to be demoted from Wing Commander to captain. As the First Order pursued the Resistance by tracking them through hyperspace to the Crait system, Dameron did not approve of the passive strategy of Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo and worked with Finn and mechanic Rose Tico to break into Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship, the Supremacy, and disable the First Order's hyperspace tracker before eventually staging a mutiny against Admiral Holdo in an effort to buy Finn and Rose time.
            However, Dameron and the mutineers had not realized that Holdo's plan was to discreetly transport the Resistance to an abandoned Rebel base on the nearby planet Crait, and his group's actions caused the First Order to discover the Resistance's escape vessels and destroy many of them. Even so, General Organa gave Dameron command after Holdo sacrificed herself, and he led a last-ditch counterattack against the First Order during the Battle of Crait. The counterattack was unsuccessful, but Dameron was able to lead the surviving Resistance fighters while a Force projection of Luke Skywalker distracted Kylo Ren and the First Order, where they found their way to Rey and the Millennium Falcon, allowing them to escape.
            After the escape, the group took the brief moment of peace to catch up on recent events, and as he left for the Battle of Grail City, the ace was promoted back to commander. After that, he reflected on what it truly meant to be a member of the Resistance, and how he believed it was about bringing light to dark and saving one's galaxy.
            Three years prior to his birth, Poe Dameron's voice was heard by Padawan Ezra Bridger during his mission to a place that existed between time and space.[9] Born two years before the Battle of Endor,[2] Poe Dameron was the son of Shara Bey and Kes Dameron, who both served the Alliance to Restore the Republic in the fight against the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.[10] As an infant, Dameron rarely saw his parents due to the Alliance's continued operations against the Imperials before and after Endor,[1] as his mother worked as a Rebel pilot for the Alliance's Green Squadron and his father was a member of the Pathfinders,[11] and Dameron was thus left in the care of his maternal grandfather.[10] Six months after the Battle of Endor,[5] after the Imperial remnant put forward Operation: Cinder, Dameron's parents left Rebel service to reunite with him, settle on Yavin 4 and build a house—close to which they planted a Force-sensitive tree, a gift from Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker.[1]
            At age 6,[2] Dameron began to learn how to fly in his mother's old RZ-1 A-wing interceptor, which was part of his mother's compensation package when she mustered out of the Rebellion. She would take Dameron up in it, and he would sit in her lap, learning how to control the ship from her. Tragedy struck his family when his mother unexpectedly died; at the time, Dameron was only eight years old.[5] L'ulo L'ampar, Bey's fellow Rebel pilot and friend, helped raise Dameron, and was thus like family to him.[12]
            Eventually, Dameron became a pilot himself and joined the New Republic Defense Fleet. Upon entering the New Republic's service, he began to learn the true scope of his mother's heroism, and he himself rose through the ranks, becoming a commander for the New Republic,[5] and earned the reputation of being extremely skilled.[13] Given command of Rapier Squadron, a group of T-85 X-wings, Dameron also met the spherical astromech droid BB-8, who would go onto assist him during his flights as Rapier Leader and become a steadfast friend from then on.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Poe_Dameron</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPoeDameron</string></dict>

            During Dreed's mission, an Alderaanian member of his crew named Tula was contacted by her sister, Tace, who informed her that the Alderaanian Princess Leia Organa was on a mission to rescue the surviving Alderaanians from Imperial persecution. Tace was unaware of Tula's Imperial loyalty, and so Dreed used her as a source of information on Organa, with Tula contacting Tace every night for updates on the princess's location and plans.[5] Through the sisters, he learned that Organa was planning on traveling to the planet Sullust to make contact with an Alderaan Enclave built there.[3]
            Organa made planetfall on Sullust and reached the enclave, but as she tried to persuade its inhabitants to join with her, they discovered the communication between Tace and Tula and accused Organa of working with the Imperials. As Organa and her pilot companion, Evaan Verlaine, were forced to flee from their kinsmen, Dreed dispatched a Sentinel-class landing craft carrying a platoon of stormtroopers to attack the enclave. The troopers dropped down on the underground enclave from its ceiling but were defeated when Organa and Verlaine led a herd of rockrenders back into the enclave to fight them. When Dreed learned that his men were dead, he decided to let the Alderaanians escape to lead him to another world, instead of deploying more troops.[3]
            However, Organa and her allies were now aware of Tula's deception, and the next time she contacted Tace via video transmission, Dreed realized that the charade was up. He ordered Tula to be taken away and processed for detention, as she was no longer of use to him. In order to try and save Tace's sister, Organa pleaded with him for an exchange. The commander demanded that the princess hand over herself, to which Organa agreed, arranging an exchange on the desert world of Skaradosh. Dreed traveled from his Star Destroyer to the planet's surface in a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, arriving shortly before the Alderaanian party's T-1 shuttle.[6]
            The prisoners were peacefully exchanged,[6] but before Organa could be loaded onto the Imperial shuttle, the starship Mellcrawler swooped down and opened fire on the Imperials. The Sullustan smuggler Nien Nunb, who was aiding the Alliance as a friend of Verlaine, had sneaked the ship into the planet's atmosphere. To protect himself, Dreed grabbed Organa to use as a shield, but she escaped by stamping on his foot. With a clear shot, Verlaine opened fire from aboard the starship and killed Dreed. The rebels then launched a decoy vessel from Skaradosh's surface, which Dreed's Star Destroyer crew,[2] now under the command of Captain Venk,[7] destroyed, assuming it carried their foes. Believing they had killed Organa, the Star Destroyer's crew then traveled to the planet Espirion, where Organa and her assembled Alderaanian survivors joined forces to destroy the Imperial ship.[2]
            As an Imperial officer tasked with hunting down the survivors of Alderaan's destruction, Dreed held some respect for Leia Organa. He believed that she could possibly teach the Empire a thing or two about combat after she defeated his men on Sullust,[3] but he repeatedly disregarded her sentiment that all Alderaanians were worth saving.[6]
            He was impressed with how quickly Tula, his Alderaanian crewman, could so easily betray her sister but was nevertheless fully prepared for her to betray him at some point.[3] Once he realized that the surviving Alderaanians had seen through his ploy, Dreed ordered for Tula to be taken away to detention, no longer having any use for her. During the prisoner exchange, Dreed kept his Star Destroyer in Skaradosh's orbit to make sure that the Alderaanians did not betray him, claiming to be more willing to honor his agreement and let the others go free if he got Organa.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dreed</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDreed</string></dict>
        <key>Drokko Kira</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.716.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Drokko Kira was a Human male, the father of Beast-Lord Modon Kira, grandfather of Oron Kira, and a native of the capital city Iziz on Onderon. Around 4050 BBY, Kira challenged the legacy of the Dark Lord of the Sith Freedon Nadd, who had crowned himself King of Onderon centuries before and taught his descendants the dark side of the Force. For this, Kira was banished from Iziz, sustaining an unhealing wound in the process. Kira did not speak again for fifty years but eventually joined the Beast Riders, a group of criminals cast out of Iziz who waged a war on the capital. In 4000 BBY, Kira attended the binding ceremony of his grandson, Oron, and Princess Galia, heiress to the Onderonian throne. The ceremony was interrupted by three Jedi—brothers Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, and the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta—whom Modon enlisted to fight the dark side reign in Iziz. Although Ulic Qel-Droma wanted to lead a peace mission, Drokko Kira, speaking for the first time in years, asked him if he would fight alongside the Beast Riders if the mission failed; Qel-Droma agreed. The peace talks indeed proved unsuccessful and the Beast Riders were victorious in the ensuing showdown in Iziz.
            Drokko Kira was a Human male native of Onderon in the years leading up to the Great Sith War. Kira was a native of the walled capital city of Iziz and lived during a period when the city's royal family was constantly warring with outcast Beast Riders who dwelt beyond Iziz's walls. In 4400 BBY, a fallen Jedi Knight–turned–Sith Lord named Freedon Nadd came to Onderon and subjugated the world, crowning himself king and eventually teaching his descendants the dark side of the Force. Around 4050 BBY, Kira challenged the legacy of Nadd. For this, he was branded as a criminal and cast out of Iziz. Kira suffered an unhealing wound during this time and did not speak again for fifty years. Kira soon joined the Beast Riders and eventually had a son, Modon Kira, who became a respected and powerful Beast-Lord. Modon, in turn, had a son, named Oron Kira. Oron eventually fell in love with Princess Galia, heiress to the Onderonian throne. Galia returned his affections and, in 4000 BBY, she came to Fortress Kira to marry him.[1]
            Drokko Kira, along with Modon, attended the Binding Ceremony of Oron Kira and Galia. However, the festivities were interrupted by the arrival of three Jedi Knights—brothers Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, and the Twi'lek Tott Doneeta—who had been sent by Onderonian Queen Amanoa to retrieve Galia. They unhanded Galia when she informed them that she was there willingly and that they were welcomed to the banquet by Modon. Oron told the Jedi about the dark side leanings of the Onderonian monarchy, and Modon asked them to join the fight against them. Ulic Qel-Droma preferred to resolve the conflict peacefully and proposed a mission to do just that. Suddenly, Drokko Kira emerged from his stupor and spoke for the first time in decades, asking Qel-Droma if he would join the fight against the dark side should the peace mission fail, and Qel-Droma agreed. The peace mission was a failure, and Modon's Beast Rider army defeated Queen Amanoa's forces in the deciding Battle of Iziz, ending the reign of the dark side on Onderon.[1]
            In his younger years, Drokko Kira was considerably bolder, openly challenging the legacy of Freedon Nadd that gripped Onderon. However, after his banishment, Kira became locked in a stupor, not speaking a word for fifty years. Yet, when talk of bringing down the dark side–worshiping monarchy in Iziz once again surrounded him, Kira perked up and spoke for the first time since his banishment.[1]
            Drokko Kira first appeared in Tales of the Jedi: Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon, the first story arc of the Tales of the Jedi comic book series, written by Tom Veitch and released in 1993. Kira appears in the second and final issue of the arc, playing a relatively minor role. In this appearance he is illustrated by Christian Gossett.[1] The Star Wars Insider 26 article Straight from the Horse's Mouth: A Guide to the Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi Universe, Part 1 says that Kira was cast out of Iziz at 4048 BBY,[2] while the Tales of the Jedi comic places his exile at 4,050 BBY.[1] As Insider 26 contradicts many other established dates,[2] this article treats the comic as being correct.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Drokko_Kira</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDrokkoKira</string></dict>
        <key>Garven Dreis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.717.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Garven "Dave" Dreis was the commander of Red Squadron, and a T-65 X-wing starfighter pilot for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Hailing from the planet Virujansi in the Inner Rim, Dreis originally served with the Rarefied Air Cavalry, fighting in the Clone Wars that took place from 22 BBY to 19 BBY. During the Battle of Virujansi, Dreis had the opportunity to fly alongside the "Hero With No Fear," Anakin Skywalker. In the wake of the Clone Wars and the subsequent Declaration of a New Order, Dreis joined the Rebel Alliance—an organization dedicated to shaking the Galactic Empire's hold on the galaxy—after seeing the Empire commit atrocities on his homeworld.
            Dreis served the Alliance in numerous battles, adopting a fatherly approach to commanding his men, and supervised the instruction of new recruits personally. In 0 BBY, he was posted at the Alliance's base on Dantooine, leading Dantooine Squadron, and was transferred to Yavin 4's Great Temple shortly afterward. Placed in command of Red Squadron, Dreis took the call sign "Red Leader," and the nickname "Boss." From there, he led Red Squadron in an attack on the Empire's Death Star superweapon, which was moving to destroy the Alliance base. When an attack run on the battlestation's vulnerable thermal exhaust port from pilot Jon Vander's Gold Squadron failed, Dreis was forced to make his own attempt. He almost succeeded, but his proton torpedoes failed to enter the Death Star's exhaust port. Dreis was subsequently shot down by the Sith Lord Darth Vader.
            Garven Dreis, a Human male, was born on the planet Virujansi[1] in the Inner Rim.[4] Growing up on the family farm, Dreis spent much of his youth flying in the giant borecrawler caves, and knew every inch of the area.[1] During the pan-galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars, which broke out in 22 BBY and raged for three years,[5] Dreis served with his homeworld's Rarefied Air Cavalry.[3] When Virujansi was occupied by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Rarefied Air Cavalry fought alongside the Republic Navy to liberate the planet. Much of the air-based combat was fought in the borecrawler caves,[6] where Dreis[3]—who had only just graduated from flying T-16 skyhoppers to Z-95 Headhunters[1]—was given the opportunity to fly alongside the heralded "Hero With No Fear," Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who was leading the Republic air forces in the battle.[3] Dreis was considered to be the hottest pilot on Virujansi despite his youth, until Skywalker arrived. On Skywalker's first trip through the borecrawler caves, Dreis had flown in the lead position, and wondered if the Jedi would be able to keep up. After two minutes, Dreis' musings were answered when Skywalker snap-rolled his Delta-7 and took over the lead. Dreis struggled to keep up, and his astonishment at Skywalker's feat was acknowledged back at base by a smile from the Jedi.[1] Thanks to the efforts of the Rarefied Air Cavalry and the Republic, Virujansi was successfully liberated.[6] In his later life, Dreis would hold Skywalker in great esteem.[7]
            With the rise of the Galactic Empire following the end of the Clone Wars, Dreis remained on Virujansi and was witness to several Imperial atrocities. His village was burned, and the fields of his family's farm were torched by the Empire. He watched TIE fighters destroy transports with only the bare minimum of reasons. Eventually, Dreis decided to take a stand against the Empire and joined the Alliance, serving as starfighter pilot. He served in numerous campaigns flying X-wings, Y-wings, and R-22s. At some point, he gained the nickname "Dave".[1]
            In his work, Dreis participated in the recruitment of new pilots for squadrons other than his own, such as Ryle Torsyn of Gold Squadron.[8] For a considerable amount of time, Ord Mantellian smuggler Theron Nett flew as Dreis's wingman.[9] In addition to his use of the T-65, Dreis amassed over a thousand hours of experience in the T-16 skyhopper, which featured similar controls to the X-wing.[7] In 0 BBY, he was assigned to the Alliance base on the world of Dantooine,[10] where he commanded Dantooine Squadron.[1] On Dantooine, Dreis was joined by an old comrade, Davish Krail of Gold Squadron.[7] The Rebels were forced to abandon that base, however, when Torsyn discovered a hidden Imperial tracking device,[8] and as a result, they relocated to the Great Temple on Yavin 4.[2]
            On Yavin 4, Red Squadron was hastily assembled from pilots from Dantooine Squadron, the Tierfon Yellow Aces, and the Griffon Flight Wing.[1] Dreis was assigned to command the new squadron,[11] flying the lead X-wing starfighter under the call sign of "Red 1"[10] or "Red Leader."[2] Most of the pilots in his squadron had been trained by the experienced Dreis,[12] who, along with his pilots, was tasked with the protection of Alliance High Command. When commanding Red Squadron—or as he referred to them, "Red Boys"—he adopted an almost fatherly approach, and was well-respected for it.[13] He also earned the nicknames "Boss" and "Chief" from his squadron,[14] but to the younger pilots he was only ever known as "Red Leader."[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Garven_Dreis/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGarvenDreis</string></dict>
        <key>Remulus Dreypa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.718.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Remulus Dreypa was a male Baron and Jedi Admiral who fell to the dark side during the Hundred-Year Darkness. Following the Battle of Corbos which ended that conflict in 6900 BBY, he and several other Dark Jedi followers including Karness Muur, Sorzus Syn, and XoXaan were exiled by the Jedi Order to the Stygian Caldera. These Dark Jedi exiles discovered and conquered the Sith civilization on Korriban, forging it into the Old Sith Empire. During his time in Korriban, Dreypa played an important role in founding the Sith Order, a Force order which harnessed the powers of the dark side and pitted themselves against the Jedi. Eventually, he and several other like-minded Dark Jedi became no longer content to rule over "mongrels" in exile and sought to return to the wider galaxy and wreak vengeance against the Jedi and the Galactic Republic.
            However, Dreypa's starship was intercepted and attacked by Jedi starships outside the Stygian Caldera. This pursuit eventually brought them to the remote planet of Kesh in the Unknown Regions. Both parties became trapped on the planet due to its strange magnetic field. Dreypa and his followers fought with the Jedi and devastated the planet. This battle would be remembered by the indigenous Keshiri people as the "Great Calamity" and evolved into the Keshiri legends of the Protectors and Destructors. In the end, Dreypa's Dark Jedi allies grew weary of his excesses and imprisoned him within his oubliette. They then made peace with their former Jedi adversaries and migrated to the planet's polar continent of Eshkrene where they established the Doomed, a Force-sensitive community which was devoted to finding a balance in the Force and protecting the Keshiri.
            Remulus Dreypa would remained imprisoned within his oubliette for almost four thousand years. For millennia, the descendants of the Doomed maintained a watchful vigil over Dreypa's prison and remembered him as the "Great Weapon." They were determined to prevent him from posing a threat to Kesh and the wider galaxy again. During his absence, a second group of predominantly Human Sith known as the Lost Tribe of Sith established themselves as the rulers of the Kesh. In 2974 BBY, the Tribe's reigning Grand Lord Varner Hilts dispatched an expeditionary mission to explore the planet's South Pole. This expedition included the Sith outcast Parlan Spinner and Hilt's own daughter Takara Hilts. After making contact with the Doomed, Spinner learnt about the "Great Weapon" and sought to use it to settle scores with the Tribe.
            Spinner and several Keshiri sailors stole Dreypa's oubliette and fled aboard their ship the Southern Star, which sailed back to Keshtah Minor, the Tribe's traditional domain. After awakening Dreypa, Spinner allied himself with the ancient Dark Lord, who was determined to return to the stars and to pursue vengeance against the Jedi and the Galactic Republic. However, he also agreed to help Spinner instigate a slave revolt against the Tribe. While Dreypa's newly-found allies had also taken Takara Hilts as a hostage, he lost this valuable leverage after the Sith princess and the Doomed leader Kaliska escaped back to Eshkrene and brought back the Doomed to battle Dreypa.
            Dreypa led his forces against the Tribe's military at the Battle of the Marisota Floodplain. Despite initial successes, they sustained heavy casualties at the hands of the Tribe's airborne Skyborn Rangers. Dreypa and his followers retreated to the volcano Sessal Spire where the Sith Lord turned the table on his pursuers by unleashing his Leviathans, reptilian Sithspawn capable of draining the life force of sentient beings. Dreypa's Leviathans quickly wiped out both his pursuers and former allies, whom he rejected for failing to live up to his rigid Sith philosophy. The Doomed also arrived and attempted to destroy Dreypa and his Leviathans but were also no match for his mastery of the dark side.
            Meanwhile, Lord Dreypa's former ally Spinner survived and allied himself with his former enemy Takara and the Doomed leader Kaliska. Prior to her death, Kaliska revealed that her people's Jedi forebears had hidden an operational interstellar-capable starship beneath the Circle Eternal, the Tribe's palace complex in their capital, Tahv. She urged them to destroy the starship in order to prevent the Sith Lord from returning to the galaxy. Following Kaliska's death, Dreypa learnt about the existence of this Jedi starship. He also defeated Takara in combat and took her hostage.
            Despite Lord Dreypa's efforts, his adversary Spinner succeed in reaching the Jedi Starship and bringing it into the space above Kesh. Dreypa used his holo-emitter to contact the younger Sith and demanded that he hand over the starship. Knowing Spinner's affection for Takara, he threatened to harm her unless Spinner handed over the starship. Meanwhile, Dreypa and his Leviathans laid waste to the Tribe's capital Tahv, devastating much of the city. However, Spinner turned the tide of the battle by using the starship's laser cannons to destroy all of the elder Sith's Leviathans. He also succeeded in retrieving both Takara and Dreypa from the battlefield and took the starship on a joyride to Sessal Spire.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Remulus_Dreypa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRemulusDreypa</string></dict>
        <key>Cin Drallig</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.719.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cin Drallig was a human male Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars. He was the head of the Jedi Temple Guard and a lightsaber instructor who was nicknamed "the Troll" by fellow Jedi. Drallig was killed by Darth Vader during the attack on the Jedi Temple.
            Early in his life, Cin Drallig, a human male, was personally trained by the Jedi High Council's Grand Master Yoda. Drallig eventually became the Jedi Order's finest master swordsman.[3] Drallig rose to the rank of Jedi Master and led the Jedi Temple Guard during the Clone Wars. As a Master, he was a teacher of lightsaber combat who passed his skills onto new generations of Jedi,[4] such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.[3] He earned the nickname "the Troll" from other members of the Jedi Order.[4]
            During the Clone Wars, the Jedi Temple was bombed by Padawan Barriss Offee. Before the perpetrator had been caught, the Jedi led an investigation to determine who was behind the attack. Skywalker approached Drallig, who was standing guard with the Temple Guard at the gates of the Jedi Temple, where protesters were demonstrating against the war and the Jedi Order's involvement in it. Skywalker showed Drallig a holographic image of their then-suspect, Jackar Bowmani, and asked the Jedi Master to be on alert for him. This led to the suspect's wife, Letta Turmond, being taken into custody after spotting the holographic image,[5] and the Jedi ultimately learned that Turmond was part of the plot to attack the Jedi Temple.[6]
            The Temple was later attacked by Captain Rackham Sear of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the attack, Drallig led two Temple Guards in securing the quarters of the Jedi younglings. He arrived just in time to cut a small explosive drone in half before it detonated in a room with several younglings. He ordered the guards to stay with the younglings and destroy any more explosives that entered the area. Drallig then joined Masters Mace Windu and Kenobi, reporting to them that the younglings were safe, but that there were explosions throughout the Temple and that the source was unknown. Master Depa Billaba and Initiate Caleb Dume ended the attack by confronting Sear on the roof of the Temple, where he committed suicide by leaping off the building.[7]
            At the end of the war, Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force and became Darth Vader, apprentice to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—secretly Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith. Vader attacked the Jedi Temple with the 501st Legion of clone troopers, while Palpatine issued Order 66 to force the clones to turn against the Jedi Order. Drallig fought to defend the Jedi Temple[8] alongside Padawans Whie Malreaux and Bene. The three Jedi were eventually confronted and slain in lightsaber combat by Darth Vader.[2]
            Sometime after his death, a holocron belonging to Drallig was sold in an auction on Denon to the noble Rin Praji, who had the holocron safekeeped at his estate on Kaikielius.[9]
            Drallig, the wielder of a green lightsaber, was a skilled swordsman who used his knowledge of lightsaber combat to train other Jedi.[2] He was nonetheless killed in lightsaber combat by Darth Vader[2] during the attack on the Jedi Temple.[8]
            For his brief appearance in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, Cin Drallig was portrayed by prequel trilogy stunt coordinator Nick Gillard, whose name was used as the basis for the character's name.[8] Drallig was later voiced by Robin Atkin Downes in "Sabotage," the seventeenth episode of the fifth season of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cin_Drallig</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCinDrallig</string></dict>
        <key>Davits Draven</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.720.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Davits Draven was a human male who served as a general in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. He was stationed at the Great Temple on the moon Yavin 4 when Jyn Erso was given the task of stealing the Death Star plans by Mon Mothma, a leader of the Rebel Alliance. Extraction Team Bravo, the team responsible for Jyn's break out of a labor camp on the planet Wobani, was under Draven's command.
            Davits Draven was born on Pendarr III in 45 BBY.[1]
            During the Clone Wars, Draven served in the Galactic Republic's military Intelligence. During this time, he never met any of the Jedi Generals in command of the Clone Army. Draven routinely worked with the Republic's strategists, fleet commanders, and other officers that would become part of the Empire's Military.[1]
            With an urgent drive to stop the Empire before it grew too powerful, Draven joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and was trained as a field operative by Airen Cracken. Prior to the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War, Draven carried out surgical strikes against the Empire, conducting sabotage, theft, and assassinations that earned unglamorous but necessary victories for the Alliance. He became a trusted officer, earning Mon Mothma's respect despite his no-nonsense attitude proving difficult at times, and served as a general and as the leading Alliance Intelligence officer on Yavin 4 in Cracken's absence. He typically caused Alliance High Command meetings to halt with his blunt speech and pragmatic views, and it often fell to Draven to make unpopular and difficult decisions.[1]
            In 0 BBY, he oversaw the mission he dubbed Operation Fracture in an attempt to piece together the puzzle of Galen Walton Erso's involvement with the Empire's Death Star project. Although some in the rebel council believed reports of the superweapon to be a ploy, Draven's firsthand experience with Imperial megalomania led him to believe the plausibility of the so-called "planet-killer".[1] Draven oversaw the rescue of Galen's daughter, Jyn Erso, to help with the mission. Meeting and speaking with her, Draven was not impressed with her defiance. After the briefing, he sent a notice to Mon Mothma strongly urging that she reconsider involving Erso in the mission. In Draven's mind, Erso was a Rebel deserter and a criminal who showed no loyalty to anyone except herself. Mothma overruled him, arguing that, besides them needing her to identify her father, Jyn Erso was much like other Rebels who had lost their way and deserved a second chance.[6] Nonetheless, he ordered Captain Cassian Jeron Andor to kill Galen Erso if he had the opportunity, countermanding his initial orders to extract the Imperial scientist for questioning.[3]
            As Operation Fracture got underway, Draven received a communication from Andor confirming the Destruction of Jedha City by the Death Star. The general reinforced the need to kill Erso, and sent a squadron of starfighters to his location on Eadu with assassination orders. However, Andor called in to inform Draven that Alliance operatives would be caught in the line of fire, but by that time the fighters were already engaged. The strike led to Erso's death, and Andor's team returned to Yavin 4. There, Jyn rallied the rebel council, and her Rogue One squad led a mission to Scarif to obtain the Death Star plans.[3]
            Following the Battle of Yavin and the assault on Sunspot Prison, Draven was placed in charge of the interrogation of Grakkus the Hutt after Alliance forces intercepted his prison transport vessel. Smuggler and rebel ally Han Solo was recruited to transport Grakkus, and it was Solo who suggested that instead of a typical interrogation, that they trick the Hutt into revealing his power base. Draven communicated over the radio to inform Solo and his first mate Chewbacca that they were sending X-wings to investigate the base on Teth.[7]
            Later, he was present at the Mako-Ta Space Docks, and was part of high-level briefings. He was critical of Leia Organa's plan to free King Lee-Char.[8] During the attack on the Mako-Ta Space Docks, Draven and other rebel forces accompanied Organa to sneak aboard the Executor in order to steal codes that disabled their rebel fleet. Organa was able to escape, while Draven and the other rebels held Darth Vader and Imperial forces back. After all the rebels were killed, Draven was killed by Vader when his neck was snapped through the ways of the Force.[2]
            Davits Draven was a human man with brown hair, blue eyes and light skin.[3] A veteran of the Clone Wars as part of Republic Intelligence,[1] Draven represented the Rebel Alliance's Intelligence. He and his operatives worked in the shadows performing unglamorous activities such as sabotage, infiltration and assassination, believing them to be necessary responses to the Galactic Empire's cruelty and power, thus becoming a person who made no apology for his methods.[9] He was vengeful and had something of a sadist in his personality, since before he died he desired to see Queen Trios paying for her treason and expressed that it would be wonderful to see Darth Vader burn alive.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Davits_Draven</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDavitsDraven</string></dict>
        <key>Dorja</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.721.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Captain Dorja of the Imperial Navy was a career military officer who commanded the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Relentless in the fleet of the Galactic Empire and later the Imperial Remnant. A Human male, Dorja embraced the tenets of Emperor Palpatine's New Order and took command of the Relentless prior to 4 ABY, during the Galactic Civil War between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. He was known for a cautious command style that saw his ship suffer no casualties, and he held his Star Destroyer back from the main combat lines at 4 ABY's Battle of Endor, an engagement with the Rebels that saw the Emperor killed and the Empire splinter into warlordism. Over the next five years, as Imperial Space was greatly diminished by the Alliance's successor state, the New Republic, Dorja plotted to seize control of the fleet from Captain Gilad Pellaeon. His plans were foiled, however, when the tactically gifted Grand Admiral Thrawn returned from the Unknown Regions in 9 ABY and was given control of the Empire. Dorja and the Relentless were put in command of the navy's secondary force, and Dorja saw his exclusion from the Grand Admiral's primary armada as a personal slight against himself.
            During Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic, the Relentless came across several high-profile enemy targets on the planet New Cov, and although they escaped from the Star Destroyer, Dorja captured the ship thief Niles Ferrier and presented him to Thrawn. Ferrier tracked down a number of dreadnaughts for the Grand Admiral that proved to be a turning point in the campaign, but Thrawn was later betrayed and killed by his bodyguard Rukh. His campaign came to an end, and by 19 ABY Dorja was serving the reorganized Imperial Remnant. When Pellaeon decided to sue for peace with the New Republic, his plans were sabotaged by a group of treasonous Imperials who included a con artist named Flim. Posing as a reborn Thrawn, Flim recruited Dorja to capture Pellaeon's courier before he could make any overtures to the New Republic. As Pellaeon waited in seclusion for peace talks that would not actually occur, Flim took to using the Relentless as his flagship while "Thrawn" expanded Imperial influence throughout the galaxy. When Dorja intercepted a covert New Republic strike at Imperial-held Yaga Minor, Pellaeon suddenly walked onto the ship's bridge and brought the ruse to an end. Peace accords were signed with the New Republic, and in the following years, Dorja's daughter Vana became a commander in the Imperial Navy.
            A Human male by the name of Dorja was born on the planet Coruscant[1] in or before the year 65 BBY[2] to a wealthy family[6] with a long tradition of military service to the Galactic Republic. His father, grandfather, and four more preceding generations had all been naval officers, with two of them having commanded a ship of the line and at least one having reached the rank of admiral. Dorja followed the family tradition and joined the Navy of the Galactic Empire[1] at some point after the Republic transitioned into the Empire in 19 BBY.[7] Around 2 BBY,[8] Dorja had a daughter, Vana.[9] Embracing the tenets of Galactic Emperor Palpatine's New Order, Dorja became the captain of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Relentless before the year 4 ABY.[1] He became known for a cautious tendency to not engage an enemy in direct combat, and for no casualties being suffered under his command.[3]
            In 4 ABY, as the Galactic Civil War raged between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, Emperor Palpatine drew the Rebels into a trap at the forest moon of Endor, where his massive Death Star II battlestation was under construction.[10] Death Squadron,[11] a task force of more than thirty Star Destroyers and support ships[12]—the Relentless among them[1]—was hidden behind the far side of Endor, and when the Alliance Fleet arrived in the system to destroy the incomplete Death Star, the trap was sprung. The Imperial fleet converged on the Rebels,[10] who were contained in-system by interdictor cruisers.[13] Dorja kept the Relentless removed from the Battle of Endor's main combat and thus suffered no casualties,[1] but the Rebels won the day when a strike team blew up the shield generator on\ the moon's surface that was protecting the Death Star, in turn allowing Rebel fighters to enter the battlestation and completely destroy it.[10]
            The Emperor was dead,[10] but the Imperial fleet continued to fight for nearly four hours.[14] Imperial morale became extremely low,[15] and after the destruction of Death Squadron's flagship, the Executor; the battlecruiser Pride of Tarlandia; and sixteen additional Star Destroyers; Captain Gilad Pellaeon of the Chimaera ordered a retreat to the planet Annaj.[11] Dorja almost refused to follow Pellaeon, an officer junior to himself, but he agreed with Pellaeon's bleak assessment of the situation.[1] After a two-day trip to Annaj, a council of war disintegrated when no clear chain of command could be established in the wake of Palpatine's death. Several officers deserted with their forces and declared themselves independent warlords.[11]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dorja</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDorja</string></dict>
        <key>Dorak</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.722.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dorak was a male Human Jedi Master and member of the Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council. He served as Chronicler of the Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War, and was one of the many Jedi Masters who trained Revan during the future Dark Lord's time as a Padawan.
            Dorak joined the Council on Dantooine at some point between 3964 BBY and 3956 BBY, replacing Bala Nisi. Being the Chronicler, he knew much of the history of the Order. He trained a Twi'lek, Deesra Luur Jada, to succeed him as the Chronicler of the Academy, passing all of his knowledge to him. Dorak was also in charge of giving apprentices their first lightsaber crystal and helping them choose their position in the Order. He would present them with a series of scenario questions and would see what pattern they fell into. He would give them his recommendation, but it was ultimately the apprentice's choice.
            During Revan's retraining at the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine, it was Master Dorak who introduced Revan to the basic tenets of the Order, teaching him fundamental history and discipline. The rest of Revan's training was taken care of by Master Zhar Lestin.
            Master Dorak survived Darth Malak's Sith bombardment and lived to see the end of the war. However, along with two other former members of the Dantooine Council, Vandar Tokare and Zhar Lestin, he was killed by Darth Nihilus during the Conclave on Katarr in 3952 BBY.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dorak</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDorak</string></dict>
        <key>Kinman Doriana</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.723.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kinman Doriana was a male Human who came from the Chommell sector world of Naboo and served as one of Palpatine's most trusted aides during both the Republic and Imperial eras. As such, he witnessed Palpatine's rise through the political hierarchy, first as Naboo ambassador and then senator of the Chommell sector, before finally achieving the rank of Supreme Chancellor. By the end of the Clone Wars, Doriana's friend—a Dark Lord of the Sith in secret—ultimately became the Emperor of the first Galactic Empire.
            Kinman Doriana was a male Naboo who experienced a troubled youth, which may have caused him to develop certain skills. These skills brought him to the attention of Palpatine, who–following the instructions of his Sith Master Darth Plagueis–befriended Doriana and involved him in his schemes.[1] Doriana became a "shadow advisor" to Palpatine, and few beings were aware of his name or position.[7] In 54 BBY,[8] several years after Palpatine first noticed Doriana, Doriana and Palpatine–who had become the ambassador-at-large for Naboo–attended a gala held for the victors of the Vinta Harvest Classic at the Eriaduan consulate on Malastare as members of Senator Vidar Kim's party. Sitting at a separate table from Senator Kim, Doriana and Palpatine conversed with an attractive, dark-haired female hostess.[1]
            Senator Kim's wife and children died in an starship crash on Naboo around the time of the Malastare gala, and Doriana subsequently attended their funeral in Theed with Janus Greejatus, another ally of Palpatine.[1] Vidar Kim was later assassinated, and Palpatine was appointed to succeed Kim as Naboo's Senator[9] in 52 BBY.[10] Senator Palpatine traveled to the galactic capital of Coruscant, and Doriana did the same,[9] acquiring a residence on the 238th floor of the Third Ring Apartment Towers.[11] Doriana received guidance on Coruscant's underbelly from Sate Pestage, another associate of Palpatine with whom Doriana formed an immediate bond. Along with Pestage and Greejatus, Doriana accompanied Palpatine at Vidar Kim's funeral service, held at Naboo's embassy on Coruscant.[9]
            As an aide of Senator Palpatine, Doriana worked with Pestage to maintain Palpatine's schedule, clandestinely attend to his dirty work,[12] and aid in the formulation of the Senator's plots and schemes.[13] Just over two standard months after Palpatine arrived on Coruscant, Doriana was present at Naboo's station in the Senate Rotunda as Palpatine announced Naboo's abstinence in the Senate's vote on whether to seat a number of Trade Federation client worlds.[14] In the weeks following the vote, Doriana and Pestage frequently accompanied Palpatine in his nighttime explorations of Coruscant.[15] Pestage later asked Doriana to monitor members of the Gran Protectorate who had established a contract with the Maladians to assassinate an unknown associate of Damask Holdings. The Maladians' target turned out to be Hego Damask–also known as Darth Plagueis–and Doriana failed to prevent the attempt on Damask's life.[16]
            In 33 BBY,[17] as Palpatine instigated the Yinchorri Crisis, Doriana, along with Sate Pestage, assisted in the dumping of Jedi corpses on the threshold of Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum and arranged for the infiltration of the Jedi Temple by Yinchorri warriors.[18] Doriana was later present at Palpatine's station in the Senate Rotunda, gossiping with Pestage while Chancellor Valorum addressed the ongoing Yinchorri situation.[19] Doriana, Pestage, and Palpatine later attended a Coruscant performance of the opera The Brief Reign of Future Wraiths as guests of Senator Orn Free Taa.[20] In 32.5 BBY,[21] Doriana and Pestage accompanied Palpatine at a special session at the Senate Rotunda, during which Chancellor Valorum called for renewed taxation of the trade routes to outlying systems.[22] In 32 BBY,[23] Palpatine's apprentice Darth Maul–who was aware of Doriana's identity[24]–injured an information broker named Lorn Pavan in the process of eliminating Hath Monchar, a treacherous associate of Palpatine, and Doriana and Pestage subsequently escorted Pavan downside to receive medical attention.[25]
            Doriana had become linked to Valorum's aide Sei Taria by the time of the Trade Federation's blockade of Naboo[26] later in 32 BBY,[23] and worked to further Palpatine's political interests during the blockade by coordinating with Pestage, Greejatus, Armand Isard, and others to plant incriminating evidence and expose certain cases of corruption. With Pestage, Doriana conceived a strategy to weaken the campaigns of Palpatine's primary rivals for the chancellorship: Senator Ainlee Team's protection of a Dug associate of Gardulla the Hutt and the Bando Gora would be exposed to Bail Antilles, who would in turn appear to be an overzealous reformer.[27] Following the call for a Vote of No Confidence against Chancellor Valorum, Doriana was present at Naboo's station in the Senate Rotunda with Pestage and Quarsh Panaka, and Magister Hego Damask edged past him and the other two men to meet with Palpatine.[28]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kinman_Doriana</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKinmanDoriana</string></dict>
        <key>Myn Donos</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.724.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Myn Donos, a Human male from Corellia, was an X-wing pilot who served with Talon, Wraith and Rogue Squadrons, primarily noted for his efforts during the hunt for Warlord Zsinj.
            Donos's life before joining Wraith Squadron was traumatic, even among his notoriously hard-luck squad mates. A sniper in the Corellian Armed Forces, Donos became a focused marksman. However, he felt his mind start nagging at him that what he was doing was wrong, as he often had to shoot his targets without giving them a chance.
            Looking for a place to put his doubts behind, Donos joined Starfighter Command, quickly rising through the ranks and becoming a lieutenant in a year. Given the rank of bevret Captain, Donos was given command of Talon Squadron upon graduation. When Talon Squadron was destroyed in an Imperial ambush on Gravan Seven—Donos being the sole survivor—he was removed from active service, but came to the attention of Wedge Antilles when Antilles and Wes Janson began assembling the commando/pilot hybrid squadron that would become Wraith Squadron. Janson recommended the traumatized pilot, as much from compassion as respect of Donos's pilot capabilities.[1]
            Prior to his New Republic military service, Donos was awarded the prestigious Corellian Bloodstripes by the Corellian military for conspicuous gallantry, but stopped wearing them after the debacle on Gravan Seven. Anguished by the obliteration of his men, Donos was morose and introverted during his early days with the Wraiths, where he flew as Wraith Nine and served as the squadron's sniper. Fellow pilot Falynn Sandskimmer, a tough woman from Tatooine, tried to help him through his depression and they developed a deep mutual attraction in the process.[1]
            In the battle that saw the destruction of the Implacable over Ession, Donos witnessed the death of both Sandskimmer and fellow Wraith Eurrsk Thri'ag. In this same battle he exacted a measure of revenge for Talon Squadron. He discovered Apwar Trigit's customized TIE/In starfighter fleeing the dying ship and teamed up with General Edor Crespin to chase him down. After Trigit initially refused to surrender, Donos launched a pair of proton torpedoes, denying Trigit a second chance to give up after his escort of two TIEs was destroyed. Trigit's ship was destroyed, killing the Admiral.[1]
            Shortly afterward, Donos began to fall in love with Lara Notsil, unaware that she was actually Gara Petothel, the woman who provided Trigit with the information he needed to eliminate Talon Squadron.[2] When Garik Loran inadvertently revealed her deception to the Wraiths at Kidriff 5, Donos tried to kill her, but nearly destroyed Loran instead. Antilles chose to report the firing of Donos's weapons as "accidental", provided Donos received medical and psychiatric treatment. With the help of his friends and comrades, Donos came out of his tailspin and rejoined the squadron as they prepared to attack Zsinj near Kuat. Following the battle with Zsinj at Selaggis Six, Myn accepted a position with Rogue Squadron, choosing to fly rather than remain with the Wraiths who joined New Republic Intelligence.[3]
            Following the conclusion of the Zsinj campaign, Donos and Petothel—who had taken the alias "Kirney Slane"—were married,[4] and by 40 ABY the pair had founded a transport company called "Donoslane Excursions" on Corellia.[5] They had also had at least two children by the year 44 ABY.[6]
            The likeness of Myn Donos was based on Bradley Wayne Hanson, a friend of Star Wars artist Joe Corroney.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Myn_Donos</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMynDonos</string></dict>

        <key>Tae Diath</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.726.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tae Diath was a male human Jedi Padawan serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Commander in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He was the apprentice of his uncle, Jedi Master Nico Diath.
            A Force-sensitive human born into a family which had produced a long line of Jedi Knights, Tae Diath was quickly turned over to the Jedi Order to begin the training. Selected by his uncle, Jedi Master Nico Diath as a Padawan, young Diath had a strong bond with his master, focusing on his mind whenever he felt his control of his telepathic abilities was slipping. Under his master's instruction, Diath crafted for himself a green-bladed lightsaber.[1]
            When the Clone Wars erupted between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Diath's took up ranks in the Grand Army of the Republic. Padawan Diath, now a Commander, led clone troopers against the Separatist Droid Army alongside his master; however, on a mission without his Padawan, Master Diath was slain on Queyta. Following his master's death, a grieving Diath was dispatched to the battlefields of Jabiim where he became one of the orphaned Padawans comprising the Padawan Pack.[1]
            As the group worked together to survive through the battle's harsh conditions, Padawan Diath was often distracted by his mentor's death, often making comments about his Master's great ability and power. Combined with the stresses of war, Diath's grief caused his telepathic abilities to act up, causing Diath much discomfort and lack of clarity. To aid her comrade, fellow Padawan Elora Sund forged a mental link with Diath which allowed him to remain calm and in control. As the battle surged forward, the Padawans attempted to stand as the final defense of the Republic's sole remaining base. Defending it from the Jabiimi Nationalists and their leader, Alto Stratus, Diath was killed by several vicious A-series assassin droids. Upon his death, Padawan Sund was simultaneously killed as a result of psychic backlash.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tae_Diath</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTaeDiath</string></dict>
        <key>Deacon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.727.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Deacon (or Deak) was a boyhood friend of Luke Skywalker who lived in Anchorhead on Tatooine.
            Deak was usually seen in the company of his friend Windy Starkiller, who he continually followed around Anchorhead. Another Tatooine acquaintance, Biggs Darklighter, once characterized Windy as "a follower" and called Deak "a follower of a follower".[2]
            Deak and Windy were present when Luke was challenged to a speeder race by a local braggart, Gorm Maldorf, in The Cage. The boys warned Luke that Maldorf was dangerous, but he accepted the challenge. On the morning of the race, Gorm was found dead, strangled, in The Cage. After Deak and Windy helped him make his escape, Luke investigated the death and deduced that Gorm had been accidentally killed while trying to sabotage the race the night before.[3]
            By their late teens, the friends were part of a group of youths that included Biggs Darklighter, Janek "Tank" Sunber, Laze "Fixer" Loneozner, and his girlfriend Camie. The teens spent time hanging around at Tosche Station in Anchorhead. They flew their T-16 skyhoppers in mock aerial duels and raced through twisting canyons near their homes.[2]
            When Biggs was accepted into the Academy, the friends and other locals threw him a party that was broken up by attacking Sand People.[4] Some time later, just before the Tantive IV was captured by Darth Vader above Tatooine, Luke challenged Fixer to a dangerous skyhopper race. Deak thought Luke had no chance of winning, and flew along with Fixer during the race. Deak last saw Luke on the morning Biggs confided in Luke about his plans to join the Rebel Alliance.[2]
            Deak was played by Jay Benedict in A New Hope, appearing only in the Anchorhead scene which didn't make it into the final cut of the film. The scene was later included in the Blu-Ray release. In the radio drama he was voiced by David Paymer. He has a single line in the script, although in the scene as shot, this seems to have been extended into a brief background conversation between himself and Windy. On the other hand, although Luke mentions mock-dogfights with Deak in the script, this line does not appear in the cut footage, which fades into the scene on the next line.
            "Deak Starkiller" first appeared in the rough draft of Star Wars as the younger brother of Annikin Starkiller and son of Kane Starkiller; he is killed by a Sith in one of the opening scenes. In the first draft he was renamed Bink Valor, which was probably the origin of Jar Jar Binks's last name. Bink suffered the same fate, however. His more heroic turn was as a Captain of a Rebel freighter and Aquillian Ranger in the second draft. He is the older brother of Luke Starkiller, Windy and Biggs. It is Deak who is imprisoned by the Galactic Empire and must be freed in this version, not Leia. He becomes one of Luke's friends at the power station in the third draft, with Windy.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Deacon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDeacon</string></dict>
        <key>Deenlark</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.728.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Deenlark was a male Commandant and President of the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant during the Age of the Empire. As a human hailing from the Core Worlds, Deenlark despised aliens and regarded people from Wild Space as "backward yokels." Deenlark had links to several prominent Coruscanti families that served as the Academy's benefactors. In the years leading up to the Galactic Civil War, Deenlark urged his Imperial cadets to put their allegiance to the Galactic Empire over their loyalties to their homeworlds and families. Several of Deenlark's students later went on to serve in the Imperial Navy including Grand Admiral Thrawn, Eli Vanto, Thane Kyrell, and Ciena Ree.
            During the early years of the reign of the Galactic Empire, Deenlark served as the Commandant and President of the prestigious Royal Imperial Academy on the Imperial capital Coruscant. The Academy supplied cadets to the Imperial Navy.[2] He gave a hostile reception to the Chiss warrior Thrawn and the Wild Space cadet Eli Vanto, who served as Thrawn's translator. Deenlark asked if their assignment was Admiral Foss's idea of a joke. When Vanto replied that the Emperor Palpatine had sent them, Deenlark mocked the Wild Spacer about having complicated words like "rhetorical."[4]
            After deriding Thrawn for being an "alien", Deenlark told Thrawn that he was lucky that the Emperor had taken a fancy to him. Deenlark then informed Thrawn that Foss had assigned him to an orientation course to acquaint the Chiss officer with Imperial procedure, equipment, and terminology. While this course normally took six months, Vanto was due to graduate in three months before commissioning. He gave Thrawn three months to complete the course and warned him that failure would get him kicked out of the course. When Thrawn replied that the Emperor would disagree, Deenlark responded that the Emperor had charged the Imperial Academies with producing officers worthy of Imperial service.[4]
            Before dismissing the pair, Deenlark informed Thrawn that Foss had assigned him the rank of lieutenant and handed him a lieutenant's rank insignia plaque. Deenlark then assigned a mouse droid to lead Thrawn and Vanto to their quarters at Barracks Two. Despite the hostility and snobbishness of the predominantly Core Worlds student body, Thrawn and Vanto excelled in their Academy studies. After Thrawn bested Spenc Orbar and Rosita Turuy in a game of cards, the two cadets hired three of their mates to attack Thrawn and Vanto.[4]
            Thrawn and Vanto reported the incident to Deenlark. Despite Vanto and Thrawn presenting evidence that Orbar and Turuy had used comlinks to contact the assailants, Deenlark was reluctant to take disciplinary action against the ringleaders since Orbar's family dominated Coruscanti society. Realizing that Deenlark was not interested in justice, Thrawn instead proposed transferring the three assailants to the Skystrike Academy. Thrawn argued that the attackers displayed the aptitude and aura necessary for starfighter pilots. While the assailants would not see it as a punishment, Thrawn reasoned that their abrupt disappearance would startle Orbar and Turuy and convince them to behave. Since this would avoid antagonizing the cadets' parents or organizing a court-martial, Deenlark agreed to Thrawn's plan.[4]
            After departing Deenlark's office, Thrawn recalled that he had seen a flatsculp on the left side wall of Deenlark's office. Vanto recalled that the flatsculp depicted a warship sailing on ocean waves. Thrawn concluded that the flatsculp was gift from a powerful Coruscanti family. Eli deduced that the Royal Imperial Academy was beholden to these families which meant that it was in Deenlark's interests to avoid a public confrontation. Despite Deenlark's disdain for Thrawn and Vanto, two cadets graduated from the Royal Imperial Academy second and third place. Thrawn would later become a Grand Admiral in the Imperial Navy while Eli became a Lieutenant Commander who served as the Empire's attache to the Chiss Ascendancy.[4]
            About four years before the Battle of Yavin, Deenlark presided over a welcoming ceremony that was attended by 8,000 cadets from all over the galaxy. Among the cadets were the cadets Thane Kyrell and Ciena Ree, who had come from the Outer Rim world of Jelucan. During the ceremony, Deenlark delivered a speech urging the cadets to think of themselves as citizens and soldiers of the Empire. He also urged the cadets to put their loyalty to the Empire above their allegiances to their homeworlds. He also urged the cadets to put the Empire over their families and compatriots. Despite Deenlark's words, Ciena and Thane resolved to continue their friendship.[2]
            Eventually the Academy's Office of Student Outcomes grew concerned about the close relationship between Ciena and Thane. They sabotaged Thane's TIE fighter's laser cannon and planted evidence implicating Ciena. When Commander Harn sent Ciena to Deenlark's office, Deenlark disbelieved Ciena's protestations of innocence and claimed that Thane was her only competitor for the top rank in their class. Shortly later, Harn arrived in his office with the cadet Jude Edivon, who presented evidence that the data logs had been tampered with.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Deenlark</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDeenlark</string></dict>

        <key>DJ</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.731.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"DJ," shortened form of "Don't Join," was the alias of a human male slicer who resided in the galaxy during the war between the Resistance and the First Order. An amoral thief, he spoke with a stutter but was also skilled at slicing into computer systems. His philosophy was influenced by his cynical views; he therefore believed that both sides in the conflict represented two halves of a system breeding corruption and greed.
            At the time of the Resistance's evacuation from the base on D'Qar, DJ was residing on the planet Cantonica where he used his skills to steal money from the wealthy patrons of the Canto Bight casino city. He offered his assistance for a price to the Resistance operatives Finn and Rose Tico after learning about their mission to recruit a codebreaker. Although he helped them infiltrate the First Order Navy flagship Supremacy, DJ chose to save his own life after they were captured by Captain Phasma and her stormtroopers.
            The man known only as "DJ," a nickname that was actually an acronym for his personal motto "Don't Join," lived during the era of the New Republic[2] as both a thief and as a slicer. As reflected in his motto, DJ lacked a belief in the black and white moralities of good and evil, and instead saw shades of gray, where no one was wholly good or wholly evil. The only factions to him were his side or the other's side, with his side being the only one that truly mattered. In his mind, good guys and bad guys simply did not exist.[3] When it came to the factions fighting the First Order–Resistance war, he saw the tyrannical First Order and the ambitious Resistance to be two sides of the same coin.[2]
            At some point, DJ took residence in an apartment located in Canto Bight, a city located on the desert world of Cantonica, a planet known for its casinos and racetracks.[4] The city turned into DJ's playground, where he used his slicing skills and equipment to steal money from Canto Bight's wealthy.[1] He also created a persona called "Denel Strench," a big time gangster who held DJ as his last living associate. Strench's name became known through Canto Bight, with a handful of individuals believing Strench to be real. In truth, the persona was created to serve DJ to take the fall for his own crimes. The Canto Bight Police Department's record on Strench eventually became the longest in the sector.[3]
            Shortly after the Hosnian Cataclysm[3] in 34 ABY,[5] DJ patronized the Coruscant Hotel and Casino, where he hit the gaming tables for Eclipse—a holographic card game—with a large sum of stolen money with the intention of stealing even more money by rigging an Eclipse table with virused cash. By uploading corrupted money into the Eclipse table, the game would perform in his favor where the more money he put in, the more money he could withdraw. Ultimately, his plan was to spend a week at Zord's Spa and Bathhouse. DJ eventually settled for a table where he found himself heckled by the gambling protocol droid O1-MG. Unaware of DJ's scheme, the droid was dumbfounded by DJ's aggressive betting and the incredible amounts of money he was losing.[3]
            The droid ignored DJ's comments to mind his own, and became increasingly vocal as DJ tipped a waitress and the game's Zabrak dealer with all but one of his betting chips. However, the droid's pestering was culled by Oosha Choi and Pol Ipol, a pair of Canto Bight Police Department detectives known as honest cops, and as such derided by DJ as suckers. As it happened, they were there to warn DJ and interrogate him about Denel Strench, whom they believed was after him due to a series of events that began with the detectives hunting down the arms dealer Flestic Crupp. However, the officers were put off by DJ's nonchalant attitude and the dismissal of the deaths of the "good men" on their squad. When Ipol tried to force DJ to come with him, he was stopped by the Coruscant Hotel and Casino's owner, Jorka Edy. The officers were kicked out of the casino for harassing a customer, and DJ was left to continue his scam.[3]
            After tipping the dealer again, DJ made for the door, having contacted the security team of the Vesustrian resort for an escort to their casino sometime earlier. However, Edy had learned of DJ's scam and followed him out, only to be confronted by Ipol, Choi, and the Vesustrian security team led by a brutish security guard named Dezmoont. All three parties avoided making a scene by letting Dezmoont escort DJ to the Vesustrian, with Edy doing so in the hopes that a rival casino would fall to the same scam.[3]
            After welcoming DJ to the Vesustrian, Dezmoont revealed that he was well aware of DJ's abilities and promised to keep a close eye on him during the duration of his stay. As such, the security guard stuck himself to DJ's side at every stop DJ made, which included a visitation to a fathier track, a tauntaun display, and an upscale restaurant. Upon learning that DJ was apparently being followed by Strench, however, Dezmoont upped the security surrounding DJ.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/DJ</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDJ</string></dict>
        <key>Zett Jukassa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.732.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zett Jukassa (born Warpoc Skamini)[1] was a male Human Padawan serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic in the final days of both institutions. Apprenticed to Jedi Master Mierme Unill at the start of the Clone Wars, he was reassigned to Temple Battlemaster Cin Drallig following Unill's death. Jukassa was stationed at the Coruscant Jedi Temple with Drallig when the ancient edifice was invaded by the Grand Army of the Republic under the orders of the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Fleeing the Temple, Jukassa was shot and killed by Clone Sergeant Fox in front of Senator Bail Organa.
            Born to Sembric and Ashielle Skamini on the Mid Rim world of Mon Gazza, the young boy named Warpoc Skamini was identified as a newborn to be Force-sensitive and sent by his parents to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training in the ways of the Force.[1] While studying at the Temple academy, a seven year old Jukassa began to receive visions of his parents' brutal murder on his homeworld. Unaware of his heritage per Order policy, Jukassa's plight reached the ears of the Jedi investigating the murders, Jedi Knight Mierme Unill. With the permission of the Jedi High Council, Unill and Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu related the facts of the murders to Jukassa in hopes that he could ease the boy's suffering, and discover clues to the murderer's identity. Unill's intuition proved correct in this case, leading him to uncover ties to Black Sun in his investigation thanks to Jukassa's assistance. Following the arrests, Unill was so impressed with Jukassa's maturity and strength that he selected him to be his Padawan apprentice.[1]
            While Jukassa seemed to show a propensity for the ability known as Farsight, Unill did not have time to expand on this ability as the tensions between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems interrupted regular training within the Order. Called into service within the Grand Army of the Republic, Jukassa was given the rank of Commander and aided his Master in campaigns outside the Temple walls. While on the battlefield, Unill was slain by the Separatist Droid Army, leaving Jukassa an orphaned Padawan and confined to the Temple on Coruscant. Continuing his studies at the academy, he was temporarily assigned to Temple Battlemaster Cin Drallig.[1]
            Following the deaths of Count Dooku and General Grievous, the High Council moved against the Supreme Chancellor who was in fact the elusive Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious. Still stationed at the Temple, Master Shaak Ti armed him and other Padawan and Knights as the Temple went on high alert. Under the leadership of Darth Vader, the Grand Army that the Jedi had served side-by-side with invaded the Temple, slaying all within. Fleeing to the upper levels, Jukassa fought his way through one of the hangars and onto the landing platform. Out in the night air, Jukassa raced for the recently landed speeder that belonged to Senator Bail Organa, a long time supporter and friend of the Jedi who had come to investigate the smoke rising from the ancient edifice. On his way to freedom, Jukassa cut through eight troopers wounding the assault's leader, Commander Appo, in the process. However, before he could make it to the speeder, Jukassa was shot dead by the accurate blaster-handling of Sergeant Fox. Fleeing the scene after Jukassa's death, Senator Organa departed Coruscant in search of any surviving Jedi.[2]
            After the fighting at the Temple came to a close, the clone troopers cross-checked the names of the dead with the Temple Archives' records. After he was recorded as dead, his body was burned on the steps of the Temple's public entrance along with all of the other dead from within.[2]
            As official documents were pulled together by the Imperial Sate Pestage, the Galactic Empire issued propaganda stating Jukassa was neutralized after he was heard threatening to kill Senator Organa. The true account of his death was presented to Emperor Palpatine, but was never made public.[3]
            Zett Jukassa possessed a strong connection to the Force and was gifted in the rare ability of farsight. One of the Jedi Temple's most promising students, Jukassa put up a valiant defense during the raid on the Jedi Temple. Impressively the young Padawan almost escaped the Temple, but was finally shot down by Sergeant Fox before he could reach Bail Organa's speeder.[1]
            Zett Jukassa was played by Jett Lucas, son of George Lucas. When naming the character, many possibilities were discussed, including Titi Jukassa, Tado Jukassa, and Tado. Eventually a tuckerization of the name Lucas was created: Jukassa, and Jett's name was simply modified to Zett.[1]
            Jett Lucas also played the Padawan Warpoc Skamini in Attack of the Clones, though after the release of Revenge of the Sith, the two characters were merged into one with a backstory.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zett_Jukassa/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZettJukassa</string></dict>

When Jhoff asked the shuttle to identify itself, he was soon joined by Admiral Firmus Piett and Darth Vader, who asked for the shuttle's desired landing area, and the Dark Lord of the Sith, after some hesitation due to Vader sensing his son, Luke Skywalker, on board the shuttle, requested for Jhoff to deactivate the deflector shield and let the shuttle make its desired landing on Endor.
            During the Battle of Endor, Jhoff was still present on the bridge when Commander Merrejk announced to Piett that the ship was in attack position, but Piett had orders from Emperor Palpatine to only keep the Rebel fleet from escaping, and held the ship's current position. When an A-wing crashed into the bridge, Jhoff was killed along with the rest of the the bridge crew.

            Jonah Carter was a paladin of the brave Corellian people against the criminal scum and the corrupt officials within CorSec and the government. Having survived the political purge that preceded the Imperial takeover of the Corellian government, Commissioner Carter had become a leader of the civilian resistance attempting to push them off of the planet during the Battle of Corellia. In the end the Sith Lord Darth Tormen sent a famous bounty hunter after him.
            Upon being confronted in CorSec HQ, Carter assumed that the Hunter was sent to kill him and warned the mercenary that the Corellian people would be rioting in the streets as a result. However, the Hunter revealed that killing him was not the objective. Guessing that the hunter was working for the Empire, Carter grimly reminded the Hunter that their employers were not common criminals but despots. He warns that if he was taken down, Corellia would be forced to bow before the Sith and asked if the Hunter's conscience was wiped clean by their credits. The Hunter stated that it would be better than Corellians being massacred. Carter then took the opportunity to jump out of the way as his men in the upper levels dropped a flash grenade that briefly blinded the Hunter and their companion. Despite having the initial advantage, Carter and his men were defeated. Acknowledging that he was beaten, Carter told the Hunter that Corellia would outlast the Empire, but his opponent did not care for his idealism and froze him in carbonite. Upon being delivered to Darth Tormen, the Sith Lord unfroze the commissioner and forced him into signing a treaty dictating Corellia's secession from the Republic.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jonah_Carter</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJonahCarter</string></dict>
        <key>Jones</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.739.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jones was a human male who served as a captain and flight officer in the Resistance during its war against the First Order. Circa 34 ABY, Jones assisted Lieutenant Kaydel Ko Connix in evacuating the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar. When First Order Star Destroyers arrived at D'Qar during the evacuation, Connix instructed Jones to leave the base's munitions and get the remaining Resistance personnel aboard the departing transports.
            Jones was a flight officer[3] and captain in the Resistance navy[2] during the war against the First Order.[1] Shortly after the Battle of Starkiller Base in 34 ABY, which saw the destruction of the First Order superweapon,[4] Jones was stationed at the Resistance base[1] on the Outer Rim planet D'Qar,[5] where he assisted in the Resistance's evacuation.[1]
            During the frantic evacuation, as Jones and Lieutenant Kaydel Ko Connix strode across the base's landing field, he informed her that thirty pallets of cannon shells were still in storage. With time running short, Connix told Jones to leave the munitions and ensure that the remaining personnel boarded the lifeboats departing to the Resistance cruiser Raddus.[1]
            However, as Connix finished speaking, several First Order Star Destroyers arrived in the D'Qar system, catching the pair's attention.[1] Fearing that the First Order would send slicers and droids to scour the Resistance databanks, Connix ordered Jones to oversee the destruction of the computers before evacuating.[3]
            Jones was a tall human male with light skin, blue eyes, brown hair, and a beard. He wore a badge on his tan uniform,[1] displaying his rank as a naval captain.[2]
            Jones first appeared in the 2017 sequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi, which was written and directed by Rian Johnson. Jones has the first line of dialogue in the film. The character was portrayed by actor Jack Greenlees, who was credited as "Resistance Evacuation Officer."[1]
            Jones was first named in Jason Fry's novelization and audiobook of the film, which were released in 2018. The character's role in the novelization differs slightly from the film: In the book, Jones speaks to Connix after the First Order's arrival at D'Qar, rather than before, and protocol droid PZ-4CO is also present.[3] Jones also appears in the non-canon junior novelization William Shakespeare's Jedi the Last, though he is only identified as "Soldier 1."[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jones</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJones</string></dict>
        <key>Qui-Gon Jinn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.740.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Qui-Gon Jinn was a highly respected, yet maverick and unconventional Human male Jedi Master, who lived during the last decades of the Galactic Republic and was most notably responsible for discovering Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One of the Jedi prophecy, and bringing him into the Jedi Order. An adherent of the Living Force, Jinn always kept his focus in the moment and often clashed with and even openly defied the Jedi High Council. Born in 92 BBY, Qui-Gon Jinn was raised at the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant before being apprenticed at the age of ten to Jedi Knight Dooku. After years of training under Dooku, Jinn achieved the rank of Jedi Knight and—after successfully training a Padawan of his own, a farmer's son named Feemor—became a Jedi Master himself. Shortly after that, Jinn took on a second Padawan, a prodigy named Xanatos, whom Jinn had himself discovered and had brought to the Jedi Temple earlier. Jinn was marveled by his Padawan's prowess so much that he turned a blind eye to Xanatos's flaws, namely his desire for power.
            However, Jinn was faced with his Padawan's true nature during a mission to stop a civil war on Xanatos's homeworld of Telos IV. During the mission, Xanatos fell to the dark side of the Force and sided with his father Crion, the power-hungry Governor of the planet, who had orchestrated the insurgency to further his own goals. In order to stop the war, Jinn had to confront Crion, who was accidentally killed in the process. Xanatos fled from the planet, swearing revenge on his Master. Devastated by his apprentice's betrayal, Jinn blamed himself for Xanatos's fall, believing in his inability as a Master and renouncing his earlier success with Feemor. Jinn swore never to take another apprentice, until he crossed paths with a Jedi trainee named Obi-Wan Kenobi during a mission to the planet Bandomeer in 44 BBY. Jinn took Kenobi as his third apprentice, starting their long training together. Over the course of the next twelve years, Jinn and Kenobi participated in numerous missions across the galaxy, most notably fighting side by side against Xanatos, who attempted to exact revenge on his former Master. Ultimately, the fallen apprentice took his own life when cornered by Jinn and his new Padawan on Telos, ending that dark chapter in Jinn's life.
            In 32 BBY, Jinn and Kenobi were assigned by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum as ambassadors to the Trade Federation, which had recently blockaded the planet Naboo in protest against the recent taxation laws introduced by the Galactic Senate. The Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray, however, attempted to dispose of the Jedi, launching an invasion of Naboo. Escaping to the surface of the planet, Jinn and Kenobi saved the Queen of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, agreeing to escort her to Coruscant in order to report the Trade Federation's act of aggression, but their ship's hyperdrive was damaged, forcing them to make a stop for repairs on the lawless world of Tatooine. It was under the twin suns of Tatooine that Jinn discovered Anakin Skywalker, a young slave boy with great Force potential, who helped the Jedi obtain the money to buy the replacement T-14 hyperdrive generator by risking his life at the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. Convinced that the boy was the Chosen One who was supposed to bring balance to the Force, Jinn secured Skywalker's release from slavery and brought him to the Jedi Temple, narrowly escaping from an attack by the Sith Lord Darth Maul in the process.
            Believing that Kenobi was ready to become a Jedi Knight, Jinn asked for Skywalker to be assigned as his new apprentice. However, the Jedi Council refused Jinn's request, believing Skywalker to be too old for Jedi training and potentially dangerous. Jinn then accompanied Amidala back to Naboo, helping her to liberate her world from the Trade Federation. During the battle, Jinn and Kenobi faced off against Darth Maul, and the Jedi Master was struck down by the Sith, before Kenobi cut him in half. With his final words, Jinn asked Kenobi to train Skywalker as his Padawan. Following the battle, Kenobi was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight, and Skywalker was accepted into the Jedi Order. Kenobi fulfilled his promise to his later Master, training Skywalker for the next ten years. Even though Jinn died on Naboo, he continued to have great influence on the future of the Jedi. Having long ago learned how to preserve one's consciousness with the Force, Jinn remained as a Force ghost, eventually passing the secret to Kenobi and Grand Master Yoda. Even though Skywalker fell to the dark side—becoming the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader and leading to the fall of the Galactic Republic, the rise of the Galactic Empire in its stead and the near-destruction of the Jedi Order—he eventually fulfilled the prophecy just as Jinn had foreseen, killing his Sith Master Darth Sidious and returning to the light in his final moments.
            Qui-Gon Jinn was a Human male[4] born in 92 BBY[2] on a terrestrial planet.[1] Within the first six months after his birth,[14] Jinn was identified as a Force-sensitive and was taken from his homeworld to the galactic capital of Coruscant to train at the Jedi Temple and become a Jedi.[4] He maintained some ties with his planet of birth, however, and even obtained a special smooth Force-sensitive stone from his home planet's River of Light as a keepsake, while he was no older than thirteen.[1][4] At the age of eight, Jinn participated in a training exercise at a Coruscant lake along with his class. The younglings scaled a nearby cliff with cable launchers several times, learning to keep their balance. The trainees were to repeat the same task a week later, albeit without the cable launchers and under the supervision of a Jedi Master as part of their Force training. Jinn, however, did not want to wait for another week and, after everyone else had left, he remained at the lake, contemplating to climb the cliff alone. His thoughts were soon interrupted by a young girl from his class called Tahl, who playfully dared Jinn to race her to the top of the cliff. Jinn tried to use the Force to help him in the ascent, but that day, Tahl felt a deeper connection with the Force and beat Jinn to the top. Although his pride was somewhat hurt, the young Jinn did not show it. He and Tahl then jumped from the cliff into the cool water of the lake, enjoying the refreshing feeling. At that moment, Tahl saw someone coming in their direction. Since the two of them were supposed to be in meditation and not playing in the water, Jinn and Tahl hid behind a rock and saw Grand Master Yoda passing them by. Both barely restrained each other from laughing, and Yoda walked away without noticing the two.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascQuiGonJinn</string></dict>
        <key>Micah Giiett</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.741.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Micah Giiett was a male Human who served the Jedi Order during the final years of the Galactic Republic before the return of the Sith Lords. A highly respected member of the Jedi High Council, Master Giiett served for many years prior to the Yinchorri Uprising of 33 BBY.
            A master swordsman, Master Giiett had training in the ways of the Jedi Sentinel, believing that Jedi should not rely solely on the Force to get the job done. A contemporary of the Master of the Order, Master Mace Windu, and fellow Councilor Plo Koon, Giiett's final mission took him to the planet Yinchorr. There Giiett fought valiantly, sacrificing himself in the end so that his comrades could escape.
            If Micah Giiett had a traditional Jedi upbringing, he was most certainly discovered by doctors on his homeworld to be Force-sensitive; doctors who then would have notified the Jedi Temple of their discovery. After being recruited by a member of the Acquisition Division, Giiett would have been inducted into the Temple's academy on Coruscant and begun training in a clan of younglings. Eventually graduating from the academy, Giiett was chosen by a Jedi Master to continue his training in the field. After years of study, Giiett passed the Trials of Knighthood and was promoted to a full Knight of the Order.[3]
            Following the path of the Jedi Sentinel, Jedi Giiett eventually was promoted to the rank of Master himself. A well respected man within the Order and a wielder of dual yellow-bladed lightsabers, Giiett's unusual style of teaching made him identifiable as a Sentinel; he often would point out to his students that they could not and should not rely solely on the Force to solve their problems. One of his most prolific teaching methods involved four cups and four stones. He would tell his students that three of the stones were white, and one of them was black. Hiding each stone under one cup he would shuffle the cups and ask where the black stone was. Using the Force to track the cup they believed the black stone to be under, most students would accurately point to the cup where Master Giiett had said he put the black stone. In fact however, through slight of hand there was no black stone in play: all cups had a white stone under it. The lesson of the demonstration was that, while the use of the Force could make things easy, a Jedi should not be so overconfident that they did not expect the unexpected or believe everything they saw. This trick derived from the Master's belief that any trained Force-user could make a good gambler, but the Force doesn't trump the powers of a logical and attentive mind.[1]
            In 53 BBY, Giiett and Yoda summoned Jedi Masters Qui-Gon Jinn and Tahl along with Jinn's Padawan Xanatos and masterless Orykan Tamarik. The two Jedi dispatched the team to Telos to settle a civil war on the planet. After Xanatos challenged Yoda and the briefing was concluded, Giiett soberly and reflectivly asked if Xanatos was ready to become a Jedi Knight. Yoda replied by saying that if he was not ready then he could never become a Jedi. The mission saw Xanatos turn to the dark side and abandon the Jedi Order.
            During his tenure on the Jedi High Council, Giiett would embark on some missions in service to the Order. When he was away for long periods of time, the Jedi Knight Ki-Adi-Mundi would sit in for Giiett. At one stage, Qui-Gon Jinn's Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi briefly left the Jedi to assist The Young on Melida/Daan in 44 BBY. When he returned, he appealed to the council to return, and it was Mundi that sat in for Giiett at this time. A couple of years later, Jinn was kidnapped by the scientist Jenna Zan Arbor. Giiett had returned from a mission and resumed his duties on the council.[4] Jinn was rescued sometime later on Simpla-12.
            At some point, Masters Giiett and Koon were assigned a mission to Ord Mantell. The famed chef, Slabba Drewl, had been captured by the notorious Corpo the Hutt and the Jedi were petitioned to send a rescue party. Bargaining with the Hutt, the Master Giiett entered into a cooking match with the Hutt's personal kitchen droid, MREM-02; if Giiett won the contest, Drewl would be freed from his cell. While Giiett prepared two small dishes of Squirmer Stew, the portly Jedi instructed Master Koon to sabotage the droid's ingredients. The Kel Dor secretly replaced the droid's seebo sauce with droid oil, and slips gundark droppings, Rakririan Burnout Sauce and Bothan foot powder into the competition's pot. While Master Giiett's platters do not overwhelm the judge's, the droid's ruined meals can not compete and the Jedi is named victorious. Staying true to his word, Corpo releases the imprisoned chef and the Jedi return him to Coruscant.[5]
            Master Giiett was at the Temple when he selected a young woman to train as a Padawan; this Kuati native would go on to be his last apprentice, she was named Bultar Swan.[2]
            In 33 BBY Master Giiett was assigned by the Council to a mission that would see the end of the Yinchorri Uprising. One of several Masters assigned to the mission, Master Giiett left young Swan at the Temple and boarded one of three Consular-class cruisers along with Master Koon, Jedi Lilit Twoseas, and her Padawan K'Kruhk. Heading for Yibikkoror, Giiett demonstrated the lightsaber-resistant properties of cortosis vambraces to Twoseas' Padawan. Upon their ships arrival in orbit over Yibikkoror Giiett's cruiser was attacked by Yinchorri attack ships and they were forced to take extreme measures. Baiting their attackers with the launch of an empty escape pod, the Jedi managed to crash land their damaged ship on a floating residence platform, the Jedi fought their way through swarms of flutter-pack equipped Yinchorri. While Master Koon used the planet's gases to blind their assailants, Master Giiett contacted Master Adi Gallia's cruiser for immediate rescue.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Micah_Giiett</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMicahGiiett</string></dict>

        <key>Jeremoch Colton</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.743.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jeremoch Colton was a Human male who served as the pilot of the Sundered Heart during the Clone Wars, and had a long record of service in the Royal House of Alderaan. He wore the same uniform as the rest of the Sundered Heart crew, and he had blond hair and blue eyes. He is not to be confused with Captain Raymus Antilles, who had overall command of Sundered Heart and considered Colton to be his mentor.[2]
            Colton had a long career as a pilot of the Royal House of Alderaan. At the end of the Clone Wars, he served under Captain Raymus Antilles on board the Sundered Heart during its return to Coruscant after Bail Organa rescued Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi during the execution of Order 66.
            Colton was among the crew aboard the Sundered Heart when Bail Organa, Yoda, and Obi-Wan Kenobi went on the search for surviving Jedi. He answered the call of Mas Amedda when Bail Organa's presence in the Senate was asked by Emperor Palpatine. Having learned the tricks of the trade, Colton planned to retire from active service and decided to teach at the University of Alderaan until it was destroyed years later during the Galactic Civil War.[2] Presumably Colton was among the victims of Alderaan's destruction.[1]
            Jeremoch Colton was played by Jeremy Bulloch, the same actor who portrayed Boba Fett in the original trilogy. "Jeremoch" is an obvious portmanteau of his name.
            The name Colton Antilles is given for Raymus Antilles in some sources, leading some fans to believe that the Captain Antilles in A New Hope is a separate character named Colton Antilles, possibly named after the Captain Colton in Revenge of the Sith. However, Leland Chee has confirmed that both Captains Antilles are meant to be the same person.[3][4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jeremoch_Colton</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJeremochColton</string></dict>

        <key>Tiaan Jerjerrod</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.745.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tiaan Jerjerrod was a human male who served in the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. Initially an architect and a starship designer, he was eventually granted the rank of Imperial Moff. Prior to and during the Battle of Endor, he was made commander of the Death Star II partly owing to his previous work on the original Death Star. Tasked with overseeing the space station's difficult final stages of assembly, Jerjerrod faced the wrath of both the Sith Lord Darth Vader and Emperor Sheev Palpatine when the massive construction effort fell behind schedule. Despite warnings from Vader that the Emperor would not tolerate any further setbacks, the Emperor paid little attention to Jerjerrod when he visited the Death Star, though he did authorize the commander to operate the station's superlaser against the starships of the Rebel fleet when the Rebel Alliance launched its attack on the Death Star—a battle that culminated in the station's destruction and the death of all its occupants, including Jerjerrod.
            A human male from the Core World[8] of Tinnel IV, Tiaan Jerjerrod[1] was born in 35 BBY.[2] He hailed from a wealthy family.[8] In his youth, he attended an engineering academy until his high grades earned him a job drafting plans for warehouses. Later, his plans for a freight depot on Ord Mantell drew the attention of the Corellian Engineering Corporation, and he was hired as a starship designer. Eventually, his designs for an interstellar trash hauler led him to serve the Galactic Empire.[6]
            By the sixth year of the Empire's reign, Jerjerrod held the rank of Rear Admiral, and was a member of the Joint Chiefs.[7] He helped build the first Death Star,[6] a moon-sized battle station that used kyber crystals to generate a planet-destroying superlaser.[1] Jerjerrod told himself that such a weapon would provide a defense for the Empire simply by existing, deterring attacks without ever being used. However, the Empire did use the megaweapon, blowing up the planet of Alderaan. Although extremely powerful, the station was finally destroyed when a pilot of the enemy Rebel Alliance fired two proton torpedoes into an unprotected thermal exhaust port.[6]
            Eventually, Tiaan Jerjerrod became one[6] of the twenty[7] Imperial Moffs.[6] Despite the fiasco of the original superweapon, the Emperor ordered the construction of a second Death Star above the Forest Moon of Endor.[9] Moff Jerjerrod was assigned to supervise the difficult endeavor of completing that superweapon,[3] and was given the cover title of Director of Imperial Energy Systems due to the project's secrecy.[4] In order to fulfill his difficult mandate, Jerjerrod exhausted himself day after day, slaving over the plans and filing endless paperwork. The Moff notably made sure that all the exhaust ports of the new station were heavily armored, thus fixing the fatal flaw of the original Death Star. However, the architect faced a number of problems, ranging from budget cuts and supply chain breakdowns to the shortage of construction workers.[6]
            Eventually, the glaring lack of progress on the Death Star prompted Darth Vader, the personal enforcer of Emperor Sheev Palpatine, to travel to the station to rectify the situation. Upon learning that Vader's transport had touched down inside one of the Death Star's hangar bays, Jerjerrod ventured to the hangar to greet the Emperor's emissary as he disembarked from his shuttle.[5] Feeling secure enough in his position,[3] Jerjerrod planned to show Vader his detailed daily reports, hoping that the emissary might take his side and realize the Emperor was asking for the impossible.[6] However, after brushing aside Jerjerrod's formal greeting, Vader bluntly informed the commander of the purpose behind his impromptu visit—the Emperor had become displeased with the Death Star's slowing construction, and Vader would see to it that the station was completed on schedule. At first, Jerjerrod protested that the task was understaffed and nearly impossible given the circumstances, but when the Sith Lord announced that the Emperor was to personally oversee the station's completion, the Moff pledged himself and his crew to a renewed effort, heeding Vader's mocking warning that the Emperor would not tolerate failure.[5]
            Driven by the fear of the Emperor's arrival, the Moff exhausted himself and his workers for several weeks. In spite of his best effort, the Moff was unable to finish the station before his master's arrival, and one whole hemisphere was still covered in scaffolding and girders.[6] When Palpatine finally arrived aboard the Death Star with great fanfare, Jerjerrod joined Vader and a group of Imperial officers to welcome their ruler and his retinue.[5] The Moff had hoped that he would be rewarded for his hard work.[6] However, despite Vader's earlier warnings, the Emperor ignored Jerjerrod and the other officers as he conversed with Vader about their grand plan to deal with the Rebel Alliance, with which the Empire had been at war for some time, and Luke Skywalker, a young Rebel commander who happened to be Vader's son.[5] Jerjerrod realized that not having displeased his master was enough of a reward.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tiaan_Jerjerrod</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTiaanJerjerrod</string></dict>

        <key>Kanan Jarrus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.747.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kanan Jarrus, born Caleb Dume, was a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Knight who survived Order 66 during the Clone Wars. Living on thanks to the sacrifice of his Master, Depa Billaba, on Kaller, he met the smuggler Janus Kasmir, who taught him how to survive as a fugitive. Going into hiding, he forsook the Jedi ways for some time, swapping his blue-bladed lightsaber for a blaster. After working with the Twi'lek rebel operative Hera Syndulla during the Gorse conflict, Jarrus decided to join her nascent rebel cell.
            As Syndulla's second-in-command, the two came to develop a romantic relationship. After the Force-sensitive teenager Ezra Bridger joined the Spectres, Jarrus became his Jedi mentor despite still being a Padawan. After defeating the Grand Inquisitor in combat, Jarrus and his fellow rebels learned they were part of a larger rebellion and joined Phoenix Cell. During a mission to Malachor, Jarrus was blinded by the former Sith Lord Maul. After months of retreat, Jarrus restored his connection to the Force and repaired his frayed relationship with Bridger with the help of a mysterious being called Bendu, who taught him to see things through the Force.
            The reinvigorated Jarrus and his fellow rebels would continue fighting various adversaries including Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn and Maul, who sought to corrupt Bridger and destroy Obi-Wan Kenobi, the key to destroying the Sith. Regaining his confidence, Jarrus also taught the Mandalorian rebel Sabine Wren how to wield the Darksaber and helped her to rally the Mandalorians over to the rebel cause. As the Rebel Alliance escalated its struggle with the Empire, Kanan and his fellow rebels returned to free Lothal, a world which they had a special connection with.
            Jarrus eventually met his death one year before the Battle of Yavin on Lothal, during the rescue of Hera Syndulla after Governor Arihnda Pryce ordered her walker to fire on the fuel pod they were on, sacrificing himself to allow his fellow rebels to escape. Following Jarrus' death, he became a part of the Cosmic Force, manifesting as a huge loth-wolf named Dume, which appeared to Ezra several times. Later, Hera gave birth to their son, whom she named Jacen.
            A human male, Caleb Dume was born thirty-three years before the Battle of Yavin, during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. As he was integrated into the Jedi Order at a very young age,[2] he would never know his parents,[17] for he went straight from his homeworld to the Jedi Temple[18] on Coruscant, where he would be raised as a Jedi.[1]
            As a youngling, Dume met Jedi Master Luminara Unduli once, remembering her as "brave, compassionate and disciplined." He often heard Grand Master Yoda say "Do, or do not. There is no try," although he did not fully comprehend what Yoda meant[19] during his practice duels with fellow initiates such as Sammo Quid and Tai Uzuma.[14] He also did some saber training with Ahsoka Tano.[20]
            One day away from the Initiate Trials, Dume was in a practice duel with Uzuma and Quid under Yoda's instructions, when he tripped and hit his head against the floor, injuring himself in the process. The Grand Master then told him to go to the infirmary: by the time he reached it he was no longer bleeding, and the 2-1B surgical droid told him to leave as the cut would heal on its own. It was then Dume saw Depa Billaba when she was recovering in a bacta tank and felt a connection with her. Just as he left, Billaba awoke.[14]
            The next day, he underwent the trials and passed, much like Uzuma and Quid. He also attended a class by Madame Jocasta Nu on how Padawans were chosen by Jedi Knights, and Dume asked about how it came to be, much to Mace Windu's disapproval and Billaba's amusement.[14] On another occasion he attended a lecture by Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Jedi Temple's central security station learning about the Jedi recall signal, during which he inadvertently gave Kenobi the idea to use the beacon to warn Jedi away.[2] Later on, Billaba herself would instruct them on Form III.[14]
            After the lesson, Dume was hoping Billaba would choose him, and checked if she had a Padawan (she didn't) and asked his two peers what they thought about it; Quid told him that word had it she was "damaged goods" after her disastrous defeat[14] on Haruun Kal.[21] As he didn't know what to think, Dume went to Billaba and asked about what had happened to her, and she saw his choice as not political, but wise.[14] Before they could finish the conversation, Dume and Billaba then heard an intruder at the Temple, Rackham Sear, a Captain of Confederacy of Independent Systems who was setting bombs off at the Temple.[14] Dume was then saved by Billaba from the initial explosion. They then hid, for Billaba wanted more information about the situation, but despite her hesitation, Dume followed the attacker to the roof and attempted to stop him.[22]
            However, Sear subdued Dume and tried to kill him, but Billaba intervened and saved him. She also destroyed the timer with Sear's own bombs, prompting Sear to attack her in an escape attempt. However, when Sear saw that they would not let go of him, he committed suicide. Avoiding the explosion, Billaba then asked Dume to become her apprentice.[22] Before the end of the Clone Wars[1] Dume became Billaba's Padawan, and was taken by her to get a kyber crystal for his new lightsaber. Soon enough, Dume accompanied Billaba on her duty to lead the Grand Army of the Republic as General.[22]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kanan_Jarrus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKananJarrus</string></dict>
        <key>Bror Jace</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.748.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bror Jace was one of the original members of Rogue Squadron's second reformation, serving as Rogue Four for a brief time.
            A Thyferran native, Jace was a prominent member of Zaltin Corporation. His membership in the squadron was brought about by equal parts piloting skill and political concession. The New Republic wished to keep the bacta cartels happy and so put one person from each corporation on the squadron. Though dedicated to the New Republic cause, Bror was an arrogant man who was convinced that he was the most skilled of Rogue Squadron's new recruits. Throughout his time in the squadron, he found a rival and equal as a pilot in Corran Horn, whom Bror regarded as the only new pilot in the squadron who could truly compete with him. In the end, Bror won the rivalry with twenty-two kills to Corran’s twenty-one.
            After the Second Battle of Borleias, Bror received a message from home, saying that the family patriarch was dying. En route, however, his X-wing was pulled from hyperspace by the Imperial Interdictor cruiser Black Asp and destroyed. This, the rest of the squadron would later find out, was a ruse to bring him home to work with the Ashern rebels within Zaltin to plan a civil war against Xucphra, Zaltin’s rival, and Ysanne Isard.
            Jace rejoined Rogue Squadron to help bring down Isard and free his home planet. He flew with the squadron during its battle with the Lusankya. After the Rogue's victory at Thyferra, when Wedge Antilles and the rest of the squadron were making their choices on whether they were going to stay with the squadron, Jace chose to leave the squadron again to head the formation of a Thyferran Aerospace Defense Force.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bror_Jace</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBrorJace</string></dict>
        <key>Kai Justiss</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.749.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kai Justiss was a Human male who served as a Jedi Knight during the time surrounding the Clone Wars, and who managed to evade Order 66 and survive the Great Jedi Purge. In his early career as a Jedi, he encountered a wide variety of creatures in his travels, such as marsh haunts and muttamoks. He also worked with the Wookiees of Rwookrrorro, Kashyyyk to thwart a plot by droid specialist Turren Lonarr to destabilize Wookiee society. When the Clone Wars broke out in 22 BBY, Justiss participated in the first battle, which took place on Geonosis.
            He would later serve aboard the Acclamator-class assault ship VCD987, alongside fellow Jedi Tsui Choi and Sian Jeisel. In 22 BBY, the VCD987 was shipping troops to Drongar when it fell under attack from the Confederacy of Independent Systems. It was subsequently boarded, with Justiss and his companions at the mercy of Count Dooku, the Confederate leader. Dooku spared them, however, allowing Justiss to continue to serve the Galactic Republic. He was permanently assigned to Jedi diplomatic duties on Kashyyyk and was later the target of a bounty posted by enemy commander Asajj Ventress. When Order 66 was executed, Justiss was forced to flee from agents of the new Galactic Empire that had risen in the Republic's stead, and he was able to elude capture until 0 BBY, when he was captured by the Empire and executed by Darth Vader on board the first Death Star.
            Kai Justiss, a Jedi Knight, wielded a blue-bladed lightsaber. In his work as a Jedi, he encountered many different creatures on far-flung worlds. In several of these encounters, such as his meeting a Force-sensitive jakobeast in the Outer Rim Territories, he would have to draw his weapon in self-defense. Together with fellow Jedi Ur-Sema Du, he came across yet another Force-sensitive species called a marsh haunt. In one mission, when he used his Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor, his datapad was stolen by muttamoks, who were known to take any shining object that caught their attention.[5] When at the Jedi Temple, Justiss visited the Jedi Archives at least once during Jocasta Nu's tenure there.[6]
            At some stage in his early career, Justiss accompanied a Wookiee to his homeworld of Kashyyyk. Landing in Rwookrrorro, Justiss and his companion were greeted by the translator protocol droid K-27. As the trio began to venture further into the Wookiee city, they were met with the sight and sound of an explosion from a nearby building. As fires raged within the structure, K-27 urged Justiss and the Wookiee to attempt to save anyone inside. Just before Wookiee firefighters arrived, the Jedi and his companion were able to save some of the building's inhabitants.[7]
            One of the rescued Wookiees, Urrurrowo, explained that there had been flame beetles within the building for unknown reasons. K-27 mentioned that a similar blaze had torn through another part of Rwookrrorro a week prior and that the senior firefighter, Rruurrfhurra, had been hard-pressed to preserve one of the wroshyr limbs that the city rested on. Rruurrfhurra arrived shortly afterward; Justiss and his companion mentioned that they had seen some maintenance droids near the building just before the explosion. They then volunteered to help Rruurrfhurra hunt down the droids and discover just why the disaster had taken place. K-27, however, warned them that if they interfered with the droids, they would likely be fined and subsequently deported. Rruurrfhurra agreed, but accepted the help of the pair regardless.[7]
            In their investigations, Justiss, his companion, and Rruurrfhurra deduced that the flame beetles had been drawn to the walls of the building by what they had perceived to be a large concentration of their hatchlings. This information presented no answers as to how or if the maintenance droids had indeed started the blaze, leaving Justiss and his Wookiee companion with little to do but conclude their business on Kashyyyk. As the Wookiees dealt with the duo's cargo, they discovered the corpse of Rruurrfhurra in one of the containers. Justiss and his ally were subsequently taken into custody, where they explained over the course of several hours their whereabouts since the late firefighter had last been seen. The authorities eventually released the pair, but warned them not to depart Kashyyyk.[7]
            Upon returning to their ship, Justiss and his companion found the craft surrounded by JR-8 janitorial droids and flame beetles. After removing the threat of the beetles and droids, the pair inspected one of the JR-8s and found that it had come from Temporary Droids—the rental agency that had supplied the Wookiees with K-27. The protocol droid bristled at the suggestion that his master, Turren Lonarr, could have been involved with any of the recent blazes, but nevertheless informed Justiss that Lonarr had come to Kashyyyk from Dosha, and that he employed Trandoshans to guard his Temporary Droids warehouse.[7] Trandoshans, who hailed from a world that shared a system with Kashyyyk, had been engaged in a blood feud with the Wookiees for centuries.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kai_Justiss</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKaiJustiss</string></dict>

Prior to the Age of the Empire, he represented the office of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine at the homecoming of Poggle the Lesser on the planet Geonosis. Following the end of the Clone Wars and the birth of the New Order, Greejatus continued to serve Palpatine, now the Emperor of the galaxy. He presumably perished when the Death Star was destroyed by the Rebel Alliance.
            During the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic civil war between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Janus Greejatus served as an emissary of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. During the homecoming of Poggle the Lesser, Greejatus attended the ceremony—alongside several other dignitaries, including Ars Dangor, Sly Moore, Sate Pestage and Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic—which took place in the Petranaki arena, on the planet Geonosis.[4]
            Greejatus would go on to serve Palpatine as one of his closest advisers[1] after the latter's rise as Emperor of the Galactic Empire.[3] Grejatus walked around like a god on his homeworld.[5] Approximately five years into the Age of the Empire, he was serving in the ranks of the Imperial Ruling Council, a governing body which consisted of the Emperor's advisers who oversaw the daily management of the Empire.[3]
            In the years leading up to the Galactic Civil War, Greejatus and his colleague, Sim Aloo were tasked with collecting Sith artifacts from across the galaxy for their master. The Emperor heard rumors of an book of dark power guarded by monsters in a forest on the planet Ushruu and expressed interest in having it for himself. Greejatus hired a team of Trandoshans to retrieve the book from the Ushruu. However, the Trandoshans were eaten by the queen snarler, and Greejatus' plan failed.[6]
            In the year 4 ABY, Greejatus accompanied the Emperor aboard the second Death Star.[2] It was assumed that Greejatus was still aboard the Death Star when it exploded during the Battle of Endor, but his ultimate fate was unknown.[1]
            Janus Greejatus was a gaunt human male[1] of short stature, with brown hair and light skin.[2] He had a puffy face with dark, sunken eyes. Like the other members of the Imperial Ruling Council,[3] he wore baggy robes of garish color and floppy hats,[1] which were not unlike the garb of the Naboo noblemen.[3]
            Janus Greejatus first appeared as an unnamed Imperial advisor in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.[2] The character, who was portrayed by an uncredited background extra, went unnamed until the name "Janus Greejatus" was used in the Star Wars Legends Star Wars Customizable Card Game pack Death Star II Limited.[7] The name was then canonized with its inclusion in James Luceno's 2014 novel Tarkin.[3]
            Greejatus' costume was designed by Nilo Rodis-Jamero. Rodis-Jamero felt that the look of the Imperial advisors was one of the most exciting designs from Return of the Jedi and thought their design would need to convey an idea about the kind of world that the Emperor lived in. Rodis-Jamero based the look on that of Catholic bishops, with red coloring and ornate headpieces.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Janus_Greejatus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJanusGreejatus</string></dict>

            During the reign of the Galactic Empire, he once saw a cadet attempting to desert the local Imperial Academy, and he turned them in. However, after hearing the horrible choices Imperial cadets were forced to make, Janard decided never to repeat that mistake. Consequently, he helped the next fleeing cadet he saw, a girl named Sabine Wren. While Imperials pursued her, Janard knocked over a pack of freight containers to block their path, allowing Wren to escape. Thanks to that, the two became friends. Even after Wren joined the Spectres, a group of anti-Empire insurgents, Janard would sometimes give her intelligence on Imperial activity in the years that followed.[1]
            At some point in the fourth year before the Battle of Yavin, Janard was captured by the Imperials, who kept him prisoner aboard a Gozanti-class cruiser. However, the cruiser crashed in the waters of the planet Quila. While the ship sank, most of the Imperials on board were killed by monster eels, but Janard managed to take shelter in the front section of the vessel, the last part that would go underwater. Despite his efforts, Janard ended up being cornered by two surviving Imperial stormtroopers.[1]
            Fortunately for him, that moment coincided with the arrival of Sabine Wren and Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi Padawan, who had received the ship's distress call and had come to rescue him. As Janvard, Wren and Tano were about the embark the Spectres' starship, the Ghost, the commander of the sunken Gozanti made a sudden reappearance, announcing that an Imperial evac ship had arrived. While the Ghost got rid of the evac ship, Janard and his saviors fought the commander and his two soldiers. When it seemed that the Imperials were defeated, the rebels prepared to leave the sinking Gozanti and board the Ghost. However, a wounded stormtrooper still managed to shoot Janard in the back. The man died in the arms of his friend Sabine, expressing deep remorse for having turned in a cadet once, and encouraging the rebels to keep fighting.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Janard</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJanard</string></dict>

            Born on the planet of Onderon, Tigran Jamiro served at the Rebel Alliance military headquarters for much of the Galactic Civil War. Initially serving on Dantooine, he moved with the high command to Yavin 4, and was still based there when the Galactic Empire attacked the moon following the destruction of the first Death Star.
            He remained with the Rebellion, transferring to serve as Senior Logistics Officer at Echo Base on Hoth. In that position, all new personnel arrivals at the base reported to him. In 3 ABY when Han Solo prepared to leave the base with his Tauntaun to search for Luke Skywalker, who had recently went missing, Jamiro warned Solo that his Tauntaun would not make it very far before dying.
            By the time of the Yuuzhan Vong War, he had achieved the rank of general, and he led the New Republic forces that attacked Ylesia and apprehended Thrackan Sal-Solo and rogue Senator Pwoe. In Jamiro's command was Lilla Dade and his commandos and some pilots of the Twin Suns Squadron, including the Jedi Knights Jaina Solo and Lowbacca.
            The New Republic Forces quickly discovered Thrackan Sal-Solo, and former Senator Pwoe, as well as members of the Peace Brigade. The mission proceeded well, despite some minor delays, until the arrival of enemy reinforcements by space. Lowbacca and Jaina, who had felt the threat a few moments before, had made them hurry, but they needed all the coolness of General Jamiro, capacity of the Jedi Jaina and Lowie, and shooting accuracy of the Twin Suns Squadron, in order to make it out alive and leave with their prisoners.

        <key>Dern</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.758.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dern was a male Human serving as a Czerka Corporation patrol officer on Kashyyyk in 3956 BBY.
            Dern was Czerka Corporation officer on Kashyyyk who was poaching tach in the Shadowlands hoping to make a couple of years worth of profits. To poach the tach he would spray a person with a mist of tach essence, which caused the tach in the surrounding area to become enraged and attack them. He wanted the tach glands from near their brains to use in Tarisian ale. However, Jolee Bindo interfered with Dern's plans by sending Revan on a task to find a way to drive them away from their base near his home on Kashyyyk. He told Revan to find a peaceful solution so the Wookiees would not get in trouble with Czerka because of it. Revan managed to gloat out Dern's secret of how he managed to keep large predators from attacking his camp; by using sonic emitters. Revan then persuaded the guards of these emitters and was able to shut them down. This caused a terentatek to come, which drove Dern and his camp off. Whether or not they escaped is unknown.
            Dern was a money driven person, a trait common in many Czerka employees. He didn't care if he would make the tach population extinct as long it would make him a rich man. He also didn't have much concern about his guards or fellow employees, in fact he was not afraid to make an example out of anyone who would attempt to leave, and was known to kill anyone who would disobey orders. He wasn't someone who would make deals or be persuaded easily.
            In the game Knights of the Old Republic, the player can take an alternate option to do work for Dern by poaching the tach and earn credits, as well as dark side points.
            Other alternative options include threatening Dern to shut down his camp by killing everyone and manipulating the Czerka guards into abandoning their posts, after which Dern kills them.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dern</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDern</string></dict>

        <key>Jagi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.761.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jagi was a Human male Mandalorian that was a subordinate of Canderous Ordo before the outbreak of the Mandalorian Wars. In 3976 BBY, Jagi served under Ordo during the Mandalorian's capture of the planet Althir. During the battle, Jagi and his comrades were abandoned by Ordo while he sought a quick end to the engagement, which resulted in the deaths of Jagi's fellow Mandalorians. He swore to take his vengeance on Ordo for what he believed was the Mandalorian's cowardice.
            In 3956 BBY, the final year of the Jedi Civil War, Jagi encountered Ordo as the former was assisting the Jedi Padawan Revan in his search for the Star Forge, an ancient Rakatan superweapon that was fueling the Sith Empire's war effort. During the encounter, Jagi challenged Ordo to a duel in the Dune Sea on the planet Tatooine. Eventually, he and two thugs met Ordo and Revan near a broken sandcrawler owned by Czerka Corporation.
            While fighting a battle over the world of Althir, Ordo saw an opening in the Althiri fleet and decided to turn his attack force on the exposed area, leaving his other men and Jagi to die. Most of the Mandalorians under Jagi's command died and Jagi himself believed Ordo abandoned them all without good reason, though Ordo would later state that he did it to save the lives of more of his warriors.
            After having spent several years tracking his former commander, Jagi finally found him on one of the planets where there was a Star Map, and challenged him to a duel in the Dune Sea of Tatooine, threatening him to lose all honor in the eyes of Mandalorians. To ensure this, he claimed to have informed every surviving clan about what he was up to.
            Though he brought with him two Rodian thugs, Jagi waited for Ordo on Tatooine and the two of them met in the shade of a damaged Czerka Sandcrawler. Actually, thanks to Revan's intervention, Ordo was able to explain his behavior at the battle over Althir, making Jagi understand that his choice saved the lives of many Mandalorians, and moreover complied to Mandalore's teachings about opportunism and flexibility in combat.
            Realizing that he has been wrong to call Ordo's integrity into question, and that he had no other means to cleanse his after such accusations, he finally took his own life to die in honor. Afterwards, Revan and Ordo defeated the other two Rodian thugs. Ordo then realized that he was affected by this in more ways than he had anticipated, he thanked Revan for whatever his intentions were, and said that he needed time to think over what had just happened.
            Jagi was featured in the 2003 Xbox and PC video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, developed by BioWare. He was also mentioned in the official strategy guide for Knights of the Old Republic, where his name is spelled 'Jagy'. The character received an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.
            In the game, there are multiple paths the player can pursue in order to complete the sidequest centered on the character. If the player fails to convince Jagi to see Ordo's viewpoint, the character and his men attack and are killed. However, if the player attempts to use Force Persuasion to convince Jagi not to fight, Canderous will say he does not want the player to do so, and Jagi attacks anyway. Regardless of the action taken, Canderous will have the same response after the skirmish, and neither option affects the player's alignment.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jagi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJagi</string></dict>

His desire was to bring Alderaan back to peace, and end the Alderaan Civil War.
            Around 3643 BBY, Imperial Intelligence determined that somewhere on Alderaan was a major financial backer of "The Eagle," a terrorist leader who had sworn to bring down the Sith Empire and had been responsible for the apparent assassination of Darth Jadus, a member of the Dark Council. To that end, Imperial Intelligence dispatched their rising-star agent, codenamed Cipher Nine, to Alderaan to locate him. With the aid of Joiner emissary Vector Hyllus and—after initial hostility—of House Cortess, Cipher Nine was able to locate Ayl's records in the libraries of House Alde, and confirmed that he was indeed the man they were looking for.[1]
            Cipher Nine learned that Ayl himself was within the halls of House Rist, the feared Alderaanian assassins. Entering the secure wing of House Rist, Cipher Nine confronted Ayl, who believed that the Eagle's efforts to bring down the Empire would achieve the peace he sought on Alderaan. After a brief battle, Cipher Nine killed Ayl, whose last words were to condemn his killer for being blind to the necessity of his actions. It was later learned that Baroness Chay, lady of House Cortess, had also been an ally of the Eagle, and had sent him to House Rist to secure their aid in the Eagle's terrorist network. House Cortess would shortly after be wiped out at Cipher Nine's command.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Denri_Ayl</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDenriAyl</string></dict>

            A member of the royal family, Ramsis Dendup was born of Human parents on Onderon, a planet located in the Inner Rim region of the galaxy. At some point in his youth, Dendup ascended to the position of king. In 22 BBY, a political crisis that had been plaguing the galaxy for a decade degenerated into an open conflict known as the Clone Wars. While normally allied with the Republic, King Dendup believed in not entering the war. He regarded both sides as inherently corrupt and thought the best course of action for Onderon would be to remain unaligned. Yet at the beginning of the war, Dendup was overthrown by Sanjay Rash, who allied Onderon with the Separatists. Rash was not really the true king, but a puppet to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Saw Gerrera, a loyal follower of Dendup, would not tolerate Rash's Separatist-backed regime, which prompted him to join the Onderon rebels. Following a fierce but costly battle, the Separatists retreated after killing Rash and Dendup was restored as the true king. However, his reascention came at a great cost: Steela Gererra, the rebel leader, was killed while trying to protect him, despite the efforts of Padawan Ahsoka Tano to save her. Dendup repaid her sacrifice with a public announcement and funeral, stating that her death would be remembered as the day Onderon became free again.
            Ramsis Dendup was a patriotic Onderonian who fought to liberate his people during the Separatist invasion of Onderon.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ramsis_Dendup/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRamsisDendup</string></dict>

        <key>Dace Golliard</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.767.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dace Golliard was a Human male who served the Galactic Republic as a naval officer during the Great Sith War. He later became a member of The Crucible slavery organization. Golliard was the Fleet Captain of the Gladiator.
            During the Great Sith War, the Human male Dace Golliard served as an officer in the Galactic Republic's Navy.[2] When Sith forces under the Sith Lord Ulic Qel-Droma attacked the shipyards at the planet Foerost,[3] Golliard fled the battle.[4] Eventually, he was recaptured and was set to be court-martialed. However, Sith forces attacked the ship transporting Golliard, leaving him in the ship's brig. Members of The Crucible slavery organization enslaved the survivors of the Sith's attack on the ship, taking Golliard and the survivors to the Crucible's dueling pits. Golliard killed all of his former crew members in the dueling pits. He advanced in the Crucible's ranks, leading raids on various planets to find more slaves. Golliard eventually became the captain[5] of the warship Gladiator.[2]
            During Golliard's time with the Crucible, he dealt with Antos Wyrick, the professor of the New Generation Academy on Osadia. Wyrick bargained with Golliard and the Crucible for more Arkanian offshoot families for his biological experiments.[5][6] At some point, Wyrick gave Golliard his daughter, Chantique,[4] to enslave in exchange for a shipment of offshoot families.[5] Golliard eventually led a raid against Wyrick's school and captured his students[2] while the professor was away on a trip.[6] He captured the female Arkanian offshoot Edessa, who had fled Wyrick's academy during the attack.[2]
            In 3963 BBY, Captain Golliard responded to a distress call from Sariyah Budan, leader of the Sungrazer cooperative, a client of the Crucible located in the Koornacht Cluster. Two beings, Zayne Carrick and Jarael had posed as Crucible agents in order to infiltrate the cooperative and free the slave miners that worked the comets.[1] Golliard immediately recognized Jarael as a young child he had captured many years earlier. He ordered his skyreaper drones to attack the Hot Prospect, the mining ship that the slaves were being taken to. As Golliard ordered a boarding party to attack the ship, the Hot Prospect fired its mining drill into the bridge of the Gladiator, causing it to decompress. The warship suffered further damage when it was hit by mining explosives launched by Mandalorian renegade Rohlan Dyre. Golliard ordered the surviving sky reapers to attack the mining ship, but Carrick shut off the Hot Prospect's centrifuge, sending into a spin that tore it away and enabled it to jump to hyperspace. Golliard was severely punished by Chantique for his failure to apprehend Jarael and Carrick but his life was spared by Bar'injar who still required his knowledge.[2]
            Golliard later found Carrick adrift in an Aurek-class fighter, under the alias of Carth Kamlin, a Republic officer escorting the Vindication. Golliard could tell that the fighter was salvage and discovered a homing beacon in it, immediately putting the Crucible on Carrick's plot.[5]
            After the Crucible fled from Volgax, Golliard went into hiding. Soon, however, Zayne Carrick realized that Golliard knew the location of Osadia, and became determined to track him down and retrieve the information so that he could save Jarael. Carrick called in his debt with Cassus Fett, who staged an attack in order to lure Admiral Saul Karath to a mining facility near the Ithor System. At the same time he released a signal out announcing his intent. Golliard swallowed the bait and moved the ship behind some asteroids in order to capture any survivors as slaves. The Mandalorians suddenly fled, and Zayne contacted Admiral Karath, informing him of Golliard's presence nearby. Since he still nursed a grudge against Golliard for causing his father's death, Karath was all too eager to help bring Golliard down. The Gladiator was disabled and brought aboard with a tractor beam. In a last ditch effort, Golliard used an escape pod to flee to the surface hoping to find a shuttle offworld. However, Carrick used the Skyreaper control panel aboard the Gladiator to release the drones; the drones then proceeded to capture Golliard and bring him to the Swiftsure. Golliard was brought before Admiral Karath, who taunted him before having Golliard taken away to be court-martialed.
            Golliard was very proud of his status as Fleet Captain; he expected his commands to be obeyed to the letter and frequently threatened his subordinates with death if they displeased him. This was at odds with his previous behavior in the Great Sith War, as he was court-martialed by the Republic Navy. Despite his arrogance, Golliard had no desire to ascend in rank since he preferred to see front line action. He was knowledgeable about naval combat and was quick to spot weaknesses in his enemies' tactics. Golliard was nevertheless tricked by the Hot Prospect's unorthodox tactics. He, however, accepted responsibility for his failures, even when faced with death.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dace_Golliard</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDaceGolliard</string></dict>

            Daykim was employed by the Corusca Bank (Imperial Palace branch), as a low-level manager. Due to a simple accounting error by a member of his staff, he became the most famous person on Coruscant for two hours. The error caused Emperor Palpatine to be placed at the top of the public list of loan-defaulters in the Imperial City for two hours. In retribution for this embarrassment, the Emperor fired the entire board of directors and sought out the one personally responsible for the error. Daykim, along with his fellow bureaucrats, fled into the depths of Coruscant's Undercity to avoid capture.

By the time of the Cold War, a period of unrest between Empire and the Galactic Republic, he had proven to be one of the strongest Sith Lords and ascended to the title of Darth. He had also successfully trained his apprentice Hargrev and brought him to lordship.
            Silthar often worked with the Imperial Reclamation Service captain Barden Golah. During their time together, he found a lost temple on Ziost and the crystal caves of Molavar. Around 3643 BBY on Tatooine, he led the investigation into the secrets of the long abandoned Czerka Arms base.

Sparing Silthar before destroying the Sand People mural (thus leaving him to succumb to his injuries) is the light side option; the player may also choose the dark side option and kill Silthar themselves, then destroy the mural.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Silthar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthSilthar</string></dict>
        <key>Roblio Darté</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.772.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Roblio Darté was a male Human Jedi Master and Jedi General who fought in the Clone Wars. He was noted for his skilled use of the crossguard lightsaber. Though he survived Order 66, he was killed during the Conclave on Kessel by Darth Vader.
            A Force-sensitive Human male, Roblio Darté was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order, ascending to the rank of Jedi Knight after completing his Trials of Knighthood. Proficient with a lightsaber, Darté crafted for himself a rarely seen crossguard variant with two blue blades. After further service to the Galactic Republic, Darté was promoted to Jedi Master by the Jedi High Council.[3]
            In 22 BBY, when the Separatist Crisis between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems erupted into the Clone Wars, Darté took up the rank of General in the Grand Army of the Republic, leading clone troopers against the Separatist Droid Army. In 21 BBY, he was sent to the swampy battlefields of Parcellus Minor. Due to the unstable surface of the planet, the Republic was unable to land any of their heavy equipment, and Darté and his troops found themselves fighting without transport or artillery. Worse yet, Republic Intelligence vastly underestimated the number of Separatist forces on the planet, and Darté found his forces outnumbered ten to one. Completing the disaster, a CIS fleet arrived behind the small Republic fleet, trapping both the orbital support ships and the army planetside.
            Despite being wildly outnumbered, Darté and his clones held off the droid army for some time, while suffering heavy casualties in the process. Finally, the Separatist commander tired of the fight and ordered an orbital bombardment of the planet. As the Separatist turbolasers bombarded the world, decimating Republic troops and Separatist droids alike, the tzeotine created by the native flora ignited, setting the entire planet aflame. Darté ordered his forces into a full retreat; attempting to save as many clones as possible, he was forced to leave large numbers of wounded troopers behind. Darté himself was wounded numerous times, and lost his left eye. In the end, over 90% of the clone troopers involved in the battle were killed, and it was later described by some as being close to a second Battle of Jabiim.
            Two days after the evacuation, Darté reported back to Coruscant to report the disaster to the High Council. Within the High Council Chamber, the bandaged and scarred Darté knelt before the twelve Masters as he recounted the events. During his report, Senators Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and Ask Aak entered to listen, as the truth of the report had was largely downplayed by the media and the Galactic Senate. Senator Aak stormed out of the chamber, blaming the Jedi for the destruction of another world.[2]
            In 19 BBY, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Republic—secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith—issued Contingency Order 66 to the Grand Army, commanding them to execute their Jedi Generals. Somehow, Darté survived the slaughter and went to ground, avoiding detection by the newly formed Galactic Empire. In the months following the downfall of the Order and the Republic, Darté was contacted by fellow Master Shadday Potkin, who wished to conduct a conclave with other survivors. Assembling in an abandoned mine on Kessel, Darté and his compatriots discussed the future of the Order and the next course of action they should pursue. Their opinions covered a wide range; while Masters Bultar Swan and Tsui Choi argued against outright attacks against the Sith or the Empire, Koffi Arana offered the possibility that any action, even succumbing to the dark side of the Force, was worth the risk if they could take down the Sith. Darté and Ma'kis'shaalas landed in the middle of the argument, and Darté believed that justice needed to be served and the Republic revived.[1]
            Master Potkin revealed that their arguments were a moot point, as she had assumed that they would discuss their options without acting, and thusly, she had chosen their course for them—the conclave was in fact a trap she had set to lure Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader to his death. She had known that Vader was searching for Obi-Wan Kenobi, and so she leaked false information that he would be attending the conclave. Her goal was to weaken the Emperor and the New Order while simultaneously letting the galaxy know that the Jedi still lived. As Choi reeled in shock over her decision, Potkin sensed Vader's arrival in the Force and urged the others to ready themselves.
            As the Sith Lord entered the chamber, demanding Kenobi, Darté and most of the Jedi attacked. Sia-Lan Wezz rushed ahead of the others and was stabbed through the chest by Vader. Darté, Arana, and Ma'kis circled Vader, but the Dark Lord pushed Arana across the chamber and sliced through Ma'kis's chest, killing him. Farr managed to wound Vader with a strike to the back, but Vader leaped away, followed by Potkin. Potkin had brought a cortosis blade to the battle, thinking it would give her the edge she needed to defeat Vader. She succeeded in deactivating his lightsaber, but Vader simply tossed the weapon aside and lifted Potkin with the Force and snapped her neck, then took her blade for himself. Darté, Farr, and Arana all attacked Vader again, but just as quickly had their lightsabers deactivated as well. Choi wisely jumped in and saved the others by severing Vader's hand while Swan slashed him along the leg, staggering him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Roblio_Dart%C3%A9</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRoblioDarte</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Decimus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.773.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Decimus was a Human male who served as Dark Lord of the Sith of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Cold War and the Galactic War.
            Decimus ascended to the Dark Council in the last months of the Great Galactic War when a Jedi Strike Team killed the Dark Councilor Darth Azamin in his secret stronghold and after, all Jedi of the team died on the ship they used to escape, which exploded due to a mechanical malfunction, probably sabotage. There were rumors that Decimus sold information to the Jedi in order to kill his rival, but these suspicions were never proven.
            Decimus was chosen to lead the Imperial invasion of Corellia and conceived a plan that permitted the Empire to take control of the world with no significant resistance. The Imperial army under his command annihilated most of the Green Jedi. Unfortunately at the Galactic War the Republic attacked and recaptured Corellia and in the fighting Decimus was killed in the Speaker's Garden of the Corellian Legislature Building.
            Decimus was known for his brilliant military strategies and ability to exploit any situation for his own uses. Despite his wanton ambition, Decimus was fiercely loyal to the Sith Emperor.
            Darth Decimus used a single-bladed Sith lightsaber, and his combat abilities as a Sith Warrior were considered notable, alongside premier Sith such as Darth Malgus and even, Darth Marr.
            Decimus's dialogue, particularly his introductory dialogue, changes depending on the player's class, usually offering to support the player against the final antagonist of their class storyline.
            During the Quest "The Battle of Corellia"; at the end after killing Master Ramos, Darth Decimus contacts the Hero of the day and Darbin Sull over holofrequency. In the holo he appears to have yellow, and orange eyes yet in person he has red eyes.
            Decimus is voiced by Welsh actor Mark Lewis Jones who also portrayed Captain Moden Canady in Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Decimus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthDecimus</string></dict>

He became the world's first king when he brought peace to the other warring noble houses to form the Alderaanian Parliament. 
            Darrus Alde[1] was a Human[2] male who served as the head of House Alde on the planet Alderaan, centuries after[1] the planet was colonized by Humans around 27,500 BBY.[3] When the other warring noble families gathered for a battle at a canyon east of the Juran Mountains, Alde prevented the fighting by parleying with the various houses and convincing them to end their rivalries.[1]
            Under Alde's leadership, the building known as the Elysium was constructed in the Glarus Valley to house the newly-formed Alderaanian Parliament, and he was elected by the Parliament at the Elysium to serve as the first King of Alderaan.[1] The canyon was named after Alde,[4] as was the King's Road that led from the King's Pass to the Alde estate.[1] His descendants in House Alde later prided themselves on their purity of their lineage,[4] displaying a hologram of the king in their estate and keeping a statue of Darrus in the House Alde Royal Museum.[5]
            Darrus Alde was first mentioned in the Codex entries for King's Pass and House Alde in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game released by BioWare and LucasArts[1][4] on December 20, 2011.[6] He is represented in statues and holograms in House Alde's estate.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darrus_Alde</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarrusAlde</string></dict>
        <key>Darovit</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.777.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darovit, also known as Tomcat, was a failed Human Jedi Padawan and failed Sith during the last battles of the New Sith Wars. He was also the cousin of Hardin and the Sith Lord Darth Zannah.
            The Jedi scout Torr Snapit discovered Darovit on Somov Rit along with his cousins, Hardin (known as Bug) and Zannah (known as Rain). He was allowed to join in the war between the Army of Light and Brotherhood of Darkness by their cousin and guardian, Root.[1]
            On the way to the Army of Light base on Ruusan, the starship flown by Torr Snapit was brought down in the forest. Snapit allowed the children to cross a rope bridge to safety, then sliced it with his lightsaber. After the Sith and Torr had fallen down the canyon, Darovit climbed down to retrieve Torr's lightsaber and found him alive. Although Torr pleaded for him to leave it, Darovit left him dismayed as he took it anyway and rejoined his cousin.[1]
            The ragged remnants of the Army of Light and the brutal reality of the war failed to fit in with the youth's expectations of what being a Jedi would be like. He betrayed the Jedi, murdered General Kiel Charny and joined the Sith as a pupil of Dark Lady Githany. At the end of the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, he turned his back on the dark when he proved unable to kill Hardin.[1]
            However, no sooner had he made his decision when he became powerless to prevent either his mentor or his cousin from being killed by Lord Kaan's thought bomb. He was one of the few survivors of the thought bomb, although he had no idea how he managed it. In reality, it was because his connection to the Force was very weak, especially after Rain left. It was later revealed that the only reason Darovit ever had any power was because of his Force bond with Rain.[1]
            After the thought bomb, he was drawn to the nexus of trapped souls it had created. There, he encountered Rain (now using her real name Zannah) and her Master Darth Bane. Believing Bane to be about to kill them both, Darovit drew his lightsaber against him. Zannah drew on the dark side, exploding the hand Darovit was holding the lightsaber with, to allow Bane to spare his life - her last act of mercy before becoming a true Sith.[1][2]
            Darovit remained on Ruusan, where he was befriended by the Bouncers, who taught him herbal lore which he used to treat resident humans, who dubbed him "the Healing Hermit."[1][2] After years wandering, he finally built a simple hut in the boreal forests in 996 BBY. When Johun Othone was overseeing the creation of the Jedi memorial on Ruusan in 990 BBY, Darovit was enraged and constantly sabotaged the construction. He was later caught by Othone, and the Jedi convinced Darovit to come to Coruscant and let everyone know of the Sith Lords, Bane and Zannah, that he'd seen.[2]
            Before he could testify and let his story be known, however, Darovit found Zannah, who was disguised as a Jedi, in the Jedi Archives. Fearing that she'd be discovered, Zannah took Darovit with her aboard the Loranda to Tython. There, Darovit was instructed to hide in the closet inside of Belia Darzu's castle, as the Sith Lords engaged in a duel against the pursuing Jedi.[2]
            Following the aftermath of the duel, Darovit was instructed by Zannah to take the holocron of Belia Darzu and the five lightsabers from the Jedi with him to the Loranda.[2]
            Darovit accompanied Darth Zannah to Ambria, where they confronted Caleb, to heal Darth Bane. When Caleb refused to heal him unless Zannah sent a message to the Jedi, revealing his presence to them, Darovit suggested that Zannah make a deal with him. He thought that Zannah should message the Jedi to let them know of Bane, and that her Master would be arrested, and she could be redeemed. Zannah refused, knowing that Darovit was trying to get her to turn away from the dark side, but Darovit told her it was the only way Caleb would heal Bane, and eventually she agreed.[2]
            After Caleb healed Bane, Zannah murdered him and used her sorcery to drive Darovit insane. When the Jedi arrived, Zannah had hidden herself and her Master in Caleb's hut in a hidden trap door under a blanket. Meanwhile, Darovit, driven mad by illusions, attacked the Jedi with Valenthyne Farfalla's lightsaber, and was cut down immediately. Since the Jedi believed he was the Sith Lord that Caleb had spoken of, they investigated no further into the matter, and returned to Coruscant with Caleb's remains, never finding Zannah and Bane.[2]
            Darovit was a moderately powerful Force user. After interacting with Darth Bane and his cousin Zannah at the thought bomb site his hand was exploded, but due to his isolation from the galactic society he never was able to get a cybernetic to replace it. Even though he had very little formal training he was still fairly competent. He was able to kill a handful of Jedi soldiers but since a majority of the Army of Light was built up of mostly teenage force sensitives with only a month or so of training, this was not a great display of skill. However, it still showed Darovit was capable in the field of battle. It was made clear, however, that he was no match for the Sith'ari Darth Bane, and when he fought the Jedi on Ambria, he was cut down quickly, though this was likely due to his mind having just been broken by Zannah. He was stated to be a good hunter and skilled basic weapon and stick combat.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darovit</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarovit</string></dict>

        <key>Joclad Danva</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.779.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Joclad Danva was a male Human Jedi Knight serving the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the final years of the Republic Classic era. A master of the fighting technique called Teräs Käsi, Danva fought and died in the opening battle of the Clone Wars.
            Discovered to be Force-sensitive early in his childhood, Danva was taken to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training in the ways of the Force. Eventually graduating from the academy there, Danva was selected by a Jedi Master to become a Padawan and travel the galaxy studying the ways of the Jedi through active duty. Eventually passing his Trials of Knighthood, Danva was knighted and began his independent studies down the path of the Jedi Guardian. This further research led him to become a master of the martial arts form known as Teräs Käsi, a highly physical form of fighting.[2] Combining this with his prowess in Form VI of lightsaber combat, Danva was a formidable opponent in a fight.[1]
            Often traveling to Bunduki to participate in the Teräs Käsi matches held there annually, Danva refrained from using the Force against his opponents as he believed that gave him an unfair advantage. During the 22 BBY match between Danva and non-Force-sensitive Phow Ji, Danva was outmatched and defeated by Ji, who took the victory as proof that the Force did not exist.[2][4] Returning to the Jedi Temple after the competition, Danva was summoned by Master of the Order Mace Windu to join a massive Jedi strike team that was headed for Geonosis. Joining his fellow Jedi, Danva flew out to Geonosis and set his starfighter down in the dusty plains of the world, before marching into the Petranaki arena where Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Senator Padmé Amidala were being prepared for execution by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Following Windu's cue, Danva and the other Jedi spread throughout the arena ignited their lightsabers and began cutting down the hordes of battle droids filling the arena. After a great battle on the arena floor, Danva and the twenty-some Jedi left standing received an ultimatum from Confederacy leader Count Dooku: surrender and join him, or die. Choosing to take their chances with the battle droids, the Jedi prepared to fight to the death when Grand Master Yoda arrived with the Grand Army of the Republic. Danva had the chance to reach a ship and escape the arena, but died whilst attempting to escape. [1]
            Joclad Danva was known for his fighting prowess, both armed with two lightsabers and with his bare hands. He was an extremely skilled practitioner of Niman, considered to be one of the most powerful duelists in the Jedi Order, and was a highly proficient Teräs Käsi martial artist.[1][2][4]
            Joclad Danva was portrayed by Kyle Rowling, the partial dueling and stunt double for Christopher Lee (Count Dooku) and Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu) in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Joclad_Danva</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJocladDanva</string></dict>
        <key>Dyer</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.780.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dyer was a male human who served the Galactic Empire as a Colonel during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. When the Empire began construction of a second Death Star in orbit of the moon Endor,[1] Dyer was stationed on the moon's surface as the commander[2] of the Death Star's shield generator bunker, with Commander Igar and Major Hewex serving under him. When the Alliance began their attack on the incomplete Death Star in the Battle of Endor, a squad was sent to the surface of Endor and successfully infiltrated the bunker in order to destroy it. Dyer and a group of Imperials then confronted the Rebels as they attempted to set explosive charges inside the bunker, but the Rebel General Han Solo hurled a toolbox of explosives at the Colonel, knocking him over a railing and down into the generator room below. The Rebels were ultimately successful in destroying the generator and then the Death Star II itself. Dyer had brown hair and eyes and fair skin.[1]
            Colonel Dyer appeared for the first time in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi where he was portrayed uncredited[1] by Ben Burtt, who also worked as the film's sound designer.[3] The character's name was confirmed to be canon by the reference book Ultimate Star Wars, which was released in 2015.[4]
            Dyer was a late addition to the film; his character wasn't created in the original revised third draft of Return of the Jedi nor in Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays.[5][6] In the script, both Dyer's and Lieutenant Renz's lines were merged and the person who shouts "Freeze! You Rebel Scum" was identified simply as "Commander".[5] However, in the latter, Renz was identified as "Commander" while Dyer was named "Imperial officer".[6]
            Actor Barrie Holland, who portrayed Renz in the film, recalled that shooting the scene that featured the characters Dyer and Renz was difficult due director Richard Marquand having conflicting views with his assistant director and first cameraman. Shooting the scene took "several beats" in order to get it right, and Holland believed that a stuntman played Dyer before finding out that the character was played by Ben Burtt.[7]
            In the 2004 DVD release of Return of the Jedi, Burtt commented about his cameo as Dyer in the audio commentary.[3] The scream that Dyer makes when he is knocked off the catwalk into the generator room was meant to be an attempt at replicating the Wilhelm scream, which Burtt has attempted to include in all of the films on which he has worked.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dyer</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDyer</string></dict>

However, he was killed during the first escape attempt when his TIE fighter was destroyed by Captain Vult Skerris.
            Rake Gahree was born to a mother and a father, and had a brother.[2]
            Rake Gahree was an Imperial cadet at the Skystrike Academy, which trained TIE fighter pilots. He was friends with Wedge Antilles and Hobbie. Two years before the Battle of Yavin, Gahree and his friends became disillusioned with the Galactic Empire after the Imperials began destroying unarmed rebel ships that had surrendered. They sent a message to Phoenix Cell that was picked up by the rebel agent Fulcrum. Fulcrum contacted the Phoenix Cell who dispatched the former Imperial cadet and Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren to extract them.[1]
            After Governor Arihnda Pryce and Agent Kallus arrived to investigate the presence of defectors at the Academy, Gahree and his two friends talked about the risks involved in their escape attempt. Later, Wren met up with Antilles and told him that she had come to rescue him and his friends. An opportunity to escape arose when Governor Pryce and Instructor Goran dispatched all of the cadets on a mock battle exercise. However, this was a trap devised by Pryce to lure the defectors out of hiding. At Wren's direction, the defecting cadets flew their TIE fighters towards a rebel CR90 corvette.[1]
            However, Pryce deactivated the TIE's solar collector panels, leaving the pilots stranded in space. A flight of TIE interceptors led by Captain Vult Skerris then attacked the rebel corvette. Under Pryce's orders, Skerris fired a salvo at one of the cadets' TIE fighters; hitting Gahree's craft. Gahree was killed while his friends and Wren watched. Despite his death, his friends and Wren made a second successful escape attempt.[1]
            Rake Gahree was a young pilot who joined the Skystrike Academy, which trained starfighter pilots for the Empire. He was friends with Antilles and Hobbie and shared their disillusionment with the Empire's increasingly ruthless policies. This led them to make an escape attempt which led to Gahree's death.[1]
            Rake Gahree first appeared as a supporting character in the Star Wars Rebels episode "The Antilles Extraction," which first premiered on Disney XD on October 8, 2016 where he was voiced by Corey Burton who also voiced Instructor Goran.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rake_Gahree</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRakeGahree</string></dict>

He would often go running on the Dantooine plains, as he didn't like using speeders. However, he was known to rent a speeder between Calder Nettic and himself. In retaliation for his wife cheating on him with Nettic, Guld murdered Nettic on the plains of Dantooine.
            The earliest recorded history regarding Handon Guld is that he once rented a speeder with Calder Nettic. In spite of this, Guld felt Nettic was an unethical and unpopular man on Dantooine.
            In 3956 BBY, Guld discovered that his wife was cheating on him with Nettic. Enraged, he planned to kill Nettic. On one particular day, he found Nettic on the Dantooine plains and killed him with a single shot to the man's torso. Shortly after, Guld was accidentally shot in the hip by Rickard Lusoff, who was also trying to murder Calder for cheating him in a business deal at Garang Spacesport. The attack caused Guld to drop his blaster and he activated his emergency beacon to request help from the nearby Jedi Enclave, hoping that the scene would appear as if Rickard was the murderer. The Jedi Bolook was dispatched to the scene a few hours later and began investigating, though he appeared to be stumped.
            As fate, or the Force, would have it, an amnesiac Revan, a former Jedi Knight turned Dark Lord of the Sith until he lost his memories, arrived during his re-training as a Jedi Padawan. With Bolook's guidance, Revan began investigating the case himself, questioning both Guld and Lusoff, as well as gaining information from an information retrieval droid Bolook had brought along. Guld initially told Revan he had been out running that day, a hobby he did very often as he couldn't stand using speeders. He also said that he hardly knew Nettic, though Revan soon discovered the pair rented a speeder together.
            Further investigation revealed to Revan the affair between Guld's wife and Nettic. When questioning Guld about this affair as a motive for murder, Guld repeatedly denied any involvement and claimed he had been out running to clear his head for the divorce proceedings. Later, Revan asked Guld about the blaster found near Nettic's body, which Guld promptly claimed had been stolen from his house a week before. Revan finished his investigation by concluding that Guld lied about his blaster being stolen, and both he and Bolook discovered Guld's hip wound from Lusoff's blaster shot. Revan and Bolook agreed that Guld was indeed the murderer of Calder Nettic and he was immediately placed under arrest. However, Lusoff was also arrested for attempted murder on Nettic, as well as aggravated assault and attempted murder on Guld.
            Handon's line of "And I would've got away with it if it wasn't for you meddling Jedi" is a reference to Scooby-Doo. When the villain was captured on the show, he or she would often say, "And I would've gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids!" This was likely an in-joke, as Handon appears to be voiced by Frank Welker, one of the show's original voice actors.[source?]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Handon_Guld</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHandonGuld</string></dict>
        <key>Gantoris</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.786.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gantoris was a Human male native to the planet of Eol Sha. He was a Force-sensitive and was believed by Luke Skywalker to be a descendant of Ta'ania, herself the daughter of a Jedi Knight who exiled herself to the isolated world. Gantoris used his fledgling abilities to protect the people of the volcanic planet, and was eventually made the leader of their forgotten colony.
            In 11 ABY, Skywalker journeyed to Eol Sha as part of his search for Jedi offspring and other Force-sensitives. New Republic reports had indicated that the leader of Eol Sha could predict earthquakes, an ability Skywalker hoped was latent Force-sensitivity. Upon his arrival, he was brought before the planet's leader by one of the colonists, Warton. Gantoris mistrusted the black-robed Jedi Master, believing him to be a "Dark Man" who had plagued his nightmares for many years. He believed that the "Dark Man" would teach him unimaginable powers and then destroy him. Because of this premonition, Gantoris made Skywalker face tests of his powers to prove himself before accepting Skywalker was whom he claimed to be. He then became the first student Skywalker recruited to join his Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4.
            There, the ambitious trainee was frustrated by Skywalker's individualistic and unorthodox training methods. Gantoris was visited more frequently by the "Dark Man," who was in fact the spirit of the Sith Lord Exar Kun. He accepted training from Kun, who had entrapped his spirit within the Massassi temples on Yavin 4. Eventually, Gantoris fashioned his own lightsaber, responding to Kun's subtle guidance through the Force, yet he was unaware that Kun was actually attempting to turn Gantoris to the dark side. When Gantoris finally realized this and tried to reject Kun, the specter incinerated him, making him the first student to die at the Praxeum.
            Gantoris was born into the sole settlement of the isolated volcanic world Eol Sha. His affinity with the Force first became apparent when he survived an avalanche as a child: while his companions were crushed by falling rock mere feet from him, Gantoris instinctively shielded himself using the Force to survive the onslaught of rock. His latent Force-sensitivity benefited the colony in many ways, such as by accurately predicting earthquakes, eruptions, and avalanches. These warnings proved invaluable on the unstable planet, where ordinary activities such as food gathering were fraught with danger; whether it was hunting bugdillos with spears or gathering lichen from within dormant geysers, mortality frequently confronted the colonists. Gantoris' abilities, combined with his tough attitude and charismatic leadership, led to him becoming the leader of the surviving colonists; however, his Force-sensitivity also gave him repeated dreams of a "Dark Man"—someone who would promise him great power before ultimately destroying him.[3][4]
            In 9 ABY, Eol Sha was rediscovered by a New Republic sociologist, who briefly visited the planet. Within his report recommending the immediate evacuation of the planet, the sociologist mentioned the unusual abilities ascribed to Gantoris by his fellow colonists. Although his report was soon lost within the growing Republic bureaucracy, and his recommendation never formally acted on, it was later noticed by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Piecing this report together with information that a woman named Ta'ania, an illegitimate daughter of a Jedi Knight, was one of the original colonists around 89 BBY, Skywalker traveled to Eol Sha in 11 ABY. He was searching for Force-sensitive individuals to train at his new Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. At the time Skywalker landed on the planet, Gantoris and many of the colonists were attempting to rescue two children that had been caught in an avalanche; a driven man, Gantoris worked with a fervor that outstripped his companions. Skywalker was brought to Gantoris by the colonist Warton and the Jedi Master immediately began aiding the colonists' efforts by moving large heavy boulders with the Force. Eventually, the workers discovered the two children; one crushed to death by the rocks and the other heavily injured. In the heat of the moment, Gantoris reacted angrily to Skywalker's presence, associating his black robes and powerful abilities with the "Dark Man" who had haunted his sleep. His fellow colonists also reacted with suspicion at this stranger whose arrival had coincided with the death of one of their own. The Jedi Master tried to explain the purpose of his trip, and offered to prove his good intentions in whatever way Gantoris found appropriate. While the Eol Sha leader himself carried the broken body of the dead boy back to their village, he ordered Skywalker separated from the colonists and kept in a dilapidated storage module. In an attempt to keep the Jedi off-balance, Gantoris informed him the shelter had been the dead child's favorite play spot.[3]
            Gantoris resolved to test Skywalker's abilities with two challenges, to see if the young Jedi could wield the powers to support his claim. First, Gantoris led him into a geyser tunnel, ostensibly to collect lichen. On the way to the geyser, Skywalker noticed that although Gantoris moved with poise and confidence, his feelings were uncertain, unsure of whether to trust the strange arrival. He tried to sway Gantoris with safety for his people, promising them a paradise world given the eventual doom of their current world—the moon of Eol Sha was being pulled towards the planet that would result in a collision within a few hundred years— but Gantoris was unconvinced. After luring Skywalker deep into the geyser the suspicious leader covertly exited the column, waiting to see if Skywalker could survive an imminent eruption. Sensing the rising heat and the pressure below, Skywalker tried to climb out, but eventually had to use a Force Jump to escape. For the second test, Gantoris made him cross a lava pit and confront the deadly fireworm within. Upon seeing the fireworm, Skywalker used his lightsaber to puncture a hole in the creature's metallic armor, and the lava seeped in, killing it from the inside out, and exploding it when the lava reached the fireworm's air bladders. Since Skywalker succeeded in passing both challenges, Gantoris agreed to follow him off Eol Sha, and Skywalker promised him the other inhabitants of the hostile world be relocated by the New Republic.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gantoris</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGantoris</string></dict>

        <key>Myles Grint</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.788.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Myles Grint was a human male who served the Galactic Empire fourteen years after the end of the Clone Wars. Along with Cumberlayne Aresko, Grint was the taskmaster and one of the commanding officers of Lothal, stationed in Capital City. Together, the two managed Imperial military operations on the planet and trained cadets at the Academy for Young Imperials on Lothal.[3]
            Grint, along with Aresko, attempted to eliminate the rebel crew of the Ghost on numerous occasions. Due to their multiple failures, both officers were executed by the Grand Inquisitor, on the orders of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin.[2]
            Myles Grint was an Imperial commanding officer who was based at the Imperial Academy on Lothal. He held the rank of taskmaster and served as an aide to the Academy's Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko. A few years prior to the Battle of Yavin, Myles and his superior Aresko attended a party to celebrate the acceptance of Dhara Leonis to the Imperial Academy. Dhara's parents Leo and Tepha Leonis were agricultural scientists who worked for the Ministry of Agriculture and had recently relocated to Lothal a month ago. Other Imperial dignitaries present at that function included Governor Arihnda Pryce, Supply Master Yogar Lyste, and Lieutenant Piers Roddance. Later that year, Cadet Leonis mysteriously disappearance with the Imperial authorities reporting that she had ran away.[4]
            Following the acceptance of Dhara's younger brother Zare Leonis's application to study at the Imperial Academy, Myles and Aresko attended Zare's farewell party. In contrast to his sister's party, Zare's party was a somber affair due to his family's difficult circumstances. During the party, Myles and Aresko monopolized the trays of dainties that the Leonises' nanny droid Auntie Nags brought for the guests. Other Imperial dignitaries included Governor Pryce who saluted the family for their devotion to the Empire and promised to continue the search for their missing daughter. Unknown to Myles and the other Imperial guests, Zare had planned to infiltrate the Imperial Academy in order to find Dhara and to aid the growing resistance against the Galactic Empire.[4]
            Later that year, Taskmaster Grint and Commandant Aresko participated in the arrest of the corrupt Imperial Security Bureau lieutenant Jenkes, who had murdered his superior Lieutenant Herdringer and ran an illegal gladiatorial event at Monad Outpost. The bounty hunter Bossk and the local street urchin Ezra Bridger had exposed Jenkes' illegal activities to the Imperial authorities on Lothal. Bossk also received a personal guarantee from Aresko and Grint that they would never hear from Jenkes again.[5]
            Taskmaster Grint, Commandant Aresko, and their stormtrooper escorts confronted the Gotal fruit seller Yoffar for not possessing a sales license. The check was part of a planned demonstration of the Empire to respond swiftly to problems. During the incident, Grint helped himself to some of Yoffar's jogan fruit. When Yoffar objected, the pair attempted to arrest him for treason. However, the Force-sensitive street urchin Ezra Bridger stole Aresko's comlink and used it to trick the Imperials into responding to a false code red alarm at the main square. Falling for Ezra's deception, Grint, Aresko, and their stormtrooper escorts released the merchant and headed to the main square. Upon arriving, the Imperials discovered that they had been tricked. In the midst of the confusion, a group of Spectres led by the former Jedi Padawan Kanan Jarrus stole several hover crates containing Imperial supplies. The Imperial authorities failed to apprehend the rebels.[6]
            Later that year, Myles Grint accompanied Commandant Aresko when he addressed the cadets at the commencement of the assessment phase of the term. These cadets had completed the orientation phase and were considered suitable to continue their training at the Lothal Imperial Academy. Most of the assessments took place in the Well, a purpose-built chamber that could be reconfigured to simulate a wide variety of obstacle courses and challenges. The assessment sessions were aimed at testing the physical prowess, mental acuity, leadership skills, and strategic adaptability of the cadets.[7]
            While Sergeant Currahee and Lieutenant Chiron supervised most of the assessments, Aresko and Grint took charge of training squad LRC077 for one week near the end of the term. Squad LRC077 were considered to be the most capable cadets.[7] The class included two young boys with hidden motives for joining the Empire—Zare Leonis, who wanted to discover the whereabouts of his missing sister Dhara Leonis; and Ezra Bridger who had assumed the false identity Dev Morgan. Having joined Kanan and Hera Syndulla's Lothal rebel band, Ezra had infiltrated the Academy in order to steal an Imperial decoder which contained information on the location of a powerful Kyber crystal. Zare and Dev excelled in their training which drew the attention of Aresko who subsequently alerted his superior: the Grand Inquisitor.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Myles_Grint</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMylesGrint</string></dict>
        <key>Amise Griff</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.789.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Admiral Amise Griff was a Human male officer of the Imperial Navy who commanded the Sector Group in the Bright Jewel Oversector and oversaw the development and construction of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought at Fondor. He later commanded the Blockade of Yavin.
            Griff was loyal to his Grand Moff, Governor-General Nox Vellam, but after the Battle of Yavin, he found himself reassigned to serve under Darth Vader's direct command.
            At first, he served as an agent provocateur on Fondor, a role in which he proved successful; he infiltrated a cell of traitorous officers with part in the Executor's construction, regularly reporting on them to Vader. The officers were not very sympathetically inclined towards the Rebels, but were growing jealous of Vader's unique position in the naval hierarchy and hoped to weaken him by selling the Executor's schematics to them. By feigning sympathy for their cause and organizing their operations successfully, Griff eventually became their leader.
            Griff was ready to arrest them when Luke Skywalker, their Rebel contact, arrived, and Vader ordered his capture. Griff then befriended Skywalker and helped him in his mission, still posing as a Rebel sympathizer. After some time, he formed a new plan: to organize a meeting between Skywalker and the conspirators to incriminate them and set up a trap for the Rebel hero. However, Vader insisted on personally supervising the operation, and Skywalker felt his powerful dark presence through the Force. Although Griff's stormtroopers managed to arrest the traitors, the now-alerted young Jedi escaped, bringing the schematics with him.
            Later, Griff was placed in charge of the Blockade of Yavin. This long, drawn-out operation was marked by rivalry between Vader's supporters and Vellam's. Early in the operation, Griff warned that the blockade was ineffective and that the Rebels were steadily building up their fleet, advocating a decisive strike before the balance shifted to their favor. Vader, however, was too preoccupied with a scheme involving a fake Obi-Wan Kenobi to engage in such an operation at the time, and Griff, stretched thin, watched his numerical superiority dwindle.
            When the Rebels later mounted their final escape attempt, Vader once again pursued his own agenda, this time to leave a portion of the blockade deliberately weakened, allowing the Rebels to escape so that he could he lure them into a trap, again not bothering to inform Griff. Instead, the Admiral spotted the flaw by himself, sending three Star Destroyers to reinforce the breach and taking personal command of this force. The Rebels, led by Luke Skywalker, managed to defeat Griff's fighters and escaped past his positions at the climax of the siege. He then opted for a gamble and ordered an immediate hyperspace leap after the fleeing enemy.
            With all the required information, the plan may well have worked. As it were, however, he brought his fleet out of hyperspace too close to Vader's flagship, the Executor, which had secretly been waiting for the Rebels at this precise spot, and the ships collided. Griff was killed and the three Star Destroyers that collided with the Executor were destroyed by the impact; the Executor lost its shields but suffered no major structural damage. It was, however, delayed long enough to allow the Rebels to escape.
            Griff was an ambitious man with few moral scruples, always ready to take advantage of the mistakes of others. He was also more than a little vain, wearing an expensive fur-brimmed coat, in addition to his standard service uniform. However, he was a competent, albeit at times somewhat brash, naval commander, and an accomplished agent with a working knowledge of ground combat tactics, making up for some of his other character flaws.
            In the Classic Star Wars comics in which he appears, Griff wears a non-standard, all-red rank insignia, rather than a standard admiral's badge.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Amise_Griff</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAmiseGriff</string></dict>

        <key>Tenn Graneet</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.791.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tenn Graneet was a Human male Imperial gunner who was master chief gunnery officer in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War. In 0 BBY, Graneet was stationed aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Steel Talon. He was killed on board the Death Star shortly afterwards during the Battle of Yavin.
            Graneet had served in the Navy for thirty years and had served in the Clone Wars as a gunner. Grannet was a lifelong military man, who enjoyed his career and was always eager to be placed in front of the largest gun available. At one point, Tenn sustained a muscular injury and, during the surgery, received a physical modification that increased the strength in his right arm by thirty percent. Tenn's nephew, Hora Graneet, was also a member of the Imperial Navy, and was killed onboard the Star Destroyer Battle Lance.
            As the Death Star neared completion, Graneet, being among those Imperial gunners who were the highest-ranking and best trained, was transferred to the superlaser gunnery crew. Graneet was initially thrilled with the new assignment, but as he familiarized himself with the new superweapon, he began to question whether any person was capable of wielding such power wisely.[1] He rationalized his concerns with the mistaken belief that the Empire would not actually fire the weapon at full power on an inhabited planet, rather on uninhabited moons, planets, and other bodies. During the final months of construction, Graneet and his crew trained on a simulator of the main firing control chamber, familiarizing themselves with the firing sequence and working to shorten the firing sequence as much as possible. Graneet took pride in his abilities and his crew, and was glad to be the first to test the Death Star's superlaser.
            As the NCO IC of the superlaser's gunnery crew, it fell to Graneet to actually complete the firing sequence by pulling the firing lever. The first time he actually fired the weapon was against an old Lucrehulk-class battleship, Fortressa, that was being used by the Rebel Alliance. Even though the weapon was only at four percent power, it was more than enough to completely destroy the Rebel capital ship. Eventually he grew such a dislike of his job, he started to wonder about other possibilities, and stated that it was his dream to become a commander of a Super-class Star Destroyer.[1]
            Graneet later fired the superlaser against the planet of Despayre. The destruction of Despayre took three shots to complete over the course of several hours. The first shot killed every living thing on the planet and cooked the surface of the planet. The second caused further tectonic stress to the planet, and the third shot finally blew the planet apart. After this, Graneet was highly shaken as he began to realize how much power the Death Star really had. He felt extremely guilty to have been the one to destroy Despayre, even though its main population had been that of convicted criminals. Later, Graneet was ordered to fire on the inhabited planet of Alderaan—killing nearly two billion sentients in the process.[2]
            Following the destruction of Despayre and Alderaan, Graneet had a severe pang of conscience. Knowing that he had sent billions to their deaths, he soon came to see himself as the largest mass murderer in galactic history, and knew that if somehow the Rebel Alliance were to win the war, he would be tried and executed for his crimes. As news that it was Graneet who fired on Despayre and Alderaan spread throughout the Death Star's population, many of the people who Graneet encountered began reacting differently to him. He also seriously began to doubt if he would force himself to destroy another planet when ordered to, but worried that if he refused, someone else would simply pull the lever for him. He even began to doubt his own loyalty to the Empire, and began to hate them and himself for causing the death of so many innocent civilians.
            When given the order to fire the superlaser at the rebel base on Yavin 4, Graneet froze, wracked with guilt and wishing desperately for something to save him from his dreadful duty. In desperation, he informed his gunnery crew and the overbridge to "stand by" and then repeated his order a few seconds later, until his wish was granted, as his few moments of hesitation were sufficient to allow Luke Skywalker to destroy the Death Star. Graneet died in the resulting explosion. Incidentally, his hesitation also allowed the Rebels to eliminate not only a significant force of manpower and materials fielded by the Empire, but also some of the most achieved and capable of the Empire's officer corps, including Grand Moff Tarkin.
            The gunner that mans the superlaser in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope was identified in the Death Star novel as Master Chief Gunnery Officer Tenn Graneet. Contrary to the nature of the character's responsibility, Death Star portrays Graneet as a morally conflicted individual who hated his actions but found himself forced to carry them out.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tenn_Graneet</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTennGraneet</string></dict>
        <key>Grecker</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.792.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Grecker was a male human member of the Closed that resided on the planet Carnelion IV approximately three years following the Invasion of Naboo.
            Greecker was a member of the Closed who was participating in a battle on the planet Carnelion IV when Obi-Wan Kenobi and his padawan Anakin Skywalker crash-landed on the planet. While the two Jedi were talking to Pran and Kolara, he attacked the group with his airgun. While the rest took cover, Kenobi destroyed Grecker's ship with a saber throw. As his ship plunged to the ground, he leapt from the wreckage and was saved by Skywalker. Pran and Grecker drew their weapons and faced off, but they were disarmed by Skywalker, who sliced their guns in half. They drew knives and charged at each other, but were stopped by Kenobi. When questioned, he accused the Open of starting the war, while Pran stated it was the Closed who destroyed the planet. Kenobi started to leave, but Greecker pointed out that he and the others would die if left on the mountain. The Jedi agreed to get them to safety.[1]
            As the group descended to the surface, Skywalker suggested salvaging parts from wrecked Open and Closed airships to build a working vehicle, but Greecker didn't think it would work. However, once overhearing the padawan mention a distress signal that was being broadcast off-planet, Greecker and Pran both changed their minds and agreed to work together.[1]
            As the group made their way towards the distress signal, they came across a box attached to a kite. Grecker snatched it out of the air and tossed it to the surface of the planet. He returned to the pilot seat and talked to Kenobi about his relationship with Skywalker. Their airship was attacked by Fishers. Grecker joined Kenobi in attempting to repeal the Fisher's attack. He was fighting the swarming Fishers when Mother Pran, who had escaped the airship on a flyer, blew up the airship. [3]
            Grecker escaped the crippled airship with Kenobi. They were confronted by a group of Fishers on the surface of Carnelion IV, but Kenobi was able to intimidate them and scare them off. Grecker retrieved a pair of breath masks from the wreckage and accompanied Kenobi across the Celadon Sea towards the source of the distress signal. When they arrived at the source of the signal, the two were attacked by several Carnelian dragons. Grecker fired off a flare to call for help. As Kenobi faced off against the creatures, Sera opened a door to her building and bid Grecker to get inside to safety. Once he was in, he tried to make her close the door and leave the Jedi outside, but Sera shot him in the chest with a blaster.[4]
            When the Closed forces arrive, drawn by Grecker's flare, they were confronted by Kenobi. Grecker, wounded but alive, told his clan-mates to kill Kenobi. However, they were interrupted by the Open who had operational mechs. Kenobi tried to convince Grecker to cease hostilities but was attacked by Mother Pran in a mech who killed Grecker.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grecker</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGrecker</string></dict>

He rebelled against the Dark Council and organized a private base of operations in Dromund Kaas, though his ambition eventually suffered a crippling blow by Darth Baras's apprentice
            Some time into the Cold War, Grathan went rogue and declared himself the thirteenth Dark Council member, with his own power base and sphere of influence within the Sith hierarchy. Although his claim had not been widely recognized, he controlled a substantial private army on Dromund Kaas. The Dark Council authorized all-out warfare against Grathan and anyone who supported him.
            After being driven from the Citadel, Lord Grathan holed up in his estate outside Kaas City. His forces there were made up of apprentices, loyal Imperial troops and cybernetic supersoldiers he developed in his secret weapons labs. His cadre of elite scientists — some volunteers, others kidnapped and forced into service — developed a seemingly endless number of war droids, reducing attrition in Grathan's army to near zero. Vereta Fraabaal was one of his apprentices.
            Willing to show Grathan he was not untouchable as he thought, Darth Baras commanded his apprentice to invade his estate and assassinate his son. Grathan's wife tried to bargain her son's life for her husband's, but Baras' apprentice eventually slew both mother and son.
            Lord Grathan first appeared in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, as an enemy during the Sith Warrior storyline on Dromund Kaas. According to conversation files, Grathan's name was originally "Lord Rathari", and his wife and son were Cellvanta Rathari and Beelzlit Rathari respectively. However, the name "Rathari" was later used on a Sith Lord on Nar Shaddaa instead of him.
            Lord Grathan's fate is upon player's choice.

        <key>Gorse Bendak</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.797.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gorse Bendak was a Human male former miner-turned Mandalorian Neo-Crusader who fought in the last years of the Mandalorian Wars. Rising to the rank of a Field Marshal, Bendak had a great success among the nomadic warrior clans. After the war, he became a bounty hunter until a fortune posted on his head left him unable to work in the trade. Without a job, Bendak turned to his friend and employer Ajuur the Hutt, who convinced him to wear his armor once more and enter the dueling rings of Taris under the alias Bendak Starkiller. Refusing to leave an opponent alive, Bendak retired from the ring after the Sith outlawed death matches. During the Jedi Civil War, he remained on Taris, watching matches in the cantina and hoping for the day he could return to the arena for another death match with a worthy opponent.
            Bendak was born into a family of miners, a tradition that went back generations that he decided to follow. In the year that the Mandalorians invaded the Republic, Bendak was stationed on the mining colony of Vanquo. Working in the mines on the dayside when the invaders attacked, he began working on a defense for when they would reach the mines. And sure enough, that defense held the Mandalorians back for two weeks, killing a dozen Mandalorian warriors.[2] Seeing his fighting spirit and abilities, he was offered to join the Mandalorians. Bendak reluctantly agreed, as the only other alternative was slavery.[2]
            A quick learner in the art of combat and weapon handling, Bendak rose to the rank of Field Marshal in only two years and received the golden armor of the Neo-Crusaders. However, his soldiering career ended when the forces under the command of Revan defeated the Mandalorian forces in the last battle of the Mandalorian Wars.
            In need of work, Bendak became a skilled bounty hunter, offering his skills to the highest bidder. Bendak found himself with a huge bounty on his head soon after, as he accidentally killed a nobleman's daughter, and was forced to retire the trade and turn to his employer Ajuur the Hutt on Taris. The Hutt encouraged Bendak to become a duelist, using his old armor and adding a stagename to his own, Starkiller. Despite the fact that Mandalorians were hated on the world, Bendak Starkiller became a popular gladiator in the dueling ring—killing many unfortunate opponents.[2] When the Sith took charge of the world, they immediately outlawed the death matches. Losing interest, Bendak decided to retire from the rings. He still hoped for a day when a worthy opponent would arrive for one last duel, so he would wander into the cantina to watch the duels.[2]
            That day eventually came, when the duelist known as the "Mysterious Stranger" became the new champion of Taris. An impressed Bendak came out of his retirement, wanting to duel him in an illegal death match. Revan, however, refused.[3]
            Bendak's canonical fate is unknown: assuming that the player picks the light side choice for this scenario, Bendak is not killed by Revan, as dueling with him gives dark side points for breaking the law, despite how vicious a killer Bendak is. If, however, the player picks the dark side choice for the scenario, Revan has the possibility to duel and kill Bendak. In this case, Revan obtains dark side points, the largest purse of credits from the duel, and Bendak's blaster—a modified Mandalorian blaster pistol that is the strongest standard blaster in the game—is given to Revan by Ajuur after his death and defeat. Under the argument that Revan risked his life, the player could convince Ajuur to boost the reward from 700 to 900 credits if the Persuade level is high enough. If the persuasion fails, the player could opt to threaten the Hutt for the reward instead, but this will gain more dark side points.
            Revan could also get the bounty on Bendak from Zax in the Lower City.
            The biographical details given for Bendak Starkiller above, though documented in the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide, contradict information from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, in which Tarisian death matches are said to have been outlawed for "nearly ten years" and Bendak is considered by the other duelists to be an old pro past his prime. As the game is set in 3956 BBY, this would have meant that Bendak had been a duelist on Taris in the years leading up to 3966 BBY, rather than as a miner on Vanquo before it was attacked by Mandalorians two years later.
            Zax, the Hutt responsible for running the bounty office at Javyar's Cantina, explains that Bendak acquired the government contract on his head after continuing to kill at illegal underground circuits for some time after the ban on death matches. The campaign guide instead attributes his bounty on having accidentally murdered a nobleman's daughter.
            Moreover, though the Sith enforced the ban during the game, it was not suggested that it had been they who introduced it, as their conquest and subsequent quarantine of Taris was heavily implied—though not outright stated—to have taken place following the destruction of the Endar Spire. John Jackson Miller stated that this tension would be explained in 2009, although that did not happen.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gorse_Bendak</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGorseBendak</string></dict>

He commanded the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Intimidator while it was stationed above the planet Scarif and participated in the Battle of Scarif when the Alliance to Restore the Republic Sphyrna-class corvette Lightmaker forced the Star Destroyer Persecutor to collide with the Intimidator, destroying both ships and eventually destroying the Shield Gate.
            Gorin was a human male who served as an admiral in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire. He was stationed on board the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Intimidator above the planet Scarif as part of the Imperial Orbital Command. The deployment's purpose was to defend the Citadel Tower on the planet's surface, which was commanded by General Sotorus Ramda.[1]
            In the year 0 BBY, a group of rebels aiming to steal the plans to the Imperial Death Star superweapon managed to slip pass Gorin's forces above Scarif using a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle and reach the planet's surface. After fighting broke out between the rebels and the Scarif garrison, part of the rebel fleet under the command of Admiral Raddus arrived to support the ground forces. Upon the fleet's arrival, Lieutenant Casido gave orders on the bridge of the Intimidator for someone to immediately alert Gorin and bring him to the bridge.[1]
            As the battle above Scarif began, Gorin contacted Ramda and alerted him and Director Orson Krennic to the arrival of the rebel fleet, under the command of Admiral Raddus..[3] On Krennic's orders, the Shield Gate above Scarif was then closed, separating the rebel and Imperial fleets from their respective ground forces. Gorin's forces then battled Raddus's above the planet until the rebel admiral ordered the Y-wings of Gold Squadron to launch ion charges at the Persecutor, the second Star Destroyer under Gorin's command.[1]
            The charges disabled the vessel, allowing the rebel Sphyrna-class corvette Lightmaker to ram into the side of the Persecutor and slowly push it toward the Intimidator. On the bridge of the Intimidator, Gorin tried to avoid the impending collision by ordering that his vessel reverse at full power, but it was not enough, and the Persecutor smashed into the Intimidator, sheering the admiral's Star Destroyer in two. The Persecutor then continued on into the shield gate, destroying it and allowing the rebels on the planet's surface to transmit the Death Star plans to the fleet. After the transmission was received, the Death Star arrived above Scarif,[1] and Gorin ceded his authority of the deployment to the superweapon's commander, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin.[4]
            Gorin had fair skin, gray hair and eyes.[1] When the rebel fleet first attacked above Scarif, Gorin believed they posed no threat to the Imperial forces on the planet's surface.[3]
            Gorin is played by actor Michael Gould in the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gorin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGorin</string></dict>

        <key>Nasan Godera</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.804.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Doctor Nasan Godera was a male Human scientist who worked for the Republic Strategic Information Service, the Galactic Republic's intelligence agency, during the Great Galactic War with the Sith Empire. Born on Balmorra in 3708 BBY, Godera was a brilliant scientist whose arrogance nearly crippled his career until he began aiding the Republic's war effort, and he soon became involved in the Shadow Arsenal project under Colonel Laren Omas. After the project was discontinued, Godera completed the weapons in secret but realized their destructive potential was too great, and he founded the Republic superweapon initiative to create weapons to protect the Republic and destroy the Empire. As head of the SIS's Advanced Development Laboratories, Godera trained a protégé in Boab Deduun, and was outraged when the Republic submitted to the Empire's demands in the Treaty of Coruscant. The fiercely patriotic Godera abandoned the Republic in protest and went into exile on the planet Taris, constructing a series of underground labs manned by droid assistants.
            However, Godera became the target of an Imperial Intelligence operation almost a decade into the Cold War when the agents of Sith Lord Darth Angral attempted to capture the scientist for his knowledge of superweapons. A young Jedi Knight was sent to retrieve the doctor before the Empire could capture him, and the Jedi managed to rescue Godera after pursuing his captor, Watcher One of Imperial Intelligence, across the ruined world. Godera returned to the capital of Coruscant to aid the Republic during the campaign against Angral, and his knowledge proved invaluable in deactivating the Desolator weapon aboard Angral's ship Oppressor. He remained assigned to General Var Suthra of the Republic Military as a scientific advisor as the Galactic War began, and he helped halt the Sith's efforts to kill civilians during the Battle of Corellia. Godera was killed during an Imperial attack, though his inventions would continue to be utilized by the military and the SIS during the renewed war.
            A Human male born on the planet Balmorra in 3708 BBY,[1] Nasan Godera quickly became known for his genius intellect as a young man. Godera's abrasive personality and political insensitivity nearly doomed his career as a scientist in the years before the Great Galactic War, but when the resurgent Sith Empire returned in 3681 BBY and began to attack the Galactic Republic, Godera was recruited into the Republic Strategic Information Service, the Republic's intelligence agency.[1] Not long after the Battle of Alderaan in 3667 BBY, Doctor Godera was one of many scientists recruited by Colonel Laren Omas of the Republic's nascent Special Forces. Omas convinced the group to design a weapon capable of stopping the Imperial threat, and over the course of several weeks the scientists developed a plan to build a "Shadow Arsenal"—a stockpile of interplanetary missiles with cloaking devices and payloads capable of destroying entire continents, intended to serve as an incredible deterrent against further Imperial hostility.[5]
            However, the group began to fall apart soon after the plan was finalized, and Omas' death in the Battle of Hoth in 3665 BBY caused the group to officially disband. But a determined Godera continued to secretly build the arsenal on the adrenal-producing world of Quesh, and it was not until he completed the weapon that Godera realized that the weapon's destructive potential was too much. Understanding that the catastrophic death toll the weapon would incur was too high a price, Godera locked the Shadow Arsenal away on Quesh and swore that from that day for his inventions would be different—they would either imprison or selectively target enemies, or guard against attack.[5] After spending four years studying the technology of the ancient Rakata species on the prison world of Belsavis, Godera founded the Republic superweapon initiative to develop new technologies and weapons.[1]
            Godera soon became the Chief Designer within the Republic's Advanced Development Laboratories, developing prototype technologies and working with the galaxy's greatest scientists. Fellow scientist Boab Deduun became Godera's protégé, and Godera's genius eventually led to the creation of multiple superweapons and advanced technologies. Among his inventions were the Sky Torch weapon and the spy ray, a long-range surveillance device that every SIS agent knew how to build by the time of the Cold War.[6]. Several superweapons—including the Planet Prison, Power Guard Enhancement System, Shock Drum, and the Death Mark laser—were developed years later from Godera's half-finished designs and research.[1]
            In 3653 BBY, the Republic was forced to sign the Treaty of Coruscant and end the war on the Empire's terms.[7] This infuriated Godera, whose devotion to the destruction of the Empire led him to protest the Treaty. After the Galactic Senate repeatedly ignored his advice and predictions that the Empire would press their advantage, Godera left the Republic in disgust and traveled to the ruined world of Taris. There, he constructed a series of underground laboratories with the help of droid assistants, and the scientist continued his research and experiments over the next decade as the galaxy experienced the tense Cold War. The droid RE-M0 became one of Godera's favorite assistants.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nasan_Godera</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascNasanGodera</string></dict>
        <key>Gobee</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.805.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Second-in-command to the Beast-Lord Oron Kira, Gobee was a Human male citizen from the Inner Rim world of Onderon. A Beast Rider who held the rank of commander, Gobee descended from a society of warriors who had originally been exiled from the city of Iziz for their refusal to submit to the power of the dark side of the Force, and forced to take refuge in the planet's wilderness. A man who typically demonstrated a great degree of loyalty, Gobee often went into battle by Beast-Lord Kira's side. He served with Kira in the final battle of the four hundred-year-long Beast Wars, leading his own contingent of soldiers in aerial assaults against Onderon's capital city of Iziz. When he deemed the city as being sufficiently secured, Gobee continued to lead the Beast Riders, this time from the ground, in a final attack on the Iziz Royal Palace. The actions of Gobee, as well as the intervention of four Jedi Knights, aided in the subsequent victory of the Beast Riders over the city's rulers, members of a Sith cult known as the Naddists—worshipers of the specter of Freedon Nadd, an ancient and long-deceased Dark Lord of the Sith.
            However, the peace that Gobee and his kin fought for was short-lived. After personally discovering the existence of Onderon's thought-to-be-dead King Ommin, the secret leader of the Naddist cult, Gobee again fought by Kira's side against Ommin's Naddist army throughout the Freedon Nadd Uprising of 3998 BBY. With assistance this time from military forces of the Galactic Republic, Gobee, Lord Kira, and the Beast Riders triumphed over the Naddists. Afterward, Gobee, along with his fellow Beast Riders, were able to finally enjoy a time of planetary peace, having defeated the dark side power of Freedon Nadd that had dominated their world for generations.
            Gobee was a Human male native to the planet Onderon. Rather than dwell in Onderon's only established city of Iziz, Gobee was a Beast Rider—warriors whose ancestors had been exiled from Iziz nearly four hundred years prior, and forced to take up refuge in the planet's uncivilized wilderness. By 4000 BBY Gobee had achieved the rank of commander within the Beast Rider army. On occasion he served as a Beast Warrior Commando, an elite faction of soldier within the Beast Rider ranks. Most of the time Gobee acted as the second to Beast-Lord Oron Kira, with whom he was also well endeared. He and Kira had fought valiantly by each other's side many times over in numerous battles, and because of this a great sense of comradeship developed between the two. During his tenure as Kira's second-in-command, Gobee was assigned many squads of Beast Riders to serve under him, which he called "wings," all of whose members followed him obediently.[2]
            In the year 4000 BBY, Gobee, Oron Kira, and several of Gobee's squads encountered an off-world starship while flying their warbeasts in the skies of Onderon. The Beast Riders had received news beforehand that the Jedi were arriving to facilitate peace between their people and the citizens of Iziz.[2] Thus, when the Nebulon Ranger, the ship that they had spotted, appeared in the Onderonian atmosphere, the Beast Riders immediately went on the offensive. They shot at the ship's hull with heavy blaster fire as it approached the city, managing to score several hits. The Jedi were also aware of the Beast Riders' presence, and had contacted Iziz to ask for some assistance. Iziz obliged them, as its walls were lined with their own perimeter defenses, and the turbolaser fire that they let loose was enough to halt the advance of Gobee and his comrades. The ship, which was carrying the Jedi Knights Tott Doneeta, and Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, was then able to then land safely within the walls of Iziz.[1]
            Meanwhile, Gobee and his team regrouped and prepared themselves for the next stage of their plan, which consisted of using the distraction of the offworlders' presence to assault the Royal Palace in Iziz, and attempt to abduct Galia, the daughter of Queen Amanoa, who ruled the city. With the hour finally at hand, Gobee's squads of Beast Riders entered the city though a weak point in the wall, and took the city-dwellers by surprise. As his men held the wall defenses at bay, Gobee, Kira, and several of their Beast Warrior Commandos attacked the palace, just as the Jedi were being introduced to Amanoa and her royal court. While the other Commandos engaged the Jedi, Gobee and Kira abandoned their beasts in pursuit of the Queen, who had fled with Galia under the protection of their Royal Guards. Armed with primitive knives and blaster pistols, Gobee and Kira made short work of the guards as they came upon the Queen and her daughter. Amanoa attempted to call upon the spirit of Freedon Nadd, an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith who had once ruled Onderon, and whose dark power had held dominion over Onderon for hundreds of years. Shrugging off her rants as nonsense, Gobee blasted the Queen with his pistol, lightly stunning her and rendering her temporarily unconscious. Meanwhile, Kira had taken Princess Galia into custody, and the remaining Beast Warrior Commandos retreated in haste with the Princess in tow. Despite suffering minor losses, the Beast Riders' raid on the Royal Palace had been a total success.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gobee</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGobee</string></dict>

            In the early resistance against the Separatist Alliance on Onderon, Gerrera and his fellow soldiers were outnumbered and out-fought by the Separatist Droid Army. They requested help from the Jedi High Council, which led the Grand Army of the Republic in its fight against the Separatists, but the Jedi Order chose not to become actively involved in the fighting on Onderon. Instead, they sent a team of advisors—Generals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Commander Ahsoka Tano, and Clone Captain CT-7567 ("Rex")—to train the Onderonian fighters. The Jedi and Captain Rex taught them proper techniques and strategies for taking on the battle droid army, and, through their efforts, the rebels began to turn the tide. Gerrera came to resent that the rebels chose Steela as their leader, and he was soon captured in an ill-concocted solo effort to rescue the deposed King Ramsis Dendup from the Separatists. They were both rescued by the rebels, who eventually mounted a final battle against the Separatists. Through their efforts, the rebels liberated their world and returned Dendup to the throne. The fight, however, came at a personal cost: Steela was killed during the final battle, and Gerrera was left to mourn his sister—feeling responsible for her death.
            At the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire. Later, Saw brought Galen Erso, Lyra Erso, and Jyn Erso to the uninhabited planet of Lah'mu. When Orson Krennic took Jyn's parents away from her, Saw found her and raised her until she was a young adult. Gerrera fought against the Imperial Military and led a resistance group known as the Partisans, a militant organization that some considered an extremist organization with terrorism tactics. His resistance cell, a continuation of his Onderonian resistance, was one of the first in the group of cells that formed the Rebel Alliance. He was later involved in the early campaigns of the Rebel Alliance, by which time his more-extreme tactics had come to stand in stark contrast with those of Alliance leaders Bail Organa and Mon Mothma. He eventually based his group on Jedha, where he met Jyn again. When Jedha City was destroyed by the Death Star, Saw told Jyn he was done running and stayed on Jedha, and was killed by the aftermath of the blast.
            During the time of the New Republic, Senator Ransolm Casterfo suggested that Gerrera and his Partisans, though part of the Rebel Alliance, engaged in terrorist tactics.
            Saw Gerrera was a human male who was born on the jungle planet Onderon during the last years of the Galactic Republic.[15] Growing up within the walls of Onderon's capital city of Iziz as an Onderonian with his sister Steela Gerrera, Saw learned to greatly respect Onderon's monarch, longtime King Ramsis Dendup.[13] In 24 BBY,[5] thousands of star systems seceded from the Republic and formed their own galactic government, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Within two years—in 22 BBY—the Republic and Confederacy broke into all-out war—a Clone War—and[16] King Dendup, wishing to keep his people out of the conflict, sided with neither the Republic[17] and its newly-acquired Grand Army of clone troopers, nor the Confederacy.[16]
            Not more than a year after the opening salvos of the Clone Wars were fired during the First Battle of Geonosis,[5] the Clone War continued to sustain itself on battlefronts across the galaxy. At this time,[18] at the behest of the Confederate Head of State Count[19] Dooku of Serenno, the[20] Separatist Droid Army invaded Saw's homeworld and subjected its citizens to Confederate law.[21] And to make matters worse for Saw, King Dendup was ousted from his royal throne and replaced with King Sanjay Rash, a "puppet leader" who answered directly to Count Dooku. King Rash enacted a Royal Proclamation that declared any who tried to usurp him from his throne would be declared a terrorist.[22] Deeply troubled for Onderon's future and undeterred that he and Steela had been banished from Iziz for openly defying King Rash,[1] Saw and Steela began to gather resources and other like-minded individuals in the hopes of forming a resistance to fight against Rash and his battle droid forces.[23]
            Approximately two standard years later, in 20 BBY,[5] Saw had become the self-proclaimed de facto leader of the Onderon rebels, and as a result of being banished from Iziz, the rebels took up residence in an abandoned outpost within a group of ancient ruins in Sector S-29 of the wilderness.[23] Around this time, Lux Bonteri, the son[24] of the late Mina Bonteri, the former senator of Onderon in the Republic's Galactic Senate[25] joined Saw and his resistance. Having obtained enough armor, blasters, and various other small arms to supply their forces, Saw, Steela, and Bonteri plotted to take back Iziz for Onderon; the rebel leaders, however, after a number of small skirmishes with battle droid forces, came to the realization that they were both under-equipped and had neither the training nor skills to wage open war against the Confederacy. Therefore, Saw and Bonteri reached out to the Republic, requesting aid. As a result, the esteemed Jedi High Council on the Republic's capital world, Coruscant, heard Saw and Bonteri's story via HoloNet transmission. Diminutive Grand Master Yoda promised that the Jedi Order would find a way to aid them.[3] A short time later, the freedom fighters were alerted to an intrusion in jungle Sector S-11 and Steela led a squad to investigate. Shortly, Steela, mounted on a dalgo steed, returned with Yoda's promise: Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, his Togruta Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and 501st Legion clone trooper CT-7567, nicknamed "Rex." Saw, mounted on his reptavian ruping, welcomed the four Republic military advisors to his world. Skywalker informed Saw that they couldn't fight the Onderonian Civil War for the resistance—Onderon, after all, was legitimately aligned with the Confederacy, no matter how illegitimate Saw viewed the situation—but he would train Saw's resistance to fight well on their own.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Saw_Gerrera</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSawGerrera</string></dict>
        <key>Gendar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.812.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gendar was a male Human native to the Undercity of Taris.
            Gendar was the village leader, and maintained some semblance of decency in the impoverished community.
            Sometime before the attack on the Endar Spire, Igear, the village shopkeeper, planned to usurp Gendar's role. Igear had much different ideas about survival within the Undercity. He believed that his ability to make deals and his running of the shop meant he deserved all the profits, regardless of those people who would bring salvage to him in the first place, whereas Gendar believed that all the Outcasts should look out for each other.
            Jealous of Gendar's position as leader, Igear planned to become leader by hoarding his inventory until supplies and food became scarce. Then, when everyone became desperate, he would give such supplies to the Outcasts in hopes they would become loyal to him, allowing him to take over as village leader. Gendar discovered Igear's plans before they came to fruition, and never trusted him again. However, he chose not to banish Igear because of his skillful ability to make deals.
            Gendar had always been skeptical of the tales that elderly outcast Rukil always told of the Promised Land. When an amnesiac Revan, a former Sith Lord arrived at the village, Gendar greeted the upworlder, and gave him directions and knowledge of recent events which consisted of Sith troopers, mercenaries and swoop gang members and where he last saw Mission Vao and Zaalbar; whom Revan was looking for.
            Revan then saved Hendar from a rakghoul attack, and then returned with a cure for the rakghoul disease for the Outcasts that were infected. This pleased Gendar. When Revan gave Rukil the journals of his descendants, Rukil then managed to locate the Promised Land and notified Gendar.
            When Rukil showed him journals that revealed the location of the Promised Land, Gendar was shocked and amazed. Though he realized that the journey to the Promised Land would take weeks, or perhaps months, and that they'd have to cross many rakghoul infested areas, he noted that the Promised Land offered much better lives for him and his people. The knowledge that their supplies were also high helped cement Gendar's decision to leave the Undercity in search of the Promised Land.
            Unlike many Outcasts Gendar was kind, and greeted Revan calmly. When Revan cured the infected outcasts he was proud of Revan, and regretted to have nothing of a reward, save the kindness of his people. He also believed that individuals should look out for each other and stick together, and also share with supplies equally.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gendar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGendar</string></dict>

            While on Taris, Genda was invited to a party in Taris's North Apartments with other Sith Troopers, including Sarna. At the party, Genda eventually got drunk on Tarisian ale and passed out on the floor, a fate shared by all of his companions who were off-duty the next day.
            Genda may have met the former Darth Revan and Carth Onasi at the Sith party, although he wouldn't have realized who they were. If he did, then Revan and Carth would have taken the opportunity to steal one of the soldiers' Sith uniforms while all the partygoers were unconscious.

        <key>Garrick Versio</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.816.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Garrick Versio was a human male who held the title of Inspector General and later the military rank of admiral in the Imperial Security Bureau, a law enforcement and intelligence agency of the Galactic Empire. He and his wife Zeehay had a daughter named Iden before divorcing when Iden was five years old. It was Versio who brought the planet Vardos into the Empire, and as a result was known as the "Hero of Vardos" and had a statue dedicated to him outside of the Archive.
            Prior to his promotion to admiral, Garrick Versio served as an Inspector General in the secretive Imperial Security Bureau.[1] Convinced that Imperial strength was necessary to maintain order in the galaxy, Admiral Versio extended that conviction into his relationship with his daughter, mercilessly pushing her and constantly testing her limits.[5] Eventually, Iden became the commander of Inferno Squad,[3] an Imperial Special Forces commando unit assembled by Garrick, which included Agents Gideon Hask, Del Meeko, and Seyn Marana, in response to the destruction of the Death Star. He first tasked them in infiltrate and destroy the Dreamers, a mission that resulted in an Imperial victory though saw the death of Marana.[1]
            Garrick commanded the Star Destroyer Eviscerator and partook at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, witnessing the death of Admiral Firmus Piett, whom he called a fool after the Super Star Destroyer Executor crashed into the second Death Star and was destroyed. Shortly afterwards, the second Death Star exploded, destroyed by the attacking Rebel forces. Admiral Rae Sloane, the highest ranking commanding officer to survive the battle, ordered for a full retreat. Garrick and the Eviscerator waited for Inferno Squad to evacuate Endor.[3]
            Above Vardos, Garrick confirmed the death of Emperor Palpatine to his daughter aboard the Eviscerator and shared with her the Messenger droid he received, which communicated the final orders of the Emperor: to begin Operation: Cinder at once. He sent Iden and Inferno Squad to Fondor to protect Moff Raythe, who transported satellites crucial to Operation: Cinder aboard his Star Destroyer Dauntless. Though a battle erupted at the Imperial shipyards above Fondor when Rebel Alliance forces attempted to hijack the ship, they were eventually destroyed, and Operation: Cinder was secured.[3]
            Moff Raythe's satellites and the Dauntless were in fact sent to target the loyal Imperial world of Vardos itself. Despite the planet being his own homeworld and teeming with Imperial loyalists, Garrick ordered the satellites turned online per the posthumous order of the Emperor, and commanded his daughter to extract Protectorate Gleb. However, during the mission, Iden and Meeko went rogue after deciding that it was not moral to leave loyal Imperial citizens to die. They escaped aboard the Corvus with their crew and some survivors, but Hask turned on them and returned to Garrick with Protectorate Gleb and her agent, prompting Garrick to promote Hask to Commander.[3]
            Garrick went on to run operations on Bespin and Sullust, procuring fuel and weapons for the shattering Empire, while he and Hask were hunted down by Iden and Meeko, now members of Inferno Squad in the New Republic. At some point in the final year of the Galactic Civil War, Garrick fell under the command of Counselor Gallius Rax, who was secretly in charge of executing the clandestine Contingency, and partook in the Battle of Jakku.
            As commanded by Counselor Rax, Admiral Versio went aboard the Eviscerator to the Battle of Jakku. During the battle, however, the Eviscerator was badly damaged in the battle and soon began to lose integrity; as it burnt in the skies of Jakku, Iden made an attempt to rescue her father after shooting down Hask. Though Rax also intended for Garrick to leave, he declined his daughter's rescue attempt. Looking out over the battle and his rapidly disintegrating starship, Garrick bitterly lamented having dedicated his entire life to an Empire which was indeed weak and flawed whilst Iden tried to convince him to leave. In their final moments together, he made peace with his daughter and urged her to leave and live a good life, something which he did not regard himself worthy of. Iden reluctantly left him on the bridge and evacuated in an escape pod, while Garrick remained on the Eviscerator as it crashed onto the sandy deserts of Jakku, perishing in the collision.[3]
            Garrick Versio was portrayed by Anthony Skordi in Star Wars Battlefront II.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Garrick_Versio</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGarrickVersio</string></dict>

He worked as Zelka Forn's assistant in Zelka Forn's medical facility; however, he also worked as an informant for the crime lord Davik Kang through Zax the Hutt.
            When Zelka expressed an interest in obtaining a sample of the rakghoul serum to the amnesiac Revan, Gurney was present and overheard his boss conversing with the newcomers. As Revan and Carth Onasi were leaving the clinic, Gurney approached them, informing Revan that Davik was also interested in acquiring a sample of the serum, and that he was willing to pay much more in credits than Zelka would ever be able to—all that Revan would have to do was present the serum to Zax, who worked at the Lower City Bounty Office. However, believing that the serum should be used to benefit the Outcasts, and other citizens of the planet, Revan gave the serum to Zelka, who was able to synthesize it in mass quantities. Afterward, Gurney expressed his outrage.
            At first, Gurney would come off as uninterested in conversation, and would direct strangers to talk to Zelka instead. However, Gurney would later reveal himself as a greedy man, who believed in putting yourself first before others. He was willing to share any secrets with the Sith or the Exchange, for a price. He also greatly admired Davik Kang, seeing him as a role model rather than a criminal.
            If the player decides to give the serum to Zax, Zelka will express his disappointment at the price Davik charges, and Gurney will congratulate the player and mention that he received a hefty finder's fee.

        <key>Alexi Garyn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.818.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alexi Garyn, nicknamed "Lex", was a male Human member of the criminal syndicate Black Sun. Serving as a Vigo for decades, Garyn eventually attained the rank of Underlord, the highest position in the organization. Leading the Vigos in the years before the return of the Order of the Sith Lords during the last decades of the Galactic Republic, Garyn saw the syndicate grow to great strength during his reign. Garyn and the rest of the Black Sun leadership were brutally slaughtered during an attack by the Sith Darth Maul in 33 BBY.
            A Human male Force-sensitive born on Ralltiir, Alexi Garyn was not identified by the Jedi Order at an early enough age, resulting in him being passed over by the Order as he was too old to begin the training. His dream of joining the ranks of Jedi Knights diminished, Garyn decided to develop his talents in a different way, turning to crime and becoming a member of the crime syndicate Black Sun.[1]
            By the year 76 BBY, the Vigos of Black Sun were already preparing young Garyn to take control of the organization; having already attained the rank of Vigo himself, it would only be a matter of years before he won the position from his competition, such as Boss Cabra. Despite some conflict between Damask Holdings and their support for Boss Cabra, Garyn attained the position of Underlord which he had desired and began to make many friends among the galaxy.[3] Under his leadership, Black Sun built a reign of fear felt on every planet from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories. Even with thousands of soldiers to execute his every order, Garyn kept himself in his fortress on Ralltiir surrounded by a cadre of elite guards. Under his direct command were the nine Vigos, his own personal bodyguard, an extremely skilled female warrior called Mighella, and his trusted secretary Oolth.[1]
            During the reign of King Ars Veruna of Naboo, Garyn earned a seat at his royal table during a feast to drown out the applause outside Theed Palace for Veruna's competitor Padmé Naberrie; the feast coincided with the infamous Trade Summit on Eriadu. Taking over the export of Naboo's rare plasma, Garyn supported Veruna's staunch opposition of Magister Hego Damask, whom Garyn felt had betrayed the trust of the Vigos of Black Sun but who also threatened to usurp the possibility for the self-same lucrative plasma-export contract with Naboo.[3]
            Unbeknownst to Garyn, Naboo's Senator Palpatine—who had (on his way to the Eriadu Summit) stopped briefly to also attend the feast in Veruna's court—was Darth Sidious, Sith apprentice of Magister Damask, the alter-ego of Darth Plagueis. In Palpatine's view, Garyn's presence at the feast marked him for death, as his dark master had viewed Garyn's relationship with Veruna as a clear signal of betrayal—just as the Black Sun overlord's subsequent collusion in Veruna's catastrophic nuclear attack on the Muun's fortress on Sojourn would irreversibly seal his fate. Although Sidious himself was the true mastermind behind the attack (which surprisingly failed in its aim to assassinate Damask), he and his master agreed that the Zabrak assassin Darth Maul (who himself, also ironically, had originally secured the proscribed nuclear device) should be sent to eliminate the Vigos and Garyn in swift retribution for their treacherous involvement—an untraceable Sith attack that would effectively cripple the formidable crime syndicate for many years to come and make it exceedingly difficult for them to regroup. Plagueis and Sidious believed that Black Sun, as it existed, was too much of a threat and an unnecessary hindrance to the Grand Plan, to a swift Sith achievement of galactic conquest.[3]
            Ordering Maul to hunt down two Vigos at first, Sidious anticipated that Garyn would detect the coming purge and order the surviving Vigos to his fortress on Ralltiir, believing they would be safe inside the impregnable castle. Following the deaths of Vigos Darnada and Morn, Garyn did just that; bring all the remaining Vigos to one location. Fortifying the complex in hopes of killing the Zabrak assassin, the Vigos and Garyn were gathered when Maul arrived, swiftly cutting through the bodyguards without suffering a single blow. As the Vigos attempted to escape, Garyn sealed them in the audience chamber while he, Mighella, and Oolth, escaped down a turbolift. As his Vigos met their deaths at the end of Maul's lightsaber, Garyn attempted to reach his yacht below the fortress but was caught by the assassin before boarding.[1]
            Igniting his crimson lightsaber, Maul attacked the Nightsister Mighella, who was able to identify him as a Nightbrother of Dathomir before cutting her in half at the waist.[1][3] While Oolth fled, Maul focused on Garyn and prepared to kill the man. Revealing himself as a Sith, Maul was distracted by his own pride and arrogance, and Garyn managed to attack the Zabrak, drawing blood. Enraged, Maul grabbed Garyn by the throat and drove him under the water, drowning Garyn and leaving his lifeless body in the small reservoir.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alexi_Garyn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAlexiGaryn</string></dict>

        <key>Finn Galfridian</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.820.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Finn Galfridian was a Human male from the planet Artorias during the Yuuzhan Vong War in 25 ABY. He and his sister Kaye came from a royal background, as his father Caled and stepmother Nina were the rulers of Artorias. However, their peaceful existence was shattered when the Yuuzhan Vong, an aggressive race of extra-galactic invaders, attacked the planet. Finn fought in the defense of his homeworld, an effort which ultimately failed, although he was able to evacuate safely from Artorias due to the timely assistance of the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. The rest of his family did not fare as well; his sister and mother were captured, while his father chose to remain on Artorias to lead a guerrilla resistance. During the battle, Finn demonstrated that he was Force-sensitive when he sensed his mother and sister being captured, and later became a member of the New Jedi Order under Skywalker's tutelage.
            Finn was also the only known Jedi of his time who could sense the Yuuzhan Vong.[2]
            Finn Galfridian was born in 6 ABY to Caled Galfridian and his Mother. Shortly after giving birth to Finn's sister Kaye, Finn's mother died. Caled eventually married Nina who treated Finn and Kaye as her own children.[2]
            In 25 ABY, Finn built a pair of goggles that linked to his droid's, Prowl, vision, as a gift for his father's birthday.[4]
            Life on Artorias was idyllic prior to the Yuuzhan Vong invasion in 25 ABY; the royal family could walk unmolested through the marketplace, and the planet did not even possess a defense force. Finn Galfridian, however, chafed under this peaceful existence, and spent his spare time taking physical risks under the supervision of his droid Prowl to alleviate his boredom. It was just after one of his exercises when the Yuuzhan Vong, an aggressive race of extra-galactic invaders, assaulted the planet. The Yuuzhan Vong had recently attacked the galaxy, destroying the planet of Sernpidal in the process.[5] They had already infiltrated Artorias with their spies, hampering efforts to warn the planet of the invasion fleet.[1]
            Skywalker offered to evacuate everyone in the hangar, but Caled personally refused to come along; citing his responsibility to the defense of his kingdom, he organized a strike team to attack the invaders. When Finn demanded to come along with the attack force, his father informed him that he now had to lead the Artorian people. As the refugees piled onto New Republic evacuation ships, Finn protested to Skywalker that he had no idea how to lead, but Skywalker assured him that if he pretended to know what he was doing, the people would follow him. Finn also demonstrated his Force affinity to Skywalker when he sensed his mother and sister being herded toward a Yuuzhan Vong slaveship. This prompted the Jedi Master to ask Finn to come to his Jedi academy on Yavin 4, which Finn accepted. As the ships fled from Artorias, Finn knew there was no going back.[1]
            While on Yavin 4, Finn began his training under the watchful eye of Master Skywalker. After much practice Finn was able to lift a rock using the Force. Master Skywalker congratulated the young Jedi, then placed a large boulder on the rock and told Finn to pick the rock up again. Four Jedi Padawans—Lowbacca, Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin Solo—took pity on him and offered to let him train with them. Despite some initial awkwardness around Jaina, Finn quickly showed his mettle in a practice duel with her. Jaina warned Finn of the dangers of hatred and of falling to the dark side of the Force after he expressed his worry and anger at fate of his planet and family. They were interrupted by Anakin Solo, who had heard a large noise issuing from a nearby cave. The Padawans went to investigate, and Finn ordered Prowl to scope out the cave while he monitored the droid's progress through his goggles, which could see through Prowl's photoreceptors.[6]
            A large Tuk'ata ran out of the cave toward the frozen Finn. Jacen was able to comfort the maddened animal by treating a wound it had sustained, and the Sith hound returned to its cave. Finn admonished himself for freezing in the face of danger, and expressed further anger toward the Yuuzhan Vong, which worried Skywalker. The Jedi Master discussed the situation with fellow Masters Kyp Durron and Lar Le'Ung. After receiving news of a Yuuzhan Vong attack on the planet Rychel, Skywalker resolved to take Finn along, especially after Finn appeared before the Masters and showed them that he had lifted Skywalker's boulder.[6]
            Finn managed to save his life as well as the refugees by using the Force to suspend the debris. Finn guided the refugees to the evacuation ships than went back to Tsalok who was now trapped beneath the debris. Luke watching, expected Finn to kill the warrior but to his surprise Finn cut away the debris and freed the warrior and told him to learn. Finn met up with Master Skywalker on an evacuation ship, and was congratulated by the Jedi Master for his actions. [7]
            After the battle Finn was sent by Master Skywalker to accompany Leia Solo, her children, and Lowbacca to obtain information from a smuggler on Nar Shaddaa. After exploring the planet Finn went back to the Millennium Falcon to get his droid Prowl. Upon returning to the Falcon Finn sensed someone entering it. Finn drew his blaster intending to stop the intruder but was stopped by a blaster at his back. Finn attempted to use a Jedi mind trick but it failed against the interloper who turned out to be Han Solo, who was their contact.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Finn_Galfridian</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFinnGalfridian</string></dict>

He was the King of Artorias and lived with his queen, Nina, and two children, Finn and Kaye. Caled was a veteran of the Galactic Civil War, notably fighting in the Battle of Hoth with the Rebel Alliance. He also fought in the defense of his homeworld when the Yuuzhan Vong invaded, although the planet was ultimately lost. Despite losing his wife and daughter to the clutches of the invaders, Caled organized a guerrilla resistance movement to delay the Yuuzhan Vong and find his family. His son Finn would escape the planet and join the New Jedi Order under the tutelage of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker.
            Prior to the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of Artorias in 25 ABY, Caled ruled an idyllic planet that did not even possess a rudimentary defense force. On the day of the attack, Caled was scolding his son Finn for taking reckless risks. As the two argued, the sound of a large explosion interrupted the two, causing Caled to immediately run to the weapons locker and grab blasters.[1]
            The king and his son rushed toward the marketplace to rescue Caled's wife Nina and daughter Kaye, but were unable to make it due to the surrounding chaos. Caled ordered his people to retreat to the shipyards and covered their retreat. The two Galfridians sealed the hangar doors, but the building was besieged by many of the Yuuzhan Vong. To make matters worse, the king was informed by his friend Dulac that all the ships had been sabotaged by a Yuuzhan Vong agent. He ordered Finn and his droid, Prowl, to fix the sabotaged ships while he and the rest of defenders prepared for the assault. The siege came to naught as the Artorians were saved by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who cut down the Yuuzhan Vong warriors.[1]
            Caled greeted his old comrade-in-arms, who told the king that the New Republic had sent ships to evacuate the populace. Caled personally refused to evacuate, citing his responsibility as king to defend Artorias, as well as finding some sign of his wife and daughter. Although Finn demanded to accompany his father, Caled told him that in light of his own death, the Artorians still needed a king. Caled quickly assembled a strike team to attack the Yuuzhan Vong invaders at the nearby beach. The last time the strike team was seen, they were engaging the Yuuzhan Vong in the surf.[1]
            In the meantime, Finn was recruited by Skywalker for Jedi training at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 after demonstrating his Force ability when he sensed his mother and sister in danger. Nina and Kaye had been overwhelmed by the Yuuzhan Vong warriors in the marketplace, and although Kaye was able to kill one of the warriors, the two Galfridians were herded into a Yuuzhan Vong slaveship and imprisoned.[1]
            Caled led the resistance from a base hidden deep underwater, striking against the Yuuzhan Vong's Vongforming of Artorias. During their missions they killed many sentries, which needed to be replaced. The reinforcement were taken from the slaveship Tsam P'ah, which imprisoned many of Artorias' inhabitants. The smaller number of guards aboard the slaveship allowed the prisoners to revolt. At the same time Caled led a mission to rescue his friend Dulac. They succeeded, and brought Dulac to their base.
            On Nar Shaddaa Finn had learned through a holocron that Dulac actually was a Yuuzhan Vong wearing an ooglith masquer. He raced back to Artorias with Jacen and Jaina Solo to warn his father. He was too late, however, as Dulac had already revealed himself to Caled and attacked him. Caled, despite his surprise, managed to hold his own in the fight, but Dulac slowly gained the upper hand. The timely arrival of Prowl, who shot Dulac on Finn's command was the end of the struggle between the two men. Dulac, realizing he was about to die, had one final trick up his sleeve: a plaeryin bol. Dulac launched the venom at the King, hitting him full in the face. Dulac was quickly dispatched by Jacen and Jaina, but Caled was already heavily wounded.
            After attempts by Jacen and Jaina to heal him failed Finn went to see see his father one last time. Caled was very happy to see his son as a Jedi apprentice and asked to see Finn's lightsaber. Caled admired the weapon and told his son that he knew there was anger in him and told him not to strike out with it. He proceeded to tell Finn the story about how he met Nina. It was shortly after his first wife, the mother of Finn and Kaye, had died and he and a group of soldiers went to remove a slaver named Dowron from the planet. Dowron had Nina as a slave and after Caled freed her she killed Dowron with her bare hands. He then admitted that at the time he was angry about the loss of his first wife and was looking only to fight the bad of Artorias instead of fostering the good in it, and that only Nina's unconditional love for him and his children quieted his anger.
            He then confided in Finn that he and Nina always knew that Kaye would be a leader but that they did not know what Finn would do, but Nina would be proud that he was becoming a Jedi and that he himself was proud of his son. Caled then tried to convince Finn to leave Artorias because the attacks of the Resistance were futile. Finn disagreed and responded by telling him about how the Yuuzhan Vong's lack of Force signature led to the death Jedi Master Lar Le'Ung during the Evacuation of Rychel and that he could in fact sense the Yuuzhan Vong.[3] Finn believed he was a freak because of this ability but his father assured him that he was not, and thought that maybe it was a gift. Finn then apologized for not getting there soon enough but Caled responded by saying that he was grateful to see the man he would one day be. Caled reaffirmed his belief that Finn needed to take his people off world and when Finn tried to respond about it being there planet Caled simply kissed his forehead and told his son that some things were more important than a planet. Caled then told Finn to leave so he could make a recording to Nina with Prowl. In the recording Caled to Nina how he always knew there was a secret that she kept but he knew he tell her children someday. After Caled finished the recording Finn returned and placed his hand on his father. The King of Artorias was now dead.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Caled_Galfridian</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCaledGalfridian</string></dict>

        <key>Fortris Gall</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.823.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Fortris Gall was a male human Jedi Knight at the time of the Great Galactic War, a conflict fought between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. He was an apparent practitioner of Jar'Kai, utilizing two lightsabers when a situation called for it.
            After the Treaty of Coruscant was signed, Gall was present at Republic Base 11A on Balmorra with several other Jedi, discussing the troop withdrawal orders given after the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant. Gall had been planning a rescue mission to liberate Demolitions Squad 419 from captivity by the Sith Empire (Post–Great Hyperspace War). Though discouraged from attempting a rescue by Togruta General Buryn, Gall left the room, claiming to merely be going outside to look at the stars.
            In point of fact, Gall departed for the Troida Military Workshop where Squad 419 was being held. While attempting to gain access to the workshop, he was confronted by a Sith who engaged him in a duel. The Sith boasted that Gall's lightsaber was no match for the power of the dark side, at which point he drew a second lightsaber from his belt and succeeded in decapitating the Sith warrior.
            Gall and the liberated Republic prisoners then launched an attack on the Imperial Forward Outpost XT-23, wiping out all resistance including a complement of Sith war droids. He was joined by Jedi Master Orgus Din who cautioned him, telling him to end the conflict on Balmorra. Gall responded by remarking that the Sith Treaty was a trick. Din responded by saying it was the duty of the Jedi to establish peace in the galaxy.
            The older man reiterated that Gall's presence on Balmorra would only worsen tensions with the Sith. He then informed him of recent developments on Dantooine where Republic troops had refused to depart with their commander and were still engaging Sith forces; in violation of the Treaty. Din ordered Gall to assist Satele Shan and Harron Tavus in suppressing the mutiny.
            When Gall arrived ahead of Tavus and Shan, however, he decided to support the mutiny and help continue the battle against the Sith. He later called Tavus to the ruins of the Jedi Enclave where he revealed his participation in the plot that was responsible for the bombing of the Senate Building on Coruscant. Later the "deceased" Master Dar'Nala resurfaced in the Enclave ruins to reveal her participation in the bombing plot. Master Dar'nala revealed she was setting up Sith Lord Darth Baras to take the blame for sabotaging the Treaty. Gall and Dar'nala persuaded Tavus to join their cause as Lord Baras was on his way to Dantooine.
            Traveling to the Crystal Caves, the party attacked Darths Baras and Angral. Satele soon joined up and aided the party. But then Baras revealed that Dar'Nala was behind all the violence aimed at destroying the treaty in an attempt to sway her to the Sith. Satele refused, but at the same time refused to support Dar'Nala, and convinced Tavus to do the same. Dar'Nala was furious at this, and moved to kill Tavus (whom Satele loved) to punish her former apprentice.
            This move turned Gall against her as well. Gall saw that Dar'Nala had gone too far, and defended Tavus. Dar'Nala wounded the Jedi Knight, and ordered Dalborra to finish him. The Wookiee responded by killing the rogue Jedi Master. With Dar'Nala dead, Satele led Gall and Tavus out of the caves. When they reported back to Din, Gall, who had apparently seen the error of his ways, said there would be no more attempts to disrupt the treaty.
            Gall was committed to his troops and refused to withdraw and leave Troop 419 in captivity. He was also stubborn and refused to follow orders that he did not believe in. On Balmorra, he refused to withdraw and further sided with the commander on Dantooine when he was ordered to convince the troops there to disengage.
            However, he also did not follow all the principles of the Jedi, as demonstrated by his part in the bombing of the Senate building to assassinate suspected Sith spies. But despite this, he did stop Dar'Nala from murdering Tavus, indicating that he had some sense of where to draw the line.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fortris_Gall</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFortrisGall</string></dict>

In the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Endor, during which the Galactic Empire suffered a massive defeat at the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Gulin was stationed on the[1] Imperial II-class Star Destroyer[2] Torment under the direct command of Lerr Duvat.[1]
            Gulin informed Duvat that a messenger had arrived on the Torment, and was ushered off the ship's bridge along with several other officers. The messenger, playing a message from the late Emperor Sheev Palpatine, informed Duvat that he would play a role in Palpatine's posthumous contingency plan, Operation: Cinder, and gave Duvat his target: the planet Naboo. In orbit over Naboo, the Torment deployed a climate disruption array and jammed sensors on the planet. Gulin informed Duvat that the array was at twenty percent and the jamming was at full power, noting that several hurricanes had begun forming on Naboo.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gulin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGulin</string></dict>
        <key>Walon Vau</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.825.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Walon Vau was a Human male who became a Mandalorian. Born on Irmenu as heir to the title of Count of Gesl, he was exiled from his homeworld after a love affair with the princess of a neighboring province fell afoul of the Imperius priesthood. He joined the Mandalorians soon afterwards, and became one of the mercenaries recruited by Jango Fett to join the ranks of the Cuy'val Dar and train the Clone Army. He was known for his black-colored armor.
            Walon Vau was born into the aristocracy of the isolated, feudal ocean planet of Irmenu. Vau's father, the Count of Gesl, was a domineering parent and a religious fanatic. As a youth Vau was beaten mercilessly by his father, but not all of the emotional feeling was removed. When Vau was a young man he attempted to join the Imperial Irmenu Navy, where his father was an admiral, but was told by his father that he was not good enough to join.[1] Vau then fell in love with the princess of a neighboring province, but a marriage was refused by both his father and hers. The couple's star-crossed rebellion fell afoul of the Imperius priesthood, which imprisoned her in a convent and temporarily exiled Vau from Irmenu.[2]
            Like many of the wandering dispossessed, Vau joined the Mandalorians. For this he was disowned by his family, and the title of count and Vau's inheritance passed to his cousin.[1]
            Vau trained the commandos in Delta Squad, and gave RC-1262 his nickname, Scorch, after an ordnance accident that left them both without eyebrows for a time. He also once had his arm broken in combat training by RC-1138, otherwise known as "Boss". Walon was extremely violent, once siccing his pet strill, Lord Mirdalan, on a young Ordo. Also on Kamino, he allowed Mird to hunt which resulted in the death of a "menial"  and "genetically inferior" Kaminoan, causing Vau to feel much the same way about the Kaminoans as Skirata.[3]
            Like Kal Skirata, he believed that the clones he trained should be brought up to be Mandalorian warriors. However, he took a different approach than Kal Skirata. Rather than treating the clones as though they were his own sons, he taught the Mando way through strict discipline--often verging on brutal violence, possibly due to his own upbringing. To teach his clones to be tough, he would often set them to fight one another, for melee or even live-fire exercises. He, however, gave them a choice: fight each other or fight him. Only one clone named Atin chose Vau. At the end of the fight, Atin was put into a bacta tank for a month. Vau believed his men had to know true pain to be able to learn how to withstand it. His intention was to have soldiers who could overcome whatever obstacle, including interrogation.
            For their training, Vau took it upon himself, refusing to pass on the dirty work of training to others to protect his own conscience. He asserted that it was for the clones' own good rather than due to sadistic tendencies that he trained them so brutally.
            Skirata and Vau would often disagree about training techniques--following Vau's brutal spar with Atin, Skirata nearly killed Vau despite not knowing who Atin was. Skirata gave Vau the broken nose he would sport for the rest of his life. However, despite appearances to the contrary, Vau did care for the clones he trained. Sev's being lost on Kashyyyk would hurt him deeply
            Vau's technique was shown to be effective. A year after the Clone Wars began only three of the commandos he trained were lost, as opposed to fourteen of Skirata's. He blamed the high casualty rate on the Galactic Republic, and specifically the Jedi for using commandos like infantry in the First Battle of Geonosis.
            Upon completing his contract as a member of the Cuy'val Dar, Vau returned to civilian life. A year after Geonosis, he was recruited by Kal Skirata in his plan to destroy the Confederacy of Independent Systems terrorist cells operating on Coruscant. He was called back due to the connections that he had with Skirata as well as his interrogation skills. This mission put him back in close proximity to Atin. Despite Atin's vow to kill Vau, he continued to work alongside Vau for the sake of the mission.[4]
            Towards the end of the mission, Vau worked with Jedi Knight Etain Tur-Mukan to neutralize the terrorist leader, Perrive. Vau demonstrated his sniper skills by killing Perrive with a single shot, and then had Lord Mirdalan retrieve the body with the datapad that they needed to collect. Along with Mird, the two returned to the greater battle and were responsible for the neutralizing of a fleeing terrorist.[4]
            After the mission's success, Atin set out to take his revenge. He attacked Vau and the two fought until Atin was poised for a killing blow. Before he could kill Vau, however, the two men were separated by Jedi General Bardan Jusik. The matter between Vau and Atin seemed to resolve, though on strained terms.
            A few months after the successful mission to Coruscant, Vau joined Delta Squad on Mygeeto where he had Delta aid him in breaking into the Dressian Kiolsh Merchant Bank. There, Vau stole his "rightful" family inheritance from the Vau family vault. To obscure who might have done it, he stole from several other boxes, acquiring more than fifty-three million credits worth in stolen goods. During their escape, Vau fell into a crevasse and nearly froze to death. He was eventually rescued by Skirata and Ordo in Aay'han. Everything he acquired--save for his own family inheritance--was given to Skirata to aid in his search for a way to slow down the clone's accelerated aging.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Walon_Vau</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWalonVau</string></dict>
        <key>Vaclen Tor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.826.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vaclen Tor was a Human male captain, who served in the Navy of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire.
            In 137 ABY, the Human male captain was in command of the Ardent-class fast frigate Steadfast. Assigned to the Coruscant Third Fleet, Steadfast was tasked with protecting the planet Ralltiir, when the Galactic Alliance Remnant and the Empire-in-exile launched a surprise attack on the planet, intending to seize as many Imperial ships as possible.
            When fleet's commander admiral Peto Kelsan realized that his forces were overwhelmed, he agreed to the ultimatum of admiral Edouard Fenel and ordered the fleet to surrender. However, Vaclen Tor refused to do so, reminding him of his duty and saying their fleet should self-destruct. Admiral Fenel retaliated by ordering Tor's crew to rise up in mutiny against him. The captain counteracted by reiterating that his crew were loyal to him and the Imperial throne, adding that they would not obey orders from renegades.
            Furious at this act of defiance, Fenel ordered all his ships including Kelsan's vessels to fire on the Steadfast, but Tor made a clever move and managed to position one of Ralltiir's moons between his ship and Fenel's fleet. After that Peto Kelsan ordered his men to set their ships for self-destruct and then leave them in the escape pods. Kelsan himself choose to stay on the Avenger and perished along with his fleet.
            However, Steadfast took some damage and its lifepods were offline, as was the self-destruct mechanism. Admiral Gar Stazi of the Galactic Alliance Remnant decided to deposit both Vaclen Tor and his crew to the surface of Ralltiir and then send the ship to Emperor Roan Fel as a gift. This effectively denied Fenel custody of Tor and his crew while affirming that the Alliance were allies but not Fel's vassals.
            By 138 ABY, Captain Tor remained within the Sith Empire's Navy. He was present during the Sith Imperial assault against the Hidden Temple of the Jedi Order on Taivas, in command of the Intruder. During the space battle against the combined forces of the Galactic Alliance fleet and Fel loyalist vessels, the Intruder sustained severe damage and was destroyed.
            As a competent military officer, Captain Vaclen Tor remained true to the codes of honor and duty even in the face of great adversity. Despite great odds and the prevailing unpopularity of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire, Tor remained loyal to his masters. Thus, he also rejected any moves towards compromising or submitting to his government's foes—the Bastion resistance and the Galactic Alliance Remnant.
            When his superior officer Admiral Peto Kelsan ordered his fleet to surrender following a coordinated Alliance-Fel Empire attack, Tor maintained his allegiance to the throne by disregarding the former's orders. Realizing that the Alliance and Fel's Empire intended to seize the vessels of the Coruscant Third Fleet intact, he ordered his crew to activate self-destruct devices and to bail out over Ralltiir. This brave tactic won the respect of both Kelsan as well as his Alliance adversaries Admiral Stazi and Captain Bey who proceeded to support him when Fenel ordered the destruction of all life-pods from the Coruscant Third Fleet.
            Vaclen Tor was introduced in the 36th issue of Star Wars: Legacy, Renegade, published by Dark Horse Comics. Created by series writer John Ostrander for the issue, the character of Vaclen Tor was drawn by established Legacy penciler Omar Francia. Kelsan was colored by Brad Anderson, who had worked on every comic in the series.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vaclen_Tor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVaclenTor</string></dict>
        <key>Wuher</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.827.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wuher was a human male from Tatooine who worked as a bartender at Chalmun's Cantina.[2]
            He strongly disliked droids and installed a droid detector in the cantina to keep them out.[3] Despite this, Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered with the droids C-3PO and R2-D2. Upon noticing their presence, he ordered that the droids would have to wait outside.[2]
            Some time afterwards, Boba Fett arrived at the cantina and asked for the identity and name of Luke Skywalker. After torturing an alien, Wuher told Fett that he and the patrons didn't know the identity or name of the boy he was searching for.[4]
            Wuher was an orphan, but worked his way off of Tatooine's streets by studying various species' biochemistries. With this he was able to learn what types of drinks would be desirable with various species.[1]
            Wuher disliked the concept of slavery, feeling that nobody should have to be a slave. He himself could have had an easier time in his work at Chalmun's Cantina by purchasing slaves, but decided against it. He disliked bounty hunters for similar reasons, but could not refuse their patronage for fear of what it would do to his reputation. His abiding dislike of droids stemmed from the death of his parents at the hands of battle droids during the Clone Wars. He had great respect, however, for Jedi, who saved him from an entire battalion of droids. His nightly ritual was to go home and drink a glass of blue milk to settle his stomach.[3]
            Wuher was portrayed by British actor Ted Burnett in A New Hope.[2] However, his dialog was dubbed with the voice of another actor.[source?]
            The character was known only as "The Bartender" at the time of the film's release, but the Star Wars Legends source Mos Eisley Adventure Set gave the character's name as "Cedo Partu." The character was later renamed as "Wuher."[5] The new name was later confirmed as part of the canon continuity established on April 25, 2014[6] in the reference book Ultimate Star Wars.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wuher</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWuher</string></dict>
        <key>Wullf Yularen</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.828.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wullf Yularen was a male human who served as a high-ranking officer in both the Galactic Republic and its successor state, the Galactic Empire. Serving the Republic during the Battle of Malastare Narrows, he was given an admiral's commission in the Republic Navy following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, assigned to Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. Yularen overcame an initially-rocky relationship with his Jedi superior to successfully combat the Confederacy of Independent Systems in several battles throughout the conflict, including Christophsis, the Kaliida Nebula, and Geonosis. Narrowly escaping the destruction of his flagship, the Resolute, by 20 BBY he was considered one of the preeminent naval officers of the time.
            With the Republic's transition into the Galactic Empire, Yularen resigned his commission in favor of becoming a colonel in the Imperial Security Bureau, and in this capacity rooted out sedition in the Imperial Senate as well as served as a liason to the Naval Intelligence Agency. Following the events of the Berch Teller campaign, Yularen was eventually promoted to head the reformed NIA, with the rank of Deputy Director. However, he continued playing an important role in the ISB, and became an early ally of the Chiss Thrawn as he rose through the ranks of the Imperial Navy, assisting him in his campaigns against the rebel agent Nevil Cygni.
            In response to the growing rebellion, Colonel Yularen assisted now-Grand Admiral Thrawn in hunting for the rebel mole Fulcrum, who leaked Imperial intelligence to the rebels. Working with Thrawn, Yularen discovered that the rebel mole was his former student Agent Alexsandr Kallus. Following the Battle of Scarif, Yularen was one of the officers assigned to the Death Star battle station, where he would be killed during the Battle of Yavin.
            Wullf Yularen was a human male born on the planet Coruscant.[1] Prior to the start of the Clone Wars, Yularen served as an officer in the Republic Navy. He participated in the Battle of Malastare Narrows, a conflict in which a fleet organized by the Corporate Alliance blockaded the planet Malastare. Despite his best efforts, the enemy fleet, led by the brilliant Harch tactician Admiral Trench, proved impossible to break, and Yularen lost many of his own forces. Eventually, a dispatched Jedi task force turned the tide of the battle, defeating the Corporate fleet, vaporizing Trench's flagship, and seemingly killing him in the process. Despite the victory, Yularen left the battle with a lasting fear of the Admiral's tactical capabilities.[11] He served in the Republic Senate Bureau of Intelligence for a time, until he retired.[7]
            Following the eruption of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY and the formation of the Grand Army of the Republic,[12] Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine encouraged Yularen to join the brand new Republic Navy, awarding him the rank of Admiral, making him the youngest member of the naval corps to achieve this rank.[7] Since a war bargain struck between the Jedi Order and Chancellor ensured that the new Jedi Generals would be paired with veteran naval officers, Admiral Yularen was assigned to Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.[4] Initially in command of a Venator-class Star Destroyer, this starship heavily damaged in the Battle of Teth, after which he would be posted to the cruiser Resolute, the flagship of General Skywalker.[5]
            During the Battle of Christophsis, Yularen initially failed to break through the Separatist blockade of the planet with supplies for Senator Bail Organa's force trapped on the planet. Recognizing his insignia on the Separatist flagship, the dreadnought Invincible, Yularen concluded that Trench had survived at Malastare and was facing him once again. Fearing his capabilities, Yularen regrouped on the far side of Leesis, Christophsis' moon. Reinforced by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi's Negotiator, Yularen personally participated in a mercy mission aboard a new model of stealth ship to provide relief to the planet below.[11]
            The ship, fitted with an experimental cloaking device, easily slipped past the blockade. However, Trench, emboldened by the lull in the fighting, ordered a flight of Hyena bombers to attack Organa's position on the planet's surface in an attempt to draw out the Republic force and destroy it. Despite Kenobi's preparations, Yularen recognized that any counterattack would result in heavy casualties for their fleet. The Jedi, Skywalker, was able to outmaneuver Trench's attacks and destroy the Invincible. Despite his initial skepticism and friction with the Jedi, the Admiral was impressed with Skywalker's unorthodoxy, who commented that they made a good team.[11] Yularen was later forced to withdraw due to a renewed Separatist blockade in orbit, but the destruction of the Separatist shield generator and ensuing surrender of General Whorm Loathsom allowed him to return with Master Yoda's reinforcements and secure a Republic victory.[5]
            Yularen then assisted General Kenobi in rescuing what was left of Captain Rex's troops holed up at Teth's B'omarr Monastery. He tried to allow Skywalker, his padawan Ahsoka Tano and Jabba the Hutt's son, Rotta to land on his ship but were unable to due to Vulture droids attacking the ship's hangar.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wullf_Yularen</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWullfYularen</string></dict>

A former Padawan of Jedi Master Dooku, who remembered Vosa as an excellent pupil, Vosa ultimately turned to the dark side of the Force following her banishment from the Jedi Order. Amassing an army of mindless slaves and assassins, Vosa became a cult leader whose influence reached across the galaxy, allowing her to establish connections with powerful crime lords such as the Hutt Cartel or the Dugs of Malastare.
            As her influence expanded, Vosa came to the attention of Darth Sidious—the Dark Lord of the Sith who conspired to topple the Republic from within. Viewing the former Jedi as a threat to his own plans for the future, the Sith Lord ordered her termination. The execution of this task was entrusted to Sidious' new Sith apprentice, Darth Tyranus, who was in fact Dooku, the Jedi Master that trained Vosa prior to his own experience falling from the light side of the Force. Rather than killing Vosa in person, Tyranus opted to place a bounty on his fallen apprentice. A mercenary who was skilled enough to defeat a warrior trained in the ways of the Force would, as Tyranus reasoned, make an ideal template for the clone army in development on Kamino.
            The contest was ultimately won by Jango Fett, one of the bounty hunters whom Tyranus hired to hunt and neutralize Vosa for the reward of five million credits. After tracking Vosa to her citadel on Kohlma, one of the moons of Bogden, Fett defeated the leader of the Bando Gora in spite of her Force powers and lightsaber skills. Tyranus, who witnessed the battle from the shadows, asphyxiated Vosa by way of the Force and subsequently persuaded Fett to be cloned. In the years following Vosa's death, her lightsabers were given to Asajj Ventress, a Separatist assassin who aspired to join the ranks of the Sith with Tyranus as her mentor.
            A Force-sensitive Human female, Komari Vosa was recruited as a young child by the Jedi Order[5] in accordance with tradition[6] during the last century of the Galactic Republic. After completing her studies as a Jedi Initiate, Vosa became the Padawan learner of the Jedi Master Dooku in 50 BBY. Despite possessing a volatile temperament, Vosa proved to be a prodigious student in the ways of the Force,[5] earning the respect of her Master who regarded Vosa as an excellent apprentice.[3]
            Komari Vosa accompanied Master Dooku and a Jedi strike force to the planet Galidraan[5] in 44 BBY[7] with orders from the Jedi High Council to neutralize the True Mandalorians.[4] The Jedi virtually annihilated their Mandalorian adversaries in the Battle of Galidraan; Vosa herself demonstrated considerable skill with a lightsaber when she personally killed twenty experienced soldiers in combat. Though the Council later came to regret the massacre on Galidraan, Dooku was impressed by his apprentice's natural talents and believed that Vosa's future was all but secure in the ranks of the Order.[5]
            Vosa's status as a rising star in the Jedi Order was cut short when her Master barred her from participating in the Jedi Trials. Dooku, along with the members of the Jedi Council, became aware of Vosa's secret infatuation with her legendary Master. This and her aggressive demeanor convinced the Order to end Vosa's training, thus deeming her unfit to become a Jedi Knight. Enraged at what she perceived as a betrayal by her Master and the Council, Vosa fled the Jedi Temple and joined a Jedi task force deployed to stop the Bando Gora's activities on Baltizaar. The mission was a disaster, however. The team was decimated and forced to retreat back to Coruscant; many Jedi lost their lives and others were captured, including Vosa.[5]
            Though the Order believed her to be dead, in truth Komari Vosa remained alive and was held as a prisoner by the mysterious cult in a dilapidated citadel on Kohlma, a burial moon orbiting Bogden. Subjected to torture and other forms of cruelty, Vosa was driven both mad and into the dark side of the Force. Embracing her rage, the deranged Jedi defeated her tormentors and replaced them as the new leader of the Bando Gora.[5]
            Komari Vosa—now a Dark Jedi and high priestess of the Bando Gora—maintained the citadel on Kholma as her base of operations from where she monitored her cult's activities throughout the galaxy[5] with the aid of her chief lieutenant.[3] Under Vosa's direction, the Bando Gora became a horrific icon of terror and intrigue, especially within the criminal underworld that became essential in her plot to expand the Bando Gora's influence and power. In order to do so, Vosa implanted brainwashing agents into death sticks, intending to use narcotics as a recruiting tool for the Bando Gora.[5] The poisonous substances—mind-altering neurotoxins—were developed and conditioned to suppress individuality and free will, thus enabling Vosa to use her Force abilities to turn drug-addicts into mindless spies and assassins.[3] This form of slavery gradually built her a small army of warriors that Vosa deployed on the enemies of her cult.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Komari_Vosa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKomariVosa</string></dict>
        <key>Korto Vos</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.830.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Korto Vos was a Force-sensitive male Human/Kiffar hybrid born on the planet Kashyyyk less than eight months after the end of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY. His mother, the Human spy Khaleen Hentz, had fled to the Wookiee homeworld after Jedi across the galaxy—including Vos's father, the Kiffar Jedi Master Quinlan Vos—were targeted for death as part of a plan by the Republic's Supreme Chancellor to seize control of the galaxy. However, Quinlan survived the Great Jedi Purge and made his way to Kashyyyk, where Vos, Hentz, and two other Jedi Masters were living under the protection of the Wookiee Palsaang clan. The young Vos was greeted by his father, who applied traditional Kiffar qukuuf tattoos to his face and proclaimed that he would never be touched by the dark side of the Force.
            Korto Vos was the son of Khaleen Hentz, a Human female spy, and Quinlan Vos, a male Kiffar Jedi Master.[2] He was conceived by a physical union of the two in 19 BBY on the planet Saleucami during the final weeks of the Clone Wars.[3][4] While the young Vos was developing inside his mother's womb, Hentz went into hiding. Across the galaxy, clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic gunned down their Jedi Generals[2] in a bid by the Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to wipe out the Jedi Order and seize control of the galaxy.[5] Believing Quinlan to be dead, Hentz followed advice he had previously given her and fled to the planet Kashyyyk[6] alongside the Jedi Masters Tholme and T'ra Saa,[2] who were enemies of the newly-declared Galactic Empire.[5]
            The three were taken in by Wookiees of the Palsaang clan,[6] and Hentz gave birth to the young Vos while living on the Wookiee homeworld.[1] Vos began his life as a black-haired, brown-eyed, fair-skinned Human/Kiffar hybrid who, like his father, was sensitive to the Force. He was born into Clan Vos,[2] a family who had until recently ruled the twin planets of Kiffex and Kiffu.[7] A playful boy, Vos enjoyed grabbing at dangling objects.[2] His full name, "Korto Vos," had been an alias previously used by Quinlan on several undercover missions during the war.[8][9]
            Eight months after the Chancellor's betrayal of the Jedi[2] and the end of the war,[5] Vos, his mother, and their Jedi companions were in a cave, protected by Gumbaeki, the leader of the Palsaang clan. The young Wookiee Chak was playing with Vos while the others activated a holocron of Quinlan's that they had discovered on-world. Quinlan was in fact alive and well, and he arrived at the cave as they listened, accompanied by the Devaronian smuggler Vilmarh Grahrk. Eight months prior, Grahrk had kept a gravely injured Quinlan safe from traitorous clone troopers, and the Devaronian had later nursed him back to health. In the cave, Quinlan met his new son for the first time and immediately applied traditional Kiffar qukuuf tattoos to Vos's face. He then proclaimed that his son's destiny was his own, but that Vos would nevertheless be kept safe from the touch of the dark side of the Force.[2]
            Korto Vos was created by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema, an author-artist pair who collaborated on a number of issues of the comic series Star Wars: Republic. His mother's pregnancy was first mentioned in the series' seventy-seventh issue, released in 2005,[4] and he first appeared outside of her womb in the eighty-third and final issue, released in 2006.[2] Since then, Vos's only other mentions in Star Wars canon have been in 2008's The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.[1][6][10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korto_Vos</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKortoVos</string></dict>

However, when the Empire had gained intelligence on the prison's extensive security systems from a captured program, the systems now ignored CorSec personnel and only attacked Imperial forces. During the process, Wolroff and his forces encountered an Imperial strike team that were here to reprogram the systems at certain control nodes.

        <key>Wade Vox</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.832.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wade Vox was a Human male Smuggler native to Alderaan and a Force-sensitive who participated in the Demolition games hosted by Jabba Desilijic Tiure.
            Wade Vox was born to wealthy merchants on the planet Alderaan near the end of the Clone Wars. As a young man Wade was piloting one of his father's transports along the Corellian Run when his home planet was obliterated by the first Death Star. Distraught over his loss and left with very few options he took up risky smuggling jobs and eventually found himself on Tatooine where he quickly fell foul of Jabba Desilijic Tiure after refusing to pay a protection levy at the Mos Eisley spaceport. He was subsequently forced to compete in his underground "demolition" games.[1]
            Vox would likely have been killed if not for his growing connection to the Force especially faced with such competitors as Boba Fett, he also learned that the X-34 landspeeder he had customized after purchasing from BoShek[1] had belonged to none other than Luke Skywalker who had sold it upon his departure from Tatooine. Vox looked up to Luke as the last remaining Jedi, and felt that he too would one day achieve greatness.[1]
            After the conclusion of the demolition tournament and with his new found freedom Vox followed his ambitions of exploring his connection to the Force at a deeper level when he constructed a crimson lightsaber[2], This in itself is a remarkable achievement due to his almost complete lack of training, a feat matched a decade or so later by Jaden Korr. Soon after doing so however, he was discovered by Aurra Sing who tried to take him out with a long range blaster. Vox deflected the shots with relative ease and evaded the notorious Jedi hunter almost to her satisfaction.
            Vox had a somewhat reckless and rebellious nature that would land him in trouble with such people as Jabba Desilijic Tiure and showed cockiness in his victories in the tournament.[1]
            Vox was a Force-sensitive and although had no formal training did show a degree of talent with this limited skill especially in his ability as a pilot much like a young Anakin Skywalker. He was able to generate a powerful Force attack from his speeder to cripple enemies for a short amount of time giving the impression that Vox must have spent some time practicing this or that he was naturally adept at this kind of Force power. Either way his flourishing abilities were worthy enough to gain the attention of Aurra Sing. Along with this is his building of a lightsaber which is near impossible for anyone without notable Force connection; just where and how he acquired the necessary parts for this task are unknown.[1]
            Wade Vox was featured as a playable character in Star Wars: Demolition and was voiced by Holt McCallany. An alternative ending to Demolition sees Vox thrown to the floor in Jabba’s throne room much to the amusement of Jabba's court. Aurra Sing then stands over him and reveals a Vibroblade. The end of this sequence gives the impression that he comes to a sticky end.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wade_Vox</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWadeVox</string></dict>
        <key>Woldar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.833.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Woldar was a human male who served as a commander in the naval forces of the Galactic Empire where he served in Grand Admiral Thrawn's Seventh Fleet by 2 BBY.
            A human male officer in the Galactic Empire's Navy, Woldar was a commander in the Seventh Fleet and often reported to Thrawn.[1][2] In 2 BBY,[source?] during the Battle of Atollon, Woldar was present on the bridge of the Chimaera, and reported to Thrawn that a ship had escaped their blockade. Although all the rebels eventually escaped, their base was destroyed.[1]
            In the aftermath of the battle, Woldar was assigned by Emperor Palpatine with guiding the Seventh Fleet in a search for the rebels who escaped Atollon. He was to be joined by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin in this assignment.[3]
            A year later, Woldar was aboard the Chimaera during the attack on Lothal. When General Hera Syndulla's Rebel Alliance strike force of T-65B X-wing starfighters emerged from hyperspace, Woldar counted 24 ships. In response, Thrawn deployed several TIE fighters including the new TIE/D Defender Elite prototype to intercept the intruders. After Syndulla steered Commander Vult Skerris' TIE Defender Elite into an Imperial light cruiser and a Star Destroyer, Woldar reported the damage to the Grand Admiral. Thrawn expressed regret but praised General Syndulla's skills as a combat pilot. Thrawn then ordered a second wave of TIE fighters to intercept General Syndulla's surviving fighters.[2]
            Commander Woldar was a human male with red hair and light skin.[1]
            Woldar shared a character model with different Imperial officers, which first appeared in the Star Wars Rebels Season Three episode "Iron Squadron" which aired on November 19, 2016. One of the character models, Woldar, was first identified in the end credits of Zero Hour which first premiered on Disney XD on March 25, 2017. He was voiced by Steve Blum, who also voiced the protagonist Garazeb Orrelios and many others in the series.[1]
            In Season Four, Woldar's character model continued to be used to fill in several background Imperial officers. In "In the Name of the Rebellion", the model was used three different times for three unrelated characters,[4] including for Captain Wells.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Woldar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWoldar</string></dict>

        <key>Mace Windu</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.835.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mace Windu, a Force-sensitive human male, was a revered Jedi Master and member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic. During his time in the Jedi Order, he once served as elected leader of the Jedi and, during the Clone Wars, as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. He was the greatest champion of the Jedi Order and promoted its ancient traditions amidst the growing influence of the dark side of the Force in the corrupt, declining days of the Republic.
            When the Separatist Crisis spawned the birth of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and sparked the Clone Wars, Windu and the Jedi rallied to the defense of the Republic and became the leaders of the Grand Army of the Republic. Throughout the war, Windu served the Jedi and the Republic in various capacities—on the battlefield in command of the clone army, on Coruscant as an overseer of the war effort and an advisor to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, and even as a diplomat to contested worlds, despite his disdain of politics. His exploits on the frontline served as a reminder of his reputation as a renowned Jedi warrior.
            As the war drew to a close, Windu became increasingly suspicious of the chancellor's motives, as Palpatine had amassed near-dictatorial control over the Galactic Senate, and sensed the rising power of the dark side in the galaxy. His suspicions were confirmed when Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight and the Chosen One of ancient prophecy, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who manipulated the Republic and the Separatist Alliance into war. Windu, along with Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin, confronted Palpatine with the intention of arresting him. Instead, the Dark Lord attacked them, striking them down one by one until only Windu was left. Windu bested Palpatine in the confrontation and—deciding the chancellor was too dangerous to be left alive due to his influence over the government—prepared to strike him down, but the intervention of Anakin Skywalker, who saved the chancellor's life, led to Windu's death. As a result, Skywalker fell to the temptation of the dark side and was renamed Darth Vader.
            Windu's actions led Palpatine to brand the Jedi as traitors to the Republic. The chancellor executed Order 66, and clone troopers across the galaxy turned against and killed their Jedi leaders, marking the fall of the Jedi Order. Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire, and the Emperor's new regime promoted anti-Jedi sentiment across the galaxy. Through propaganda, the Empire portrayed Windu as the leader of a criminal gang of Jedi who caused the outbreak of the Clone Wars. In spite of the propaganda, some of Windu's actions were remembered with fondness; General Cham Syndulla, who served alongside Windu during the Battle of Ryloth, remembered Windu with great respect and told the tale of how Windu helped him liberate Ryloth during the war.
            Mace Windu was born on the planet Haruun Kal approximately fifty years before the Clone Wars.[1] Due to his natural affinity to the Force, Windu was sent to the Jedi Order[3]—a monastic order of protectors, sworn to defend the Galactic Republic, and known as the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy[10]—to learn the Jedi arts.[4] As a Jedi youngling, Windu was assisted by professor Huyang in building his first lightsaber, which possessed an amethyst-colored plasma blade.[11] Rising to the level of Padawan, he became the apprentice of Jedi Master Cyslin Myr.[4]
            During Windu's apprenticeship under Myr, a man named Drooz had taken residence in a Jedi outreach temple on the planet Mathas. With the local populace suffering from the effects of the Niffin plague, Drooz convinced the people that he was a Jedi prophet who could heal the sick and the dying in return for their faith and servitude. Upon receiving reports of Drooz's activities, the Order dispatched Myr to assess and apprehend him. At the same time, Myr sought to teach Windu how to channel his frustrations into an appropriate emotion and therefore brought him to Mathas.[4]
            As they made their way to the temple, Windu observed the people's situation and pondered on what the Jedi could do to alleviate their suffering. He also denounced Drooz as a heretic and swindler who perverted the Jedi doctrine in order to take advantage of the people's misery. At that point his Master cautioned him to suppress his hostile feelings, having noticed how the thought of Drooz using the Jedi's teachings to prey on others frustrated Windu. They entered the temple and found Drooz with a group of Force worshippers, one of whom beseeched him to heal her child who was dying in spite of her many prayers and offerings.[4]
            Drooz's followers came to his defense when the Jedi openly confronted him. Using the distraction they created, he tried to escape from the temple but was pursued by Windu. Although Drooz's Gamorrean bodyguards were defeated by the Padawan, Drooz managed to injure Windu's left arm with his blaster pistol. He taunted Windu and mocked the Jedi's ways, sneering at their commitment to peace as he believed they should use their power to gain wealth through the faith of millions. Using the Force to immobilize Drooz, Windu disarmed him and vowed that he would never hurt anyone else. However, Myr intervened by ordering Windu to lower his lightsaber. While she understood her apprentice's frustrations, Myr believed that Drooz's punishment should be decided in a court of law.[4] Windu eventually continued training under the guidance of Grand Master Yoda.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mace_Windu</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMaceWindu</string></dict>
        <key>Pre Vizsla</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.836.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Pre Vizsla (pronounced /'pri vizlɑ/)[4] was a male Human from the planet Mandalore and was the leader of the Mandalorian Death Watch faction during the Clone Wars. Seeking to overthrow Duchess Satine Kryze and her pacifistic New Mandalorian government, in order to restore Mandalore to its widespread warrior ways, Vizsla secretly allied himself with Count Dooku and his Confederacy of Independent Systems. While governing Mandalore's moon, Concordia, and maintaining loyalty to Kryze in public, Vizsla led the Death Watch in secret from several Concordian mining camp bases. The Death Watch's terrorist attacks on Mandalore came to a head when Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived on Concordia with Kryze to follow leads on the Death Watch. When Kenobi discovered the Death Watch's secret base, Vizsla confronted them with several warriors and revealed himself as the renegades' leader. After engaging Kenobi in a short duel, Vizsla forced him and Kryze to flee Concordia.
            Vizsla conspired with Mandalorian Senator Tal Merrik to capture Kryze during her journey to Coruscant, where she intended to plead her case directly to the Galactic Senate, but Merrik was defeated before he could complete his assignment. Amassing an army of Death Watch troops on Concordia in preparation to take over Mandalore, Vizsla was forced to wait until his and Dooku's plot to turn Mandalore against the Republic was completed. Vizsla dispatched a Death Watch assassin to Coruscant to kill Kryze, as her death would remove the opposition to the Senate's upcoming vote to have Republic troops occupy Mandalore—an occupation which would allow the Death Watch to gain the support of Mandalore populace and "liberate" them from the Republic. However, the assassin failed to murder Kryze, and the plot itself fell through, with the Senate voting against occupying Mandalore. With this turn of events, Vizsla was forced to postpone his attack on Mandalore, as his forces would be unable to hold the planet without its people's support.
            At some point, Vizsla and his soldiers came across an escape pod lost in deep space which held the stranded Sith Lords Darth Maul and his brother Savage Opress. Harboring a common hatred of Obi-Wan Kenobi for his actions against them, they planned on having their revenge after their planned conquest of Mandalore. Gathering an army of criminals including the Hutts, the Pykes, and the Black Sun, Vizsla and Maul attacked Sundari, allowing Death Watch to act as heroes to a desperate population after the Duchess's forces failed to stop the criminals. With the support of the Mandalorian people, Vizsla ousted Satine and appointed himself Prime Minister and claimed the ancient title of Mand'alor. He also betrayed his Sith allies who were imprisoned but who managed to escape. Maul challenged Vizsla to a duel to determine the true ruler of the Mandalorians. After a long and difficult duel, Maul defeated Vizsla and executed him for his failures, before claiming his position as leader of the Death Watch.
            The male Human Pre Vizsla was a Mandalorian from the planet Mandalore,[1] who lived during the Clone Wars.[4] By around 22 BBY,[7] Vizsla had become the leader of the Death Watch splinter group in opposition[4] to the pacifist Duchess Satine Kryze and her peaceful New Mandalorian[8] organization's political dominance on Mandalore, a government that Vizsla believed dishonored the Mandalorians' generations-old warrior traditions. While secretly leading the Death Watch, Vizsla publicly supported Kryze,[4] seemingly renouncing his clan connections,[1] and became one of her trusted allies.[9] Rising to the position of governor of Mandalore's moon, Concordia—a separate province that operated independently of the New Mandalorians' government—Vizsla transformed several abandoned mining camps[4] into secret staging areas.[10]
            Vizsla eventually came into the possession of the Darksaber, a black-bladed lightsaber[11] that his ancestors had stolen from the Jedi Temple during the fall of the Old Republic. Many Jedi subsequently died to its blade.[4] Vizsla desired to reignite the feud between the Jedi and the Mandalorians, as the two factions had previously been enemies.[11] In order to overthrow Duchess Kryze and her New Mandalorians, Vizsla sought the allegiance of Count Dooku and his Confederacy of Independent Systems, which promised their support to Vizsla in his fight to undermine Kryze's rule and take over Mandalore. The Death Watch began to engage in acts of terrorism on Mandalore[4] in the New Mandalorian capital city, Sundari,[12] and on the neighboring world of Kalevala[9] to undermine Kryze's rule and breed discord among the people. Vizsla himself maintained Kryze's trust by appearing to spearhead the search for the Death Watch so that the warriors could be captured.[4]
            When a Mandalorian saboteur attacked a Republic cruiser, word spread to the Galactic Senate that Kryze was secretly building her own army to fight for the Confederacy and Mandalore became host to Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had been sent by the Jedi High Council to investigate the rumors of treason.[4] Learning of Kenobi's presence on Mandalore, Vizsla holographically contacted Count Dooku[4] from the Death Watch's secret Concordian military camp,[12] perturbed by Kenobi's presence. Vizsla initially could not understand Dooku's apparent unconcern with the Jedi Master's arrival, reminding Dooku of his promise to help overthrow Kryze and her government and stating that if the Republic intervened now, the Death Watch would be unable to take over Mandalore.[4] Dooku himself advised patience, proclaiming that the Republic's continued involvement in Mandalorian affairs,[12] combined with the Senate's impending order to send troops to keep the peace on Mandalore, would spread discontent amongst the Mandalore populace, causing them to rebel. Vizsla then realized Dooku's plan was to set up Death Watch's role as the people's liberator, and strengthen the renegade faction's insurgency.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pre_Vizsla/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPreVizsla</string></dict>
        <key>Windy Starkiller</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.837.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Windy Starkiller, otherwise known as Windom Marstrap, was a Human male, and a childhood friend of Luke Skywalker when he lived on Tatooine. He often spent time with Luke at Tosche Station.
            Windy was usually seen in the company of his friend Deak, who continually followed him around Anchorhead. Another Tatooine acquaintance, Biggs Darklighter, once characterized Windy as "a follower" and called Deak "a follower of a follower."[3]
            Windy's parents would sometimes visit Luke's aunt and uncle at the Lars homestead. When they were thirteen, Luke and Windy became lost in the desert and found themselves face to face with a Krayt dragon. They were rescued by Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom they only knew as hermit Ben Kenobi. When Windy and Luke were brought back safely to the Lars homestead by the Jedi, Owen angrily chased Kenobi away.[4][5]
            Windy and Deak were present when Luke was challenged to a speeder race by a local braggart, Gorm Maldorf, in The Cage. He warned Luke that Maldorf was dangerous, but he accepted the challenge. On the morning of the race, Gorm was found dead, strangled, in The Cage. After Windy and Deak helped him make his escape, Luke investigated the death and deduced that Gorm had been accidentally killed while trying to sabotage the race the night before.[6]
            By their late teens, the friends were part of a group of youths that included Biggs Darklighter, Janek "Tank" Sunber, Laze "Fixer" Loneozner, and his girlfriend Camie. The teens spent time hanging around at Tosche Station in Anchorhead, and raced their skyhoppers for fun.[3][7]
            When Biggs was accepted into the Imperial Academy, the friends and other locals threw him a party that was broken up by attacking Sand people.[8]
            Windy would often serve as a foil to Luke's dreams of leaving Tatooine to join the Academy. Once, when Windy found Luke replaying a Space Academy Recruitment tape for a countless time, he told his friend that he should grow up and be content with the life of a moisture farmer.[9]
            Sometime later, just before the Tantive IV was captured by Darth Vader above Tatooine, Luke challenged Fixer to a dangerous skyhopper race through Beggar's Canyon and through the eye of the Stone Needle. Windy flew along with Luke during the race, squealing with fear the whole time. He was frightened by Skywalker's reckless flying and called him "crazy."[3][9]
            Windy last saw Luke on the morning Biggs confided in Luke about his plans to join the Rebel Alliance. Windy, along with the rest of his friends, told Luke that he did not believe he had actually seen a firefight in the skies above Tatooine.[3][9]
            Following the destruction of the first Death Star in 0 BBY, Windy could still be found in Anchorhead. While here, he asked a spacer to find a wanted murderer named Blix Lanister, who had fled town.[10]
            Windy saw Luke again when he returned briefly to Tatooine when he was trying to hide from X-7.[11]
            The spacer agreed to carry out the task, and found Blix shortly thereafter. Blix was brought back to Windy, who paid the spacer 30 credits in thanks. He even said the spacer should consider a career as a security officer. Yet the situation with Blix did not end there. Windy also wanted the spacer to find one of Blix's gang members, a Rodian named Gleezwuq. Gleezwuq was the only member of Blix's gang whose whereabouts Windy did not know. He was sure that Gleezwuq would have evidence which would implicate Blix in his murder of Alita Sweetwater.[10]
            The spacer managed to find the Rodian gang member, and killed him. On Gleezwuq's person was the same blaster that Blix used in his murder of Alita. The spacer brought the blaster back to an impressed Windy, who was now certain that Blix could be brought to justice. The spacer was once again awarded another 30 credits. However, shortly after the evidence was brought to Windy, Blix's cohorts came into town and helped Blix escape Anchorhead. Windy tasked the spacer with one final task, which was to find Blix and his cronies. Windy did not believe that Blix would let himself be brought back alive again. He told the spacer to do what was necessary. Ultimately, the spacer found Blix, and killed him and the other thugs. Following the successful operation, Windy awarded the spacer 100 credits. Sometime following this event, Windy left Anchorhead.[10]
            Windy is barely glimpsed in the background of the Tosche Station scene cut from A New Hope. The scene is included the Blu-Ray release. His character is expanded upon in the Star Wars radio drama, where he gets several lines of dialogue.
            Windy appears briefly in a training level of the video game Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike, voiced by Andrew Chaikin.
            In the original version of Luke Skywalker's Walkabout, Windy is referred to as both Windom Starkiller and Windy Marstrap. One can assume that Windy is short for Windom. Leland Chee has stated that his last name is Marstrap in the Holocron continuity database.[12] However, in the colored reprint for Star Wars: Luke Skywalker, Last Hope for the Galaxy, Windy's last name has been corrected, and he is named Starkiller both times. Confusing things further, an action figure released by Hasbro in 2010 gave Windy's friend Camie the last name "Marstrap."</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Windy_Starkiller</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWindyStarkiller</string></dict>

        <key>Viidu</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.840.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Viidu, also known as the King of Cargo, was a male Human that lived on the planet Ord Mantell during the Cold War. During the war, he ran a freight company named Rendia Freight from an office in the Republic held Fort Garnik. Viidu at one time employed the smuggler known as Ace to deliver a shipment of weapons to him on Ord Mantell, but the cargo along with Ace's ship was stolen by Skavak, one of Rendia Freight's own employees, for the local Separatist movement. As the weapons were the property of an extremely dangerous crime lord known as Rogun the Butcher, Viidu put all efforts into retrieving them, hiring Ace and using his own employee Corso Riggs to track down Skavak and retrieve the blasters. Ace and Corso eventually tracked the blasters down to the Separatists main fortress in Mount Avilatan and attempted to retrieved them on Viddu's orders, but while the pair were away, Viidu's girlfriend Syreena, whom was having an affair with Skavak, murdered Viidu.[2]
            Viidu was a male Human who lived during the Cold War, a conflict between the reconstituted Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. During the war Viidu lived on the  Republic held planet of Ord Mantell in the Bright Jewel system[3] of the Mid Rim,[4]. Whilst on Ord Mantell, Viidu ran a freight transport company named Rendia Freight, which he controlled from headquarters in the Republic fortress of Fort Garnik. He employed a number of workers to run this company including his then girlfriend, Syreena who acted as a personal assistant for him.
            At some point Viidu accepted a contract for Rendia Freight to deliver a cargo of Blaster rifles for the dangerous Chagrian crime lord known as Rogun the Butcher. A smuggler known by the nickname Ace was hired by Rendia Freight to transport the blasters to Ord Mantell on their own personal vessel, dropping off the weapons at Drelliad village, a small village located near Garnik. Ace successfully delivered the blasters to two of Viidu's employees on the outskirts of Drelliad, Corso Riggs and Skavak. However once delivered the blasters, along with Ace's ship were stolen by Skavak, while the smuggler was away destroying a remote control station for a anti-air canon held by members of the Mantellian Separatist Movement in the nearby village. Skavak incapacitated Riggs with the aid of several Separatists who attacked the hangar to help him in the theft.
            Upon discovery that the blasters had been stolen, Viidu became incredibly worried due to the violent reputation of Rogan whom he feared would blame him for the loss. Determined to retrieve the blasters Viidu hired the smuggler, who was trapped on Ord Mantell without a ship, to help him track down Skavak. Skavak had informed the smuggler that he intended to give the blasters to the Mantellian Separatists, whom were currently engaged with the Republic in a civil war on Ord Mantell, and so Viidu sent Ace to find and old acquaintance of his named Reki. Viidu believed Reki was an expert on the Separatists and would know were to find Skavak and so gave the smuggler a survival pack of supplies to exchange with Reki, who was trapped in Talloran village due to Separatist occupation and a Republic blockade.
            The smuggler successfully found Reki and learned of a database containing details of all Separatist personnel which was kept on the island of Mannett Point, which he informed Viidu and Riggs of on his return to Garnik. Viidu explained to the smuggler about Riggs past with the Separatists, whom he hated for killing his family. Syreena then informed Viidu that Rogun the Butcher was attempting to contact him and he rushed off to speak to the crime lord, telling the Smuggler to download all data from the database as he left. Rogun informed Viidu that he did hold him personally responsible for the loss of the blasters.
            When Ace returned from Mannett Point having successfully retrieved the data Viidu thanked the smuggler, then said that he would have Corso decode the data. Still scared from Rogun's message, Viidu asked the smuggler to try and stall Rogun by completing the Big Boom Run, a smuggling run to a scientist named Trymbo in Oradam village to retrieve chemicals which the scientist had made capable of 'super-charging' Republic cannons. He believed that Rogun could sell this to the Republic and make a large amount of credits which would keep him happy and buy them time. While the smuggler left for Oradam, Viidu and Corso successfully located Skavak in the database and learned that he planned on meeting the Separatist leader named Dareg at the Separatist stronghold housed in Mount Avilatan. When Ace returned Viidu was overjoyed at the smugglers success and revealed the last stage of the plan to retrieve the blaster in which Ace and Riggs would ambush Skavak in the volcano stronghold and take the blasters from him. At the stronghold though Ace and Riggs discovered that Skavak had betrayed the Separatists and stolen a droid from Dareg instead of giving them the blasters.
            After Riggs and Ace left Viidu remained at the Rendia Freight building in Fort Garnik. During the pair's absence he caught Syreena contacting the Separatists and threatened to turn her into Rogun the Butcher. Syreena, whom unknown to Viidu was having an affair with Skavak and had been scamming him all along, murdered him in his own office to prevent him informing Rogun of her involvement.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Viidu</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascViidu</string></dict>

        <key>Veris Hydan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.846.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Veris Hydan was a human male who served as an adviser to Emperor Palpatine with the title of minister. Although he was not sensitive to the Force, Hydan was a scholar of Jedi and Sith lore and history. Upon the discovery of a Jedi Temple on Lothal, the minister was charged with overseeing its excavation and unlocking its mysteries, specifically on discovering an entrance into the world between worlds.
            During the excavation, Hydan encountered the disguised rebel infiltrators Sabine Wren and Ezra Bridger. Though Ezra managed to escape into a portal which led to the world between worlds, Hydan's forces managed to detain Sabine. He attempted to use Sabine's knowledge of art to decipher the mural of the Mortis gods, the gateway to the world between worlds. However, Sabine managed to escape due to the help of her rebel comrades. After Ezra and Sabine closed the portal, Hydan fell into a chasm when the Lothal Jedi Temple sunk into the ground.
            Veris Hydan was an Imperial Minister who served as an adviser to Emperor Palpatine. He was a scholar of Jedi and Sith history and lore. Following the discovery of the Lothal Jedi Temple in 1 BBY, Hydan was placed in charge of leading the excavation of the Temple and deciphering its mysteries.[2] The excavation site employed many Mining Guild personnel and was heavily guarded by Imperial stormtroopers, scout troopers, and death troopers. Minister Hydan and the Emperor were interested in accessing the "Gateway",[3] which led to a realm known as the world between worlds.[4]
            To avoid erasing any evidence critical to understanding the "Gateway", Minister Hydan issued orders that no personnel were allowed to touch any objects excavated from the temple. The Imperial excavation project attracted the attention of the Spectres rebel cell including the Jedi Ezra Bridger, the Padawan of the late Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus. Disguised as scout troopers, Ezra and Sabine infiltrated the excavation site. Unaware they were rebels, Minister Hydan stumbled upon the two examining art and chastised them for tampering with the objects. After learning that the Emperor wanted to contact him, Minister Hydan departed and left the death trooper commander to deal with the two scout troopers.[3]
            Inside the Mobile command center, Minister Hydan informed the Emperor that the excavation had reached the roots of the temple and uncovered a painting of the Mortis gods, which was reminiscent of art and iconography found at the former Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Hydan believed that the painting was the key to unlocking the "Gateway." The Emperor told Hydan that he sensed a great disturbance in the Force and opined that the death of Kanan had altered the fate of Lothal. Vowing to control the conduit between the living and the dead, the Emperor ordered Hydan to hasten his efforts.[3]
            Unknown to Hydan, his conversation was being tapped by the Spectres, whose droid Chopper had rerouted the Imperial transmission. Acting on this information, Ezra and Sabine began to unlock the painting of the Mortis gods, which was the "Gateway". Though Sabine was taken away for questioning by a group of stormtroopers, Ezra managed to unlock the "Gateway" by touching the Daughter's hand. Meanwhile, the stormtroopers brought Sabine into Hydan's office for questioning. After identifying Sabine as a rebel spy, Minister Hydan ordered that the camp be locked down because an intruder was on the loose. Minister Hydan, several troopers, and the captive Sabine arrived at the "Gateway" but were unable to stop Ezra from entering the portal. A stormtrooper tried to follow but the portal sealed.[3]
            In response, Hydan had Sabine brought into his mobile command center for questioning. Recognizing Sabine as the talented Mandalorian rebel artist, Hydan attempted to flatter her. When Hydan asked Sabine how she and Ezra had entered the portal, the Mandalorian refused to cooperate. Hydan then mocked Ezra's master Kanan, prompting Sabine to tell him that he was a pawn of the Emperor. Hydan countered that his power was a reflection of the Emperor's might. When Sabine mocked the Emperor for failing to unlock the "Gateway", Hydan claimed that Ezra was not safe inside the world between worlds and that the Emperor would eventually find him. Hydan then told Sabine that the "Gateway" was a pathway to time and that whoever controlled it controlled the universe.[4]
            Continuing his interrogation, Hydan told Sabine about the "Mortis gods", a family of three powerful beings known as the Father, Daughter, and the Son. When Hydan asked about the differences in their depiction on the Temple and Lothal mural, Sabine feigned ignorance. Hydan then warned her not to mistake his "pleasant demeanor" for weakness and observed that the positions of the Loth wolves, Daughter's head, and Father's hand had changed since Ezra's arrival. When Sabine defiantly taunted him, Hydan ordered one of the death troopers to strike her across the head with his rifle butt.[4]
            After reasserting his authority, Hydan and Sabine then discussed the painting of the Mortis gods. They concluded that the Daughter opened the portal while the Son closed it. Before they could continue further, Hera activated one of the thrusters beneath the mobile command center, causing the structure to rise and fall on its back. Sabine managed to escape with her fellow Spectres and headed towards the painting. They were joined by Ezra, who had escaped the Emperor's clutches and encountered Ahsoka inside the world between worlds. Ezra convinced his fellow Spectres including Sabine to help him seal the portal.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Veris_Hydan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVerisHydan</string></dict>
        <key>Tanis Venn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.847.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tanis Venn was a wraid hunter from Tatooine.
            Little is known about the early life of Tanis Venn. It was known that he was a former smuggler. After a friend of his crossed Sith Space and got stripped of everything, Tanis turned to hunting on Tatooine in pursuit of a less dangerous occupation. He used K-X12 battle droids to hunt and for protection, an action that earned him the contempt of other hunters, in particular Komad Fortuna, for the lack of sport in it and the damage it did to the wraid population as he had to kill a large amount of Wraid just to keep maintenance. Tanis was also married to a woman named Marlena which was against the warnings of her mother, and eventually she grew tired of his philandering ways and rigged his battle droids to explode if he moved, while he was in the middle of the Dune Sea. The choice of death by explosion or dehydration turned out not to be an issue, however, as Revan was able to fix the droids and rescue Tanis.
            Tanis Venn was a shameless womanizer, which earned the ire of Marlena. It would also suggest that he was also lazy with his work as he made his wife repair his droids and clean up his messes rather than him doing it himself. He didn't care if he could end up killing off of the entire population of Wraid saying: "When that resource goes belly up, I'll just move on. I'm just a wandering spirit, I guess."
            There is no definite Light Side option regarding this sidequest. It is possible to free Tanis and get a reward in credits, make him swear to give up using battle droids, or to simply leave Tanis to die.
            If the player is female then Tanis will flirt with her in the Hunting Lodge, calling the player "darling". This can result in Zaalbar growling at him, Carth Onasi to react poorly, telling him to "talk to her with a bit of respect in your voice or you end this conversation, minus a few teeth". Jolee Bindo on the other hand will Force Persuade him into just answering your questions.
            When you offer assistance to Tanis trapped in the Dunes you get a number of quotes from certain party members. Bastila Shan at first suggests leaving Tanis to his fate, which seems out of character for Shan, which Tanis also comments on and then she takes it all back and suggests to congratulate Marlena. HK-47 suggests blasting him. If T3-M4 is with the player, Tanis could ask the player to get it to help him, only to get an unflattering response. If Jolee is with you he could suggest programming them to do a tap dance. Carth Onasi suggests to help him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tanis_Venn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTanisVenn</string></dict>

In 1 BBY, he was in command of the cargo ship designated Freighter 2716, which the Empire used to transport a large kyber crystal to the Tonnis sector. He was killed when the crystal exploded as a result of Saw Gerrera's sabotage, destroying his freighter and the Star Destroyer it was meeting.
            In 1 BBY,[source?] Captain Wells[2] commanded Freighter 2716, which was tasked with transporting a large kyber crystal and several indentured civilian technicians to a rendezvous point in the Tonnis sector. These resources and personnel would be used to build the Death Star, the Galactic Empire's secret superweapon to rule the galaxy. Well's ship also included several stormtroopers and a squad of elite death troopers commanded by DT-F16. Enroute to the Tonnis sector, Freighter 2716 stopped at Faos Station.[1]
            Unknown to Wells and his men, the Partisans' leader Saw Gerrera learned about the freighter's connection to the Death Star and infiltrated it with several members of the Spectres rebel cell: Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, and Chopper. The rebels soon discovered that Freighter 2716 was carrying several indentured civilian technicians. By accident, they discovered the kyber crystal and dispatched most of DT-F16's squad. DT-F16 however managed to escape and inform Captain Wells that Saw's rebels had seized the crystal.[1]
            Wells alerted Director Krennic and obeyed DT-F16's orders to purge the escape pods and send her all security personnel aboard. Wells managed to jettison the escape pods in hyperspace, preventing the civilians from escaping. Despite deploying stormtroopers, they were unable to subdue the rebels and secure the crystal. DT-F16 warned Wells that the two of them would be in trouble if they failed. Freighter 2716 eventually arrived in the Tonnis sector where it rendezvoused with Captain Slavin's Star Destroyer in deep space. Wells informed Slavin about the rebel infiltrators and Slavin ordered his crew to secure the freighter.[1]
            However, Saw had destabilized the kyber crystal in an effort to deny the Empire the crystal and to destroy the Imperial ships. Saw, the rebels and the civilians escaped in a U-wing and a stolen Imperial shuttle. Wells along with DT-F16 and Slavin were killed when the kyber crystal exploded and engulfed both the freighter and Star Destroyer.[1]
            Captain Wells was a male human Imperial Navy officer with brown hair, blue eyes, and pale skin. He remained aboard Freighter 2716's bridge and delegated the fighting to DT-F16 and the stormtroopers aboard the ship.[1]
            Wells first appeared in "In the Name of the Rebellion", a two-part episode that served as the third and fourth episodes of the fourth season of Star Wars Rebels. He was voiced by David Shaughnessy, who also voiced Mich Matt and an unidentified Imperial officer. Although he was unnamed in the episode itself,[1] his identity was included in earlier drafts of the script.[2]

When Jabba decided to execute the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca by feeding them to the sarlacc as Skywalker killed his pet rancor Pateesa, Tezeri was assigned as one of the guards who accompanied the prisoners on a skiff to the Great Pit of Carkoon.

He became a Killik Joiner during a diplomatic mission on Alderaan, but retained enough of his individuality that he remained a loyal Imperial operative. He was also a known associate of Cipher Nine.
            Vector Hyllus was a second-generation Imperial; his mother was native to Jurio system and married Captain Adronik Hyllus after Jurio was granted Imperial governance. Vector expressed desire to join Imperial Diplomatic Service at an early age and displayed appropriate traits. He ranked high academically during training, and he was granted his request soon after graduation by being posted aboard an exploration and first contact vessel. During his time in the Diplomatic Corps Vector visited the industrial plants on Fest, full of toxic zones that made multiple workers sick.[3] He was reassigned to Alderaan due to diplomatic manpower needs with House of Thul. He served ably until his encounter with the Killik species and subsequent "Joiner" transformation. According to Doctor Eckard Lokin, Project Protean arranged Vector's meeting with the Killiks so they could study the Joining.
            As a joiner, he serves as the Oroboro Nest's Dawn Herald: a warrior and emissary of the nest, one who confronts the unknown. As Herald, Vector was more than a typical joiner and retains a sense of individuality.
            Funding for the Eagle’s terrorist network was traced to Alderaan; Cipher Nine was sent to identify and eliminate the source. The Imperial Agent met the Joiner contact Vector Hyllus and gained entry into House Cortess despite the initial hostile actions of Baroness Chay Cortess. After securing an audience with the Baron, the Cipher Agent managed to get a lead that Denri Ayl who was a respected Alderaanian mediator was tied to the terrorists after accessing the library records of House Alde.
            During this time, it was discovered that Baroness Cortess herself was also aiding the terrorists. The Imperial attempted to confront Chay Cortess, however, she instructed her guards to bar entry to the agent. This led to Vector Hyllus bringing in Killik support where they damaged the Cortess shield generator in the Glarus Valley. After fighting their way into House Cortess, the agent revealed the Baroness's betrayal to her husband Peyar Cortess. House Cortess was not implicated as a whole; however, appropriate responses and precautions had been taken. Vector Hyllus was flagged as an asset in Cipher Nine's employ, and permanent transfer from the Diplomatic Service was granted.
            After Doctor Lokin discovered Vector's connection to Project Protean, both Lokin and Vector assaulted Project Protean's HQ. Both "interviewed" the woman in charge and gained answers. Lokin discovered why they desired his demise and how his research was used to further Project Protean and Vector had his files deleted and stopped further Killik experiments. In the aftermath, Lokin became the new head of Project Protean. Though Vector said he would never trust Doctor Lokin, he was glad that they are on the same side.
            As Vector continues to travel with Cipher Nine, he researches the Imperial Citadel's database for any sign of other Killik Nests which migrated away from Alderaan centuries ago. After dreaming of memories of the Great Migration of the lost Killik Nests, Vector asks for leave in order to undergo a pilgrimage to follow the steps of their lost Killik kin. When he returned, he reported he was unable to find any of the lost Killiks and could only infer that they eventually separated into a thousand nests; each going their own way. A few moments later, he was contacted by another Dawn Herald: Daizanna of the Iesei Nest. Both Killik Nests rejoiced at finding their lost kin and invited the Agent to join in their celebration.
            Having discovered the resources and benefits of the vast Killik civilizations across the galaxy, Vector proposed to the Imperial Diplomatic Service a Killik-Imperial Alliance. Unfortunately, the Diplomatic Service ignored his report. An old colleague, Falner Oeth, reached out to Vector and proposed an alliance. In exchange for Falner's promise of future support for his Killik alliance proposal, Vector and his Killiks would use their resources to do dirty jobs for him and expand his influence. After completing Oeth's favors, Oeth was promoted and though he revealed himself to be repulsed by the Killiks, he fulfilled his end of the bargain. Oeth arranged for a summit between the Killik representatives and important members of the Diplomatic Service. After a few negotiations and instances of trade, relations between the Imperials and Killiks progressed.
            Vector had also gone through some changes in the meantime. Vector received a message from his former love Anora who pleaded with him to return to Dromund Kaas so they could reverse his "joining". Vector had contemplated her message and had come to the conclusion that he was content with his new life as a Joiner. Vector had also gone through the Chrysalis of Tranquility: a ritual used to strengthen the Dawn Herald and enhances his link to the universe.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vector_Hyllus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVectorHyllus</string></dict>

        <key>Kar Vastor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.852.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kar Vastor was a leader in the Upland Liberation Front on Haruun Kal in the decade before the outbreak of the Clone Wars. He was the lor pelek of the Korunnai, and their military leader during the local Summertime War. Kar and his people sided with the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, but his actions were judged as "crimes against civilization" and he was ultimately defeated and arrested by Jedi Master Mace Windu.
            Years later, Kar was forced to serve as a host for Imperial warlord Cronal, until he was saved by Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker during the Battle of Mindor.
            Born a Korun, Kar Vastor's early life seemed ordinary, though he was more in touch with Pelekotan (The Force in the Korun language, the literal translation was "jungle mind") than most. It was the Summertime War which forever changed Kar's destiny, as well as the destiny of Haruun Kal. At the age of fourteen, Kar Vastor saw his whole family massacred by jups, also known as jungle prospectors. How Kar Vastor escaped is a mystery. The stories among the Korunnai were contradictory, and Kar himself would not discuss it.[1]
            Vastor was abandoned in the jungle without weapons, grassers, akk dogs, people, or food and supplies of any kind. For most beings, it was a death sentence. However, Kar survived on his own for more than a standard year.[1]
            In the jungle, he learned all his impressive Force powers, but lost the ability to form normal speech like most other sentient beings. Mace Windu later suspected that it was the price Kar paid for his survival: he traded Pelekotan power for his humanity.[1]
            In the jungle, Kar likely discovered the Jedi starship that carried the Korun ancestors to Haruun Kal and used the starship armor to build his weapon of choice: vibroshields. A weapon of Kar's own design, they were shield-shaped vibro-axes. The sonic generators that powered the shields were fully sealed, and therefore were resistant to the metal-eating molds and fungi of the jungle. Also, because the starship armor was a superconductor; that is, it remained the same temperature throughout; not even a lightsaber blade could cut through the shields.[1]
            Kar Vastor grew to become a lor pelek; a jungle master shaman, witch doctor, wizard, and demon. In Korun legend, the lor pelek was a person of great power, and great peril. Kar Vastor lived up to his title—he was as unpredictable as the jungle, bringing life or death, a gift or a wound. In some Korun stories, a lor pelek was not a being at all, but was rather Pelekotan incarnate: the avatar of the "jungle mind." Kar Vastor, although still Human, became the avatar of the jungle's darkness.[1]
            During the Summertime War, Kar Vastor formed a clan he named the Akk Guard. Kar and the Guards were masters of both unarmed and melee combat, as well as the use of the Force. Without proper training, their usage of the Force was without grace; they relied on natural instincts, their Force powers aggressive and wild.[1]
            Thirty-five years before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Mace Windu visited the Koruns and shared with them tales of the Jedi. Kar Vastor possibly heard those tales, ending with he and the Akk Guards starting to mirror Jedi Knights. When Kar accepted a man as his Akk Guard, the man would build his own shields, in much the same manner as Jedi built their own lightsabers. Beginning with this ritual, the Akk Guards became a dark simulacrum of the Jedi. They relied on instinct while the Jedi relied on training; they used anger and aggression as sources of power, while the Jedi based their power upon serenity and defense; they used their shields as swords, while the Jedi used their swords as shields.[1][3]
            Kar and the Akk Guards used their vibroshields to deflect blaster bolts and projectiles in the same manner as the Jedi. This skill may have also been the result of tales of Jedi training told by Mace Windu.[1]
            Vastor's experience in the jungle determined his view on Tan Pel'trokal: Jungle Justice, a penalty devised by Korun culture, to punish crimes deserving death. Vastor sent all his captives in the Summertime War into the jungle without weapons, clothing, or other supplies. Because no captive could survive the jungle to tell the tale, the Balawai believed the Korun always killed their captives, further darkening the war.[1]
            Kar was a member of Ghôsh Windu. He believed himself to be its last surviving member before his dỏshalo (clan brother), Mace Windu, revisited the planet. The Summertime War had slowly killed the whole clan.[1]
            Despite the fact that every Korun could use the Force, and that Kar Vastor with the Akk Guards were nearly untouchable, the Korunnai were slowly losing the war. The Korunnai lived in the jungle, and because the jungle's fungi would eat almost every kind of metal, it made it impossible for the Korunnai to use technological weapons and equipment in the jungle. They fought with slug rifles, while Balawai used blasters. The Summertime War was also a war of extermination. Enemies were killed at first sight, regardless of age and conditions. While the Balawai could hide non-combatants in the city, the Koruns had no place to hide their own. However, as the name hinted, the Summertime War would halt during seasons like autumn and winter, and so the Korunnai still had time to recover.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kar_Vastor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKarVastor</string></dict>
        <key>Vasp Vaspar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.853.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vasp Vaspar was a human male politician who represented the Taldot sector in the Imperial Senate. He was also a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and served as the Minister of Industry in the Alliance Cabinet, part of the Alliance Civil Government. Though he was risk averse, he was not opposed to armed conflict—but he did not believe the Alliance was capable of destroying the Empire's planet-killing Death Star.
            Vasp Vaspar was a politician who represented the Taldot sector in the Imperial Senate during the reign of the Galactic Empire.[2] He was known to oppose Emperor Palpatine's harshest policies.[3] By 3 BBY,[4] Vaspar was a regular attendee of banquets hosted on Alderaan by Bail and Breha Organa, the viceroy and queen of the planet, which secretly served as planning meetings for rebellion against the Empire.[3]
            While continuing to serve in the Imperial government, he was also a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and served in its Civil Government as the Minister of Industry. This made him part of the Alliance Cabinet under the leadership of its Chief of State, Chancellor Mon Mothma.[2] As part of his role, he attended classified Alliance Cabinet meetings concerning topics such as the Death Star and Operation Fracture.[5]
            As Minister of Industry, Vaspar was charged with overseeing the vital yet limited resources of the fledgling Rebel Alliance. As a result of his role, he was more risk-averse than some of his fellow Alliance Cabinet members, though he was not opposed to open conflict with the Empire when warranted. However, when the Alliance learned of the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon capable of destroying entire planets, he did not believe that the Alliance could be successful in an attack against the battle station.[2]
            Upon the dissolution of the Imperial Senate, he, along with fellow former Senators Nower Jebel and Tynnra Pamlo, fled to an Alliance safe world.[5]
            Vasp Vaspar was a human male with black hair, brown eyes, and light skin. The red lining on his garb denoted the Battle of Balamak.[2]
            Vaspar expressed deep concerns about the safety of Yavin 4 due to the wildlife there, and was noted to have repeatedly asked for a personal force field. Mon Mothma tried her best to assuage his worries, but told her aide to have discretion on when to say "no" to his requests for an audience, which weren't always as important as Vaspar claimed.[5]
            Vasp Vaspar was a character created for the 2016 anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. In the film, he is played by Swedish-Lebanese actor Fares Fares.[6] The character's repetitive first name was inspired by similar redundancy in the actor's name.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vasp_Vaspar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVaspVaspar</string></dict>
        <key>Feyn Vann</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.854.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Feyn Vann was a human male scientist who served as a leading researcher at Nordoxicon Unlimited, before working in the Galactic Empire's Tarkin Initiative as part of the Kyber crystal research team on Eadu.
            A male human, Feyn Vann embarked on a scientific career and ended up joining the Nordoxicon Unlimited company, where he worked as a lead researcher. Eventually, Vann was recruited into the Tarkin Initiative, a secret think tank within the Advanced Weapons Research division of the Galactic Empire's Intelligence agency.[1] He and other brillant scientists were sequestered on the rainswept planet of Eadu, forming a team[3] tasked to research the fusing of Kyber crystal shards into larger ones, and the creation and redirection of a controlled chain reaction. The ultimate aim of their research was to power the superlaser of the Death Star, a moon-sized planet-killing battle station. Because his principal area of study was shield technology, Vann created a series of deflector arrays that redirected hypermatter streams from the superweapon's core reactor up to the crystalline firing array.[1] Vann was on amiable terms with Galen Walton Erso, leader of the research team, who called him "my friend."[4]
            One day in 0 BBY, Vann received news that Orson Krennic, Director of the Imperial Military's Advanced Weapons Research division, would be arriving at the Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory for an unplanned visit. Because it was uncharacteristic of Krennic to do so, Vann worriedly informed Erso of the situation. In return, Erso tried to appease his friend and colleague's anxiety, and the entire team then headed to refinery's landing pad to greet Krennic.[4] The director then informed the scientists that a Rebel sympathizer was hiding within their ranks, and he ordered the traitor to step forward. No self-denunciation was made, however, and Krennic told his death troopers to open fire. Like the rest of the team—except for Erso—Vann was executed on the landing pad,[2] confirming his earlier fears.[4]
            Feyn Vann had hair that had turned gray, brown eyes, and light skin.[1]
            Like the rest of the research team, Vann wore antiseptic coveralls whose top section altered color in the presence of dangerous contamination, and special grounded footwear designed to prevent potentially dangerous static charges. In a narrow pocket just below the right shoulder, he carried two code cylinders that gave him access to high-security laboratories.[1]
            Vann was portrayed by Paul Weston, usually a veteran stuntman.[5] Unlike the five other actors who played Imperial scientists of the Kyber crystal research team, he was uncredited out of all actually six scientists shown in the film.[2]
            In third issue of the six-part Marvel comic book miniseries adaptation of the movie, Vann was mistakenly portrayed as having blue eyes.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Feyn_Vann</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFeynVann</string></dict>
        <key>Varko  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.855.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Varko was a Human male who served as an admiral for Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Malak's Sith Empire during the final year of the Jedi Civil War. He assumed Saul Karath's position as Malak's second-in-command when Karath was slain by Galactic Republic commander Carth Onasi and two Jedi, Bastila Shan and Revan, aboard the Leviathan, Malak's flagship. Shortly after Varko reported on the status of the Star Forge, the Rakatan space station fueling the Sith Empire's war effort, Malak was slain by the redeemed Jedi Revan, and the Empire which Varko served was defeated at Rakata Prime.
            The Human male Varko was born in the era of the Great Sith War and Mandalorian Wars. During the Jedi Civil War, a conflict between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic,[2] Varko served the Sith as an officer in the Empire's Navy, rising to the rank of admiral[1] by 3956 BBY.[3]
            In that year, Varko was promoted to second-in-command of the Sith armada, after his predecessor, Saul Karath, was killed by two Jedi—Revan and Bastila Shan—and the Republic[1] commander[2] Carth Onasi aboard Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Malak's flagship the Leviathan. The position put Varko next in line to command the Empire after Malak. Sometime later aboard the Star Forge, the Rakatan space station that was fueling the Sith war effort, Varko informed Darth Malak that the superweapon was operating at 300% of the Sith's projections.[1]
            After the Admiral advised Malak that the Sith fleet had regrouped to the Star Forge and was awaiting the Sith Lord's instructions, Malak revealed his plan to use Shan, whom he had captured and turned to the dark side of the Force, to focus her power with battle meditation against the Republic, eventually conquering the Core Worlds. Varko was then dismissed by the Dark Lord.[1] Shortly after that, Malak was slain by the redeemed Jedi Padawan Revan, and his Sith Empire was defeated by the Republic at Rakata Prime.[2]
            Varko was a Human male who, after assuming control over the Sith armada, made it a point to inform Darth Malak of the status of both the Star Forge and the fleet. During his conversation with Malak, the Dark Lord noted his impatience. Varko was momentarily startled when Malak revealed his lack of a jaw, which was normally covered by a cybernetic jaw casing. However, that did not prevent him from saluting Malak after the conversation's end. In the duration of his service in Malak's Sith Empire, Varko wore a Sith officer's uniform. Before the events of the Sith Empire's defeat, Varko was balding; the hair that he did possess was gray in color. He had brown eyes, and was dark-skinned in appearance.[1]
            Varko appeared in the 2003 Xbox and PC video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, developed by BioWare. Although not stated in-game, Varko's name was revealed if the player read the dialogue box after the cutscene in which Varko appears. In-game, Varko is referred to as a commander by Darth Malak; however, the dialogue box showed that the character was an admiral.[1] This article treats the latter reference as the correct one.
            If Revan chooses to follow the dark side, the Sith Fleet triumphs over the Republic and Revan becomes the new dark lord.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Varko_(Human)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVarko</string></dict>

        <key>Vaneé</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.857.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vaneé was a human male attendant who served Darth Vader. In 19 BBY, he was stationed on Coruscant and approached Vader while he was meditating, Vaneé apologized for disrupting the Sith Lord before informing him that the Imperial Security Bureau had reported an incident in the lower levels of the city that was possibly connected to the Jedi. Vader instructed Vaneé to inform them he was coming.[3] He was later present in the Sith Lord's castle on the planet Mustafar in 0 BBY, and approached Vader—who was meditating in a rejuvenation chamber—to inform him that Director Orson Krennic had arrived to discuss the Death Star.
            Shortly after the construction of Fortress Vader, Vaneé was captured by a horde of Mustafarians who had invaded the fortress in hopes of destroying it and its master. Vaneé began to say mercy but was interrupted by the Mustafarian leader who grabbed him by his robe and mocked his pleas of mercy. However with a dark smile, Vaneé informed the Mustafarian that he was not speaking to him as Darth Vader appeared behind the Mustafarians with his lightsaber drawn and proceeded to kill the invading Mustafarians.[2]
            Vaneé was in an upper floor control room informing Vader via comlink that spy droids had detected rebel forces within the castle when Gee-Three and Skritt came upon him. Fearful when he saw Gee-Three aiming at him, Vaneé quickly alerted his master that the rebels had found him.  After Gee-Three demanded to know what the Empire was doing on Mustafar, Vaneé merely chuckled and replied he would like to see him try to shoot him just before the droid was lifted off the floor. Vaneé laughed after Gee-Three asked he was lifting him and responded that it was his master's doing. With a sadistic smile, Vaneé watched as Gee-Three was ripped apart and fell to the floor in pieces.[4]
            Moments later, Vaneé, wielding an ax, confronted rebel Commander Lina Graf and Skritt in one of the castle's corridors after the pair had been surrounded by the castle's security droids. He asked Graf if she was sure ghosts did not exist as he ominously claimed that the lost souls of his master's victims roam the castle's hallways included that of their comrade, the thief. After Graf identified the supposed thief as their colleague Hudd, Vaneé revealed that Hudd had paid the price for trying to take something that was not his and he had not been the first to meet that fate. Vaneé then told Graf and Skritt the story of the first Mustafarian raid on the fortress and how the forces where eventually slaughtered by his master. Even after Vaneé told the rebels such would be their fate, Graf replied that he did not frighten them as she pulled her blaster on him, stating she had faced real monsters. Vaneé informed Graf that she would know fear as he introduced her to his master, Darth Vader who had appeared behind her. Vaneé smiled as he watched Vader deflect Graf's blaster shot and hurled the bisected torso of her droid Crater at her.[2]
            The Sith Lord approached Vaneé and voiced his disappointed in his attendant by chiding his fear of the rebels. Cowering, Vaneé replied how the rebels had tried to steal Vader's treasures after breaking into the castle. Vaneé watched as his master used the Force to lift Graf but was suddenly shoved by Crater, knocking him against Vader, allowing the rebels a chance to escape. A short time later, Vaneé informed Vader that the castle was under attack by an AT-ST which Skritt had commandeered.[2]
            Vaneé was present on the landing pad of the castle when Director Orson Krennic disembarked his shuttle after arriving on Mustafar. Without a word, Vaneé led Krennic into the castle and took him deep into the facility until they had arrived to a rotunda that looked out onto Mustafar's landscape. He motioned for the Director to wait before he proceeded to leave via a door on the other side of the chamber.[5]
            Vaneé made his way to Vader's private rejuvenation chamber and entered, passing through the chamber's two set of security doors. Approaching the bacta tank centered in the middle of the chamber, Vaneé knelt with his head bowed. As he stated that Krennic had arrived at the castle, Vaneé looked up directly to the tank to see Vader's form emerge from within the bacta. Vaneé bowed his head as the tank started to drain.[1]
            Moments later, Vaneé returned to the rotunda and made his way pass Krennic without speaking anything to him which was hardly noticed at all by Krennic. He then disappeared into the corridor. After Vader's meeting with Krennic had come to an end, Vaneé met Krennic as the man stumbled out from the rotunda. Silently tipping his head, he motioned for the Director to follow him as he led Krennic back down the same path they had taken before. After a few moments as they walked, Vaneé spoke for the first time, telling Krennic that he was one of the few individuals who had had the honor of seeing Vader in his sanctum. Upon reaching the door of the landing pad, Vaneé cautioned the Director to keep what he had witnessed to himself.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vane%C3%A9</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVanee</string></dict>

He was then part of the four-pilot contingent that was reallocated to Base One on Yavin 4.[1] In the beginning battle of the Galactic Civil War, Grek participated in the Rebellion's attack on the Galactic Empire's Shield Gate above the planet Scarif, flying a T-65B X-wing starfighter in Blue Squadron.[2] Grek, under the callsign of Blue Six,[1] attempted to followed Blue Leader General Antoc Merrick through the Shield Gate opening per Admiral Raddus' orders; however the Imperials were able to close the gate before Grek and Unidentified Blue Squadron pilot 2 entered, resulting in their deaths.

        <key>Finis Valorum</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.859.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Finis Valorum was a Human male who served as the Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, holding office from 40 BBY until Queen Padmé Amidala introduced a Vote of No Confidence against him in the Galactic Senate in 32 BBY (after being tricked into doing this by Senator Palpatine). He was subsequently replaced by Palpatine of Naboo.
            Finis Valorum was born into a renowned political dynasty. As a young man, he received dozens of job offers from wealthy friends of his family, but he instead chose challenging assignments that would test his character. He would eventually serve under frontier conditions as a judge on the recently-discovered Republic protectorate of Veccacopia. Unlike his predecessors in the post, he worked hard to affect change; upon learning that the native Cacops were hiring stand-ins to serve their sentences, as his bailiffs were unable to distinguish between individuals of the species, he instituted mandatory retinal scanning. In doing so, Valorum broke a corruption ring within Veccacopia's judicial office.[1]
            After leaving Veccacopia, Valorum served with Republic police forces as a troop transport driver in the outlying regions before attaining a post in the military advisory office of Supreme Chancellor Kalpana. Valorum held elective office for the first time when he was in his late thirties, moving his residence from his homeworld of Coruscant to Spira and, based in part on his family's reputation and political contacts, winning an election to become the Senator of the Lytton sector. Valorum rose through the unseen pecking order of the Galactic Senate quickly, making short-term allies and lasting enemies.[1] As a Senator, Valorum was the leading opponent of the movement he dubbed the Militarists and harbored deep suspicions regarding the motives of their leader, Seswenna Senator Ranulph Tarkin.[6] He was a member of the Core faction and had been involved with negotiations to end the Stark Hyperspace War.[2][4][7]
            Senator Valorum became a prominent political figure in the aftermath of the Stark Hyperspace War[8] and entered his first term as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic in 40 BBY, following an election which the Tarkin family helped to push in his favor on the condition that he posthumously decorate Ranulph Tarkin for his role in the resolution of the conflict.[9] As Chancellor, Valorum declared Ranulph Tarkin the "Hero of Troiken," resulting in an increase in support for Militarism.[10] Valorum's election was perceived as hollow and cynical; his enemies believed he would be easy to control, his allies supported him only because they felt that he was the best prospect in an unremarkable group of candidates, and the public knew nothing about him other than his famous surname.[1]
            Despite the aforementioned disadvantages, combined with his apparent lack of charisma, Valorum won a second four-year term in office[1] in 36 BBY,[9] albeit by a very slim margin. What little support Valorum still enjoyed vanished as he failed to overcome the apathy and dishonesty that afflicted the Republic,[1] and opposing parties began to consider possible replacements for him, often considering Senator Palpatine of Naboo,[9] who was one of Valorum's oldest political friends[1] and had become a member of his inner circle.[10]
            Valorum had become embattled by 34 BBY, when the Corporate Alliance launched a blockade of the Malastare Narrows during a dispute over fuel allocations from Malastare, which appealed to the Chancellor to intervene after efforts to reach a diplomatic solution failed. Valorum feared that the Alliance could achieve victory, as the Dustig Sector Forces were weakened by corruption and neglect, so he demurred publicly while covertly convincing the neighboring Tyus and Var Hagen sectors to support Malastare. He also diverted credits to the Dugs to hire privateers and dispatched the Jedi Kep-She and an officer named Wullf Yularen to the area, ostensibly as military observers. Although the subsequent Battle of Malastare Narrows forced the Corporate Alliance to retreat, scandal ensued, embarrassing the already-troubled Valorum.[11]
            After the Dorvalla Incident in 33 BBY, on the initiative of Senator Palpatine, Valorum suggested for the taxation of Free-Trade routes to make peace with the Nebula Front who had been terrorizing the Trade Federation. The Front did not think this would make any difference and attempted to murder the Chancellor. The terrorists made two assassination attempts, both of which were foiled by the Jedi.[4]
            Shortly afterwards, Palpatine secretly funneled several million credits, believed to have been stolen by the Nebula Front, through the Bank of Aargau, and into the accounts of the Valorum family. Palpatine's aide, Sate Pestage, ensured that the exchange was uncovered by Valorum's political enemy, Senator Orn Free Taa, who revealed it to the Internal Activities Committee, thus critically weakening the Chancellor's already tenuous hold on power.[4]
            Although Valorum denied the accusations and his supporters rallied to his side, his influence and reputation languished. Correctly thinking that he could be ousted from his charge in a near future, Valorum then decided to perform one last good deed while he could, and he gathered the Coruscant security forces to fight a subversive organization known as the Flail. The Flail, who believed the Senate was corrupt, had performed several attacks, disrupting public services with no care for the lives or property lost. The Flail's members dwindled thanks to Valorum's efforts, and the main leaders of the conspiracy died in a shooting with the police. Valorum publicly promised that the remnants of the Flail would be taken to justice before the following Senate conference, which prompted the new terrorist leader, Zegmon Pent, to send Valorum death threats and vainly assault his Staff Aide Sei Taria.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Finis_Valorum/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascFinisValorum</string></dict>
        <key>Vaklu</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.860.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vaklu was an Onderonian general and commander-in-chief of Onderon's armed forces during the Mandalorian Wars, the Jedi Civil War, and the Dark Wars. During the Mandalorian Wars, Vaklu lead the resistance movement against the Mandalorian occupiers. He was loved by many, and decorated as a war hero. He gained much support from within the ranks of the military and from the populace of Onderon to seize control of the throne of Onderon from his cousin, Queen Talia. This coup d'état soon erupted into a full scale civil war. Leading the Onderon separatists, Vaklu assaulted the palace in an attempt to crush Talia once and for all. His gambit failed, and he was executed as a traitor to Onderon.
            The exact details of Vaklu's life before he entered the Onderonian military are scarce. It's a safe assumption that he was born on Onderon, and entered the military at a young age. Due to his courage and shrewd tactical mind, Vaklu soon worked his way through the ranks, and eventually rose to the rank of General.[1]
            At the start of the Mandalorian Wars, Vaklu was unable to help the Onderonian military, with its outdated tactics and equipment, prevent the Mandalorian legions, with their cutting-edge weaponry and years of fighting experience, from conquering Onderon. During the Mandalorian occupation, Vaklu was able to rally his people and lead the underground resistance movement, and greatly helped in driving the Mandalorians from Onderon, although the Mandalorians would later claim that Vaklu's triumph was due only to the Jedi and the Republic, and that their forces never gave ground to any Onderonian soldier.[1]
            After the victory against the Mandalorians, Vaklu was celebrated as a war hero and was made, due in no small part to his leadership during the resistance, the commander-in-chief of the planet's entire military. Vaklu was unable to show his skill during the Jedi Civil War, however, as Darth Revan seemed to purposefully avoid Onderon. Oddly enough, due to its diverse ecology, Onderon was necessary to seeding life on war-torn worlds, and had Revan invaded Onderon, the Onderonians might not have had their vital role in the post-war period.[1]
            After the war, Onderon began to export their ecology to the Telosian Restoration Project, a template for the restoration of all other war-ravaged planets, making Onderon a vital world. Noticing how much Onderon had given to the Republic in both the Mandalorian Wars and the post-Jedi Civil War, and how little Onderon had received in return, Vaklu became dissatisfied with the now-weakened Republic, and openly announced his desires for Onderon to secede from the Republic. In addition to being a skilled military leader, Vaklu was also a charismatic politician. This, along with his heroism during the Mandalorian Wars, allowed Vaklu's ideas to spread across Onderon and the galaxy to off-world Onderonian diplomats and businessmen. Hundreds of thousands rallied around Vaklu. However, Vaklu's cousin, Queen Talia, was a constant supporter in the Republic, and spoke against secession. Many of Vaklu's following dwindled, due to their loyalty to the queen.
            Vaklu was then driven by his love of Onderon (and his own ambitions) to take the throne from Talia, to better serve the people and give Onderon the destiny he thought it deserved. Vaklu, determined as ever to see the secession of Onderon, constantly battled Talia over the support of the Council of Lords, officers within the military, and the Onderonian people. As political animosity escalated, riots became more common. Several attempts were made on Talia's life. Although Vaklu may not have been directly responsible for these attempts, it is certain that Vaklu's more radical supporters were responsible, believing themselves to be acting on Vaklu's behalf.[1]
            The Queen stepped up security around the palace, and neighboring quarters, placing loyal officers on the Sky Ramp and the Merchant Quarter. Vaklu spread propaganda to breed distrust in the Republic. Vaklu also used his powers as commander-in-chief to pass several edicts in an attempt to sever connections to the Republic. He used the Onderonian navy to blockade the planet, thus forcing Republic trading ships to be searched in order to "search for Republic treachery". However, this just made the Republic more irritated with Onderon, and also decreased the economic benefits of Onderon being a member of the Republic. Vaklu also spread rumors of Republic spies, and used the military to seize supposed "spies", who were really, in most cases, journalists who openly criticized Vaklu, or offworlders with close ties with the Republic. Talia, having very little military influence, was powerless to stop Vaklu. With the threat of assassination looming outside the palace, Talia was unable to speak publicly to her people. Simultaneously, Vaklu began a push in the Council of Lords to take diplomatic powers away from the Queen and give it to the Council, a veiled attempt to secede from the Republic. However, Talia still had considerable influence within the Council of Lords, and many viewed it unlikely that Vaklu's movement would receive a super majority vote.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vaklu</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVaklu</string></dict>

            In 3643 BBY, Gearbox was the first of Havoc Squad to receive their new member, a promising sergeant newly arrived in Ord Mantell, briefing him in the basics. After their APC walker was shot down by Separatist rockeeters, he tried to repair the walker but failed, later moving on to Fort Garnik. He was sent on an unknown mission when the sergeant was sent to help out Havoc member Zora, nicknamed Wraith.
            After his mission on Ord Mantell, Bex believed that the Republic was becoming too corrupt and decided to defect in joining the Empire along with Harron Tavus. He was later present at the separatists' base when Havoc Squad defected. Prior to his defection, he was the technician for Havoc Squad (later replaced by Yuun). When he joined the Empire, Gearbox started "Project B" on Alderaan to create a massive assault walker. The trooper pleaded Gearbox to end this and come back to the Republic, but Bex refused and fought against the Havoc captain. He was defeated and finally came to realize that joining the Empire was his true mistake.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bex_Kolos</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBexKolos</string></dict>

Branon, sometimes known simply as John "D", was a young Human male pilot who served the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. In 0 BBY, he participated in the Battle of Yavin under the callsign Red Four.[3]
            Flying a T-65 X-wing starfighter, Branon was shot down by TIE/LN starfighters during the assault on the first Death Star, among the first pilots who were killed. He, Puck Naeco and Theron Nett were the only Rebels to die at the hands of TIE pilots during the battle, as the rest of the X- and Y-wings that fell during the battle were destroyed by Darth Vader or gunned down by turbolaser fire.
            John D. was portrayed by Jack Klaff in A New Hope. He was presumably named after John Dykstra.[4]
            Though the film credits list Jack Klaff as the actor portraying John D, the Customizable Card Game names Jack Klaff's character Lt. Naytaan. The CCG creators made an error in naming him Naytaan. According to Leland Chee, Naytaan and John D. are two different pilots.[5]
            According to Klaff, he was recorded with additional dialogue which was subsequently cut—noting that he had his first TIE fighter kill right before being shot down.[6]
            John D. has been known as "Fake Wedge" among much of the Star Wars community, because of the belief that Jack Klaff played the character of Wedge in the Rebel briefing room scene (a character played by Denis Lawson in every other scene). Pablo Hidalgo has since revealed that "Fake Wedge" was not actually portrayed by Klaff, but rather by actor Colin Higgins.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/John_D._Branon/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJohnD.Branon</string></dict>

        <key>Brrang</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.865.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brrang was a member of the Ranc gang. He served under Wenda and Bett until the former stormtrooper Terex took over the group in 7 ABY. Brrang commanded the Carrion Spike and the Ranc gang's fleet of "Uglies" during the Battle over a desert planet.[2]
            Brrang was a member of the Ranc gang during the New Republic Era, which was led by Wenda and Bett, who ran a large ship and salvage operation based on the Outer Rim world of Kaddak. In 7 ABY, he and his fellow Ranc gang associates including Wenda, Bett, Zumgi, and Wisper entered the Rothana Imperial Shipyards with the help of the former stormtrooper Terex.[1] After Terex killed Wenda, Bett, and the former stormtrooper Corlac for trying to kill him, Brrang and the other Ranc gang members transferred their allegiance to Terex, who became the Lord-General of the Ranc gang.[3]
            After Terex joined the First Order, Wisper took over leadership of the gang. In 34 ABY, Terex returned to Kaddak to retake control of the Ranc gang and use them to destroy the Resistance, an independent paramilitary faction aligned the New Republic. After Zumgi killed Wisper for contesting Terex's leadership, Brrang joined the rest of the gang in reaffirming their loyalty to Terex.[1] Brrang and Zumgi accompanied Terex aboard his flagship Carrion Spike as they embarked on their hunt for the Resistance starfighter pilot Poe Dameron, who had escaped with the BX-series droid commando N1-ZX.[2] While N1-ZX was purportedly carrying information about the First Order, this was a ruse created by Terex in order to track down and destroy the Resistance.[2]
            During the pursuit, Brrang informed Terex that Poe's T-70 X-wing starfighter was still generating a strong signal despite entering hyperspace. Terex thanked Brrang and instructed Zumgi to prepare the fleet and inform him when Poe had re-entered realspace. However, Poe figured out Terex's plan and exited hyperspace above a desert planet. Brrang then informed Terex that they were in the middle of nowhere and were receiving no readings from a base. Brrang realized that Poe had figured their plan and had deliberately led them away from the Resistance base. Terex then decided to kill Poe instead.[2]
            When Terex went down to the desert planet to pursue Poe, Brrang was placed in charge of the Carrion Spike and Terex's fleet of "Uglies". When Poe's Black Squadron arrived to rescue Poe, a Trandoshan pilot informed Brrang that reinforcements had arrived. Brrang recognized them as General Leia Organa's secret missions squad. With the Trandoshan believing their forces held a numerical advantage, Brrang ordered the Ranc fleet to destroy them in order to please Lord-General Terex.[4]
            The Ranc gang's "Uglies" attacked Black Squadron but proved inferior to the Resistance fighters. The Resistance technician and Terex's former spy Oddy Muva freed Terex's slaves including his wife Sowa Chuan and reprogrammed the Carrion Spike's computers to attack Terex's "Uglies." Brrang reacted with shock and asked his pilots what was going. One human pilot replied that they had been locked out of the control systems while the Trandoshan reported that several escape pods had escaped. Brrang and his crew eventually managed to regain control of the Carrion Spike. The Carrion Spike and the remaining "Uglies" then prepared for a final stand against Black Squadron. However, the Ranc fleet was wiped out by the First Order Commander Malarus's Maxima-A class heavy cruiser and TIE/fo space superiority fighters, who had been sent to arrest Terex for insubordination. Brrang and his crew were presumably killed.[5]
            Brrang was a human man with a wrinkled face. He wore armor and a helmet with a neck flap that covered his ears and neck. He was loyal to Terex and commanded his flagship Carrion Spike in his absence.[2]
            Brrang first appeared in the 2016 comic Poe Dameron 9: The Gathering Storm, Part II, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Phil Noto.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brrang</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBrrang</string></dict>

        <key>Braden</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.867.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Braden was a male Human bounty hunter active during the Great Galactic War and the Cold War.
            At some point during his career, Braden worked with the Trandoshan Qyzen Fess. During the Great Galactic War, Braden was on a mission hunting down the Wookiee Dalborra on Dantooine. He was observing Dalborra with electrobinoculars when he received a message on his hand-held holoprojector from his client, Commander Gin Lesl of the Republic Special Forces Division. She informed him of the Treaty of Coruscant, telling him there was a cease-fire between the reconstituted Sith Empire and the Republic and told him to call off the hunt. He refused, saying there were more sources that had put a bounty on the mighty Dalborra. Lesl, knowing that killing Dalborra would strain relationships between the two forces, ordered her pilot to fire a concussion missile barrage at Braden's coordinates. Braden survived, but his quarry found him, holding a rifle in hands.[1]
            Dalborra then escorted and placed Braden on an Sith warship that was transferring Human prisoners to Korriban. While passing through the Kuat sector of the Core Worlds, the warship they were traveling on attacked the Envoy, a Republic transport ship.[1]
            While on the Sith warship, he was held in a detention cell near the cell of Jedi Master Dar'Nala and witnessed her torture at the hands of the warship's captain. The captain wanted the Jedi to admit it was the transport ship that attacked his warship instead of the other way around. Between torture sessions, Braden asked Dar'nala why she didn't simply tell the Sith captain what he wanted to hear and she replied it was because she knew the truth, a truth that she claimed the Republic needed to know about. Being too weak to escape the Sith ship, she instead used the Force to open Braden's cell on the condition he promise to take word of the Sith's treachery back to Jedi Master Zym and Jedi Knight Satele Shan on Coruscant. He agreed and stole a Mark VI Supremacy-class starfighter from the warship's hangar. What he didn't tell the Jedi was that he intended to make a quick stop on Nar Shaddaa before traveling to Coruscant to fulfill his promise.[2]
            Braden eventually made it to Coruscant and went to the ruins of the Jedi Temple to talk to Zym, the Jedi's Grand Master. When he found Zym, he also found the Republic captain that had been responsible for his misfortune on Dantooine, and killed her. He then turned to Zym to give him Dar'nala's message, but Zym tried to arrest him for shooting the Republic captain. After being knocked against a wall, Braden fired a wrist rocket at Zym, killing the Grand Master. He left Coruscant without telling anyone that Sith Lord Darth Baras had been behind the attack on the Envoy. Meanwhile, a bomb planted by Sith agents destroyed a huge chunk of the Galactic Senate. His departure was also monitored by his perennial foe Dalborra.[2]
            Braden returned to Nar Shaddaa and informed a friend of his of the message he was going to deliver. Sometime later, Braden was tracked down and arrested by Jedi Master Orgus Din, who demanded that he tell him the name of his employer. Braden revealed that he had nothing to do with the bombing of the Senate tower and that he could help him track down the one who was disrupting the treaty, but they had to go to Dantooine. Din did as he requested, and Braden met Satele Shan, Dar'nala's former apprentice. Braden remembered that Dar'Nala also wanted Satele to know the truth, and informed her of Baras' treachery.[3]
            Braden later escaped Din's custody and finally captured Dalborra. Meanwhile, Dar'Nala was revealed to be the real villain behind the treaty's disruption and was killed.[3]
            At some point, the Trandoshan Qyzen Fess worked as a bounty hunter for Braden, but Fess eventually abandoned his service in order to hunt a rancor.
            Roughly a decade into the Cold War, Braden had found a new protege worthy to compete in the Great Hunt hosted for hunters across the galaxy. He brought his protege to Nal Hutta to be introduced to his new crew, Mako, a savvy female slicer Braden found on Nar Shaddaa, and Jory, a Nikto weapons-expert. Mako later told the bounty hunter that when Braden told her and Jory about the bounty hunter, he was grinning from ear to ear—he couldn't stop smiling, he was so happy. But while his protege was out to collect the bounty on a man named Vexx to curry the favor of Suudaa Nem'ro the Hutt, Braden and Jory were killed by Tarro Blood, a Mandalorian who was seeking to eliminate all the competition. Braden's protege and Mako discovered Blood's crime and vowed to avenge both Braden and Jory. Mako provided a proper burial for Braden and Jory while his protege managed to win the Great Hunt sponsorship.
            Braden was a bounty hunter at the time of the Great Galactic War. His possessions included double blaster pistols, a flamethrower, electrobinoculars, a set of heavy armor with a breathing tube incorporated in it, and a portable holoprojector.[1]
            Braden was featured in a development diary released by BioWare.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Braden</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBraden</string></dict>

        <key>Brakiss</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.872.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brakiss was a Human male from the planet Msst who was recruited by the Galactic Empire as a baby after being discovered to be Force-sensitive. He was trained and brainwashed by the Inquisitorius as a tool for their purposes. In 11 ABY, the remnants of the Inquisitorius discovered that Jedi Master Luke Skywalker was planning to recreate the Jedi Order from a Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. In an effort to sabotage Skywalker's efforts and steal his training methods, Brakiss' handlers installed him as a spy within the original class of the academy. Skywalker immediately surmised Brakiss' purpose, but sensing his potential in the Force, he decided to keep the young man as a student, working to turn him to the light side of the Force. Brakiss worked alongside Skywalker's original students, helping them defeat the spirit of the deceased Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun.
            Over the next three years, Brakiss continued to train on Yavin 4, absorbing as much of Skywalker's training as he could. In 14 ABY, Skywalker gave Brakiss a personalized test similar to the one that he had experienced on Dagobah under Master Yoda. Brakiss was forced to look inside himself, discovering a deep-rooted corruption and darkness that sickened him, breaking his psyche. Although Skywalker had hoped that the test would heal Brakiss, he instead ran from the encounter, frightened of what he had discovered in the test. He departed Yavin 4, badly broken and distraught and angry with his teacher. Brakiss was eventually sought out by another fallen student from Skywalker's academy, Dolph, who had styled himself as Kueller, a violent warlord from the planet Almania. Kueller recruited Brakiss into a scheme to topple the New Republic, promising that they would get their revenge on Skywalker. Brakiss was assigned to the planet Telti, taking over its droid manufacturing centers, where he installed explosives in every droid manufactured at its facilities over the next two years. The cheap prices of the droids allowed Brakiss and Kueller to disseminate bombs under their control throughout the New Republic. In 17 ABY, they initiated their plan, orchestrating bombings on the moon of Pydyr and the Senate Hall of the galactic capital of Coruscant.
            When Kueller forced a showdown with the New Republic on Almania, he was unable to defeat the Republic forces arrayed against him, and was killed by Skywalker's sister, Chief of State Leia Organa Solo. Brakiss was forced to flee during the fallout, drifting through the galaxy over the next few years. He eventually found himself in the Deep Core, working as a neutral intermediary for the replacement warlords established there. When the Imperial Remnant signed a peace treaty with the New Republic, Brakiss and the Deep Core warlords refused to honor the peace accords and formed a splinter movement known as the Second Imperium. This new movement was allegedly led by a resurrected Emperor Palpatine. Under Palpatine, Brakiss was placed in charge of developing an army of Dark Jedi and the construction of a space station known as the Shadow Academy to train his new recruits. Brakiss developed his students as a counter to Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum, and once he had built up his army, he was charged by Palpatine to attack Yavin 4 and wipe out Skywalker's Jedi Order. However, the attack was soundly defeated, and in the aftermath, Brakiss discovered that "Palpatine" was a deception perpetrated by four Imperial Royal Guards. In his pursuit of revenge on the traitorous guards, Brakiss allowed one of them to escape, and the guard activated a self-destruct mechanism of the Shadow Academy. The space station exploded in a giant fireball, killing everyone aboard, including Brakiss.
            Brakiss was a male Human born on the planet Msst,[2] a stronghold of the Galactic Empire.[12] His mother was a native of the planet and an Imperial citizen.[2] While still a baby, Brakiss was identified as Force-sensitive and was taken from his home for training.[6] His mother tried to stop the theft of her child but was unable to stop the Imperials from taking Brakiss.[2] The standing order for Force-sensitive children was to either dispose of them or mold them into tools for the Empire. Brakiss scored highly enough on his aptitude tests that the Imperials spared his life.[1] Under the Imperials, Brakiss was trained in his Force abilities for future use as an Imperial spy. To ensure Brakiss' loyalty, the Imperials threatened to kill his family if he did not cooperate.[5] Unlike other young Force-sensitives discovered by the Empire, Brakiss was not singled out for further training under Emperor Palpatine. Instead, he was given over to the Inquisitorius and their reprogramming teams, forming him into a weapon under their control.[1][7]
            Over the years, the Imperials gave Brakiss more freedom, allowing him to visit his family on occasion. However, the treatment under the Empire left Brakiss cold and emotionless. His mother sensed that her son had changed during his training, but Brakiss feigned happiness during his visits.[2] In reality, Brakiss blamed his mother for his kidnapping, never forgiving the woman who was unable to protect him from the Empire.[13] By the time of the Battle of Endor, Brakiss was still a teenager, and when the Empire splintered, Brakiss was shuttled from Msst to various warlord kingdoms, furthering the interests of his Imperial handlers. Brakiss was not involved in the Dark Empire campaign of 10 ABY, sitting out of the clone Emperor Palpatine's attempt to reconquer the galaxy.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brakiss</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBrakiss</string></dict>

At some point during his service to the Order, Bok was tasked with guarding the Jedi library on the ancient space station of Nespis VIII.
            Born into the Republic Classic era on a planet within the Galactic Republic, Aidan Bok was identified as Force-sensitive and turned over to the Jedi Temple for training in the ways of the Jedi. Eventually graduating and being selected as a Padawan by a Jedi Master, Bok traveled the galaxy until he was ready to pass the Trials of Knighthood. Once a Jedi Knight, Bok accepted solo missions from the Jedi High Council.[1]
            As the Clone Wars erupted across the Republic, the High Council assigned Bok to safeguard the Order's ancient storehouses on the Space City orbiting Nespis VIII. Remaining on the station for years, Bok was not killed during the execution of Order 66 by the Grand Army of the Republic as he was not directly involved with the war. In isolation amongst the ancient relics, Bok was eventually tracked down by the Dark Lord of the Sith called Darth Vader. Engaging the Sith in a lightsaber duel, Bok was slain and the storehouse fell to the Sith Lord and the Galactic Empire.[1]

Five years after the Empire's creation, Blista-Vanee was a relative newcomer to the Ruling Council, but proved himself useful in blazing hyperspace routes into the star systems of the galaxy's Deep Core. Along with fellow advisors Mas Amedda, Ars Dangor and Janus Greejatus, he attended a meeting between members of the council and representatives of the Empire's several intelligence agencies concerning the theft of the corvette Carrion Spike from Moff Wilhuff Tarkin by a rebel cell and its subsequent use to attack Imperial facilities. During the meeting Palpatine looked to Blista-Vanee to give details on a number of Interdictor vessels from the Deep Core Security Zone that Tarkin hoped to use to capture the stolen corvette.[2] Blista-Vanee was later among the Ruling Council members who accompanied Palpatine to the second Death Star.[1] Blista-Vanee was fond of watching opera and wore colorful clothes including flamboyant hats.[2]
            Kren Blista-Vanee first appeared as an unnamed Imperial advisor in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.[1] The character, who was portrayed by an uncredited background extra, went unnamed until the name "Kren Blista-Vanee" was used in the Star Wars Legends roleplaying game Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game supplement Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi.[3] The name was then canonized with its inclusion in James Luceno's 2014 novel Tarkin.[2]
            Blista-Vanee's costume was designed by Nilo Rodis-Jamero. Rodis-Jamero felt that the look of the Imperial advisors was one of the most exciting designs from Return of the Jedi and thought their design would need to convey an idea about the kind of world that the Emperor lived in.

        <key>Sio Bibble</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.881.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sio Bibble was the human male governor of Naboo and a member of the Royal Advisory Council during the final years of the Galactic Republic and the early days of the Galactic Empire.
            Sio Bibble was born on Naboo prior to the Invasion of Naboo.[2] Bibble was elected as the governor of Naboo during King Veruna's reign.[4] During Queen Amidala's coronation, he and the Naboo Royal Advisory Council closed the Palace Plaza for a parade.[5]
            In 32 BBY, Senator Palpatine contacted the Royal Advisory Council only to lose communication. Bibble was one of the first to suspect there would be an invasion. However, Queen Amidala refused to condone any action that would lead them to war. Later, Bibble's suspicions proved correct when Naboo was invaded by the Trade Federation. Bibble was arrested along with other people on Naboo at that time. Then, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi came to rescue them. Queen Amidala (really her decoy Sabé) agreed that she should plea to the Senate. Bibble was on high hopes that Senator Palpatine might help them.[2] However, Bibble decided to stay behind to protect his people. Later, Queen Amidala did free Naboo. Bibble attended Jinn's funeral, who was killed in the battle that liberated Naboo. Then, he attended the celebration of Naboo's victory, handing the Globe of Peace to Boss Rugor Nass.[3]
            Bibble continued to serve as governor under Amidala's successor, Queen Réillata.[6] In 22 BBY, he attended a Council meeting. They talked about how the Separatist Crisis might become a war and then redirected the conversation to Senator Amidala, who was in danger of being killed and had to hide on Naboo with a bodyguard, Anakin Skywalker.[7]
            Queen Jamillia was succeeded by Queen Neeyutnee by 21 BBY, whom Bibble also served.[8]
            In 20 BBY, he greeted Palpatine upon his return to Naboo and attended the Festival of Light. That night, bounty hunters tried to kidnap Palpatine, but their plans were thwarted by Kenobi (who was disguised as Rako Hardeen at that time). The next morning, Bibble was put in a protection group along with Queen Neeyutnee and Senator Amidala.[9]
            In 19 BBY, Bibble went with Senator Amidala to the Galactic Senate when Queen Julia of Bardotta contacted the Republic. Palpatine presented the queen the people he chose to go to Bardotta: Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and Senator Amidala of Naboo. However, the queen specifically said she wanted Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks of Naboo to go, puzzling everyone.[10]
            Sio Bibble attended the funeral of Padmé Amidala shortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire.[11] Around that time, he chose to retire as governor. However, instead of an election being held, in which former Royal Handmaiden Saché was heavily favoured to win, the Empire replaced the position with that of Imperial governor, and appointed Quarsh Panaka to the position.[6]
            Sio Bibble was a brave and defiant man in the face of great danger, like he demonstrated when Viceroy Nute Gunray from the Trade Federation invaded Theed.[3] Bibble was also known to speak his mind on several important matters like the Separatist Crisis or Gunray's constant trials in the Supreme Courts of the Galactic Republic for his actions.[7]
            More than anything, Sio Bibble cared to an extent for the safety of Queen Amidala as demonstrated during the Trade Federation's invasion at Theed.[3]
            Sio Bibble was played by Oliver Ford Davies in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.[3] Davies then reprised the role again in 2002's Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones[7] and 2005's Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.[11]
            Concept art for Sio Bibble was developed by Iain McCaig.[2] For Bibble's name, however, it was Katie Lucas, daughter of director George Lucas, the one who came up with the name.[12]
            During the principal photography of Attack of the Clones in Italy, Davies was unable to attend, as he was shooting another film and was in a play. Nine months after Episode II's principal photography had ended, Davies went to reprise the role for a scene shot on a bluescreen stage, and was then digitally inserted into the scene shot in Italy.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sio_Bibble</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSioBibble</string></dict>

            Belos had a very opportunistic mind and was always looking to cut a better deal. When agents of Imperial Intelligence approached the Council with their offer to join the Empire amid promises of rich rewards, Belos, believing the Empire's superior military might would allow it to overwhelm the Republic, voted to join the winning side. But when the civil uprising against the Sith Empire gained the support of the Jedi and the Galactic Republic, Belos understood that the wind was changing and offered his secret support to the Republic Command, aiding them in eliminating many Imperial strongholds, thereby saving his life from accusations of treason.
            Belos reached out to the Republic, providing them intel to help them push the Empire off Corellia, as well as orchestrating the deaths of Darth Acharon, Darth Hadra and Darth Decimus. Belos also joined the heroes of the Republic in a holoconference with Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh and the Galactic Senate. Belos explained the reasons behind Corellian Council's actions and promised that, if he was allowed to stay in office, he would dedicate the rest of his term to redeeming himself. Saresh expressed hesitancy to trust him, as he could betray Corellia to the Empire again. However, a Republic hero spoke in favor of Belos, pointing out that he risked his life to help them.

        <key>Tobias Beckett</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.883.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tobias Beckett was a human male professional thief who worked for the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate during the era of the Galactic Empire. A native of Glee Anselm, Beckett organized a crew to help with his heist missions. Although he became a mentor to Han Solo, a young mudtrooper who joined Beckett's group, Beckett was a survivor who quietly worked out angles that enabled him to come out ahead. He made use of many blasters, including the RSKF-44 heavy blaster and DG-29 heavy blaster pistol. He also owned a DL-44 heavy blaster pistol before he gave it to Solo.
            Tobias Beckett was born on the planet Glee Anselm.[1] At some point before 10 BBY, he met the bounty hunter Aurra Sing and pushed her to her death. Sing's death was later recalled to Beckett while talking with Lando Calrissian, though Beckett claimed that he just pushed Sing and that it was the fall that killed her.[2]
            Beckett and his gang went to Hovun IV on a mission for Crimson Dawn. There, Beckett, posing as a Death priest, pretended to Force choke Rio Durant in order to scare several sabacc players away from Durant's game. After the players left, Beckett congratulated Durant on pulling off the trick. Beckett asked Val if she placed the tracker on Dvorad, and she said she did. Beckett and his gang went to the dock to find Dvorad in order to steal identichips. Beckett was able to jump onto Dvorad's speeder, punched him, and made it to Dvorad's ship.[4]
            Beckett and his gang were held at gunpoint by Dvorad and his ship until a creature attacked. As his gang and Dvorad fought the creature, Beckett boarded the ship and fought his way past Dvorad's guards. Aboard, Beckett was able to find the the chips and make his way back to Val and Durant in order to make their escape before the creature pulled Dvorad's ship into the depths. As they left, Beckett shot down Durant's idea about keeping some of the chips for themselves instead of giving all of them to Crimson Dawn's leader, Dryden Vos. Beckett then summoned the Rampart and left Hovun IV.[4]
            As the Rampart made its way to Munt Ontdal, Beckett tried to think of a way to leave Crimson Dawn. After landing on Munt Ontdal, Beckett took his speeder to meet with Vos. However, he came under attack by several knife-wielding thieves. Beckett, seeing it as as a setup, tried to escape but was knocked out by Enfys Nest, leader of the Cloud-Riders. Despite knowing Vos would arrive shortly, Beckett was told by Val that Nest faked the mission. Beckett, to prevent Nest from getting the chips, blew them and the Rampart up. Despite wanting to finish Nest off, Beckett was convinced to let them go for the day. As Beckett and his gang were confronted by several stormtroopers, he lied to them by saying that the explosion was caused by black market radioactive fuel. Beckett, Val, and Durant then decided to resume their death priest scheme.[4]
            Sometime later the crew traveled to Mimban where the Galactic Empire was engaged in a campaign with the Mimbanese Liberation Army. Beckett disguised himself as a captain of the Imperial Army. At some point during the battle, Beckett asked who was in charge, since their commanding officer had recently perished. Han Solo, a mudtrooper with the 224th Imperial Armored Division, informed Beckett that he was in fact the ranking officer. Beckett led his men through the battle. While observing an AT-hauler, he met the young Solo, who wanted to join them as part of their crew. Durant had doubts about letting Solo join them, but Beckett decided to give the boy an opportunity by leading him to be locked up for desertion. Solo was put in a chamber, where he was to be fed to the Wookiee Chewbacca. Solo ultimately was able to escape with Chewbacca, who initially intended to devour Solo. Beckett left with his crew, stealing the AT-hauler they observed earlier, but while in mid-takeoff they found Solo and Chewbacca running towards them, waving for them to let them onto the ship. Beckett ordered Durant to lower the hauler to let Solo and Chewbacca board.[2]
            Beckett was instructed to retrieve a crate of coaxium from a 20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport on the planet Vandor; he went on this mission with Val, Durant, Solo and Chewbacca.[2]
            Upon arriving at Vandor, the crew ate dinner over a campfire and had a brief conversation about Solo's and Chewbacca's motivation for participating in the mission. Solo simply stated that there was someone he left on Corellia and that he wanted to return there to free her from her horrible life there. Val stated that everyone needed someone, even Beckett. Beckett began deconstructing one of his blasters and chucked it to Solo[2]
            In the morning, Beckett, Val and Solo observed the transport carrying the coaxium as well as some patrolling viper droids, while discussing the plan for the heist. The conveyex was moving towards a bridge over a ravine. The plan was for Val to place explosives on the supports of the bridge. The other members of the crew were to board the conveyex and attach cables from the carriage which contained the coaxium to their ship. Then, as the conveyex neared the bridge, Val was to destroy the bridge while the crew disconnected the coaxium carriage from the rest of the conveyex, allowing the ship to lift the target carriage away while the rest of the conveyex fell to the bottom of the ravine. Val noted that if the viper droids were alerted, the heist would become much more difficult, prompting Solo to also survey the viper droids.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tobias_Beckett</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTobiasBeckett</string></dict>
        <key>Garm Bel Iblis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.884.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Garm Bel Iblis was a male Human senator representing Corellia in the Galactic Senate during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Charismatic and independent, he strongly opposed the power being gradually built by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and invoked an ancient Corellian proviso in order to keep his homeworld out of the Clone Wars. When Palpatine reorganized the Republic into a Galactic Empire and declared himself Emperor in 19 BBY, Bel Iblis served in the Imperial Senate, but continued to publicly speak out against the man in spite of strains that it placed on his marriage with a pro-Imperial wife. When agents of the Empire murdered his wife and children, the Senator went into hiding and founded a militaristic resistance movement with which to fight the Imperial war machine. Although Bel Iblis was a skilled military leader, he saw the need to merge his rebellion with other resistance movements, and, after being rescued from the clutches of a bounty hunter by Galen Marek, invited the Alderaanian and Chandrilan Senators Bail Organa and Mon Mothma to Corellia, at a meeting where a Rebel Alliance was formally declared. The meeting was interrupted, by the Emperor's apprentice Darth Vader, whom Marek had secretly been working for. The rebel leaders were taken to the Empire's superweapon, the Death Star, but were freed by Marek in an act of rebellion against his master, and began operating the Rebel Alliance.
            When Organa was killed in 0 BBY, tensions that had been escalating between Bel Iblis and Mothma came to a climax, and the Corellian left the Rebellion, forming his own private war against the Empire. Remaining mobile, the movement performed hit-and-run tactics against the Empire for years, and was eventually strengthened by six Dreadnaughts from the fabled Katana fleet. When the Empire was overthrown and the Rebellion became a New Republic, Bel Iblis remained in hiding, expecting a power-hungry Mothma to declare herself Empress. On assignment for the New Republic, Han Solo and Lando Calrissian discovered his base in 9 ABY, and convinced him to aid their government in its conflict with the resurgent Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn. Bel Iblis joined the New Republic's military as a General and proved vital in several battles; he made amends with Mothma, swallowing his trademark pride and becoming a permanent fixture in New Republic High Command, leading a retreat from Coruscant and doing battle with forces of a reborn Palpatine and later Admiral Daala.
            When the Caamas Document Crisis erupted in 19 ABY, Bel Iblis was in command of a small fleet and the elite starfighter unit Rogue Squadron, and used his forces to mediate growing conflicts between feuding New Republic member states. When he was too late to stop a Leresai fleet from destroying a Bothan space station, he grew furious, and was reassigned to the important task of obtaining a complete copy of the Caamas Document from an Imperial Ubiqtorate base at Yaga Minor. Securing the services of the smuggler Booster Terrik and his Star Destroyer, the Errant Venture, he attacked the base, but his forces were caught in tractor beams and trapped by Imperial reinforcements. They were saved, however, and the crisis averted, when information quickly arrived revealing two of the Imperial leaders to be frauds, concurrently with a copy of the Caamas Document being discovered on Nirauan. The galaxy was finally at peace, and Bel Iblis retired, only to return to the military when an extragalactic race of religious zealots known as the Yuuzhan Vong began conquering the galaxy. Bel Iblis played pivotal roles in key victories at Ebaq 9, Duro, Bilbringi, and Coruscant, and the invaders were eventually defeated.
            The male Human Garm Bel Iblis was born on the planet Corellia during the waning days of the Galactic Republic. He was extremely patriotic, toward both Corellia[9] and the Republic,[10] and was said to embody the Corellian spirit of independence.[9] Bel Iblis served in the military for a time, learning how to operate blasters and rudimentary weaponry.[11] In 35 BBY,[12] he was elected as Corellia's representative in the Galactic Senate,[3] proving to be a popular and charismatic leader and making many allies in the Senate.[13] Among them was Fang Zar, the Senator of Sern sector, who was a close friend to Bel Iblis and shared his views on a great many things.[6][14] As a young and idealistic Senator, Bel Iblis was determined to preserve freedom throughout the galaxy.[10] He married a woman named Arrianya, who bore two of his children. His Senatorial aide was Sena Leikvold Midanyl, whom Bel Iblis was very close to.[11]
            Bel Iblis was one of few voices to speak out against Palpatine, a charismatic Senator[10] from Naboo[15] who ultimately became Supreme Chancellor of the Republic in 32 BBY.[16] When the threat of Count Dooku's secessionist Confederacy of Independent Systems caused Palpatine to enact the Emergency Powers Act in 24 BBY, eliminating Chancellor term times,[17] Bel Iblis began to grow more concerned with the Chancellor. He saw the[13] Naboo man[15] as a force of destruction, and suspected that Palpatine would not relinquish his power unless it was wrestled from him. Bel Iblis raised his concerns with many of his peers in the Senate, and was initially successful until Palpatine bit back, doing his part to discredit Bel Iblis and lose him influence in the Senate.[13] Two years after Palpatine had been granted Emergency Powers, many systems were seceding to the Confederacy, and the Supreme Chancellor scheduled a vote on the greatly debated Military Creation Act for two months' time. The Act would allow the formation of an Army of the Republic—something which had not existed in nearly a thousand years—to be used against the Confederacy should a war break out.[18] Bel Iblis was a strong opponent of the Act; while many of his fellow Senators, such as Tendau Bendon, opposed based on purely ideological grounds, Bel Iblis was also more pragmatic about the situation. He asked HoloNet News reporters how exactly such a military would be funded, and stated that he would not allow the Corellian taxpayer to fund both the Republic army and the Corellian Security Force.[19] Bel Iblis continued to be an outspoken critic of the impending vote for weeks in the Senate, as was the entirety of Corellia.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Garm_Bel_Iblis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGarmBelIblis</string></dict>
        <key>Soon Bayts</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.885.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Soon Bayts was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order the last decades of the Republic Classic era. When the Yinchorri Uprising came to bear, Bayts was charged with supervising communications between the Jedi strike teams and the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. When the temple was attacked by Yinchorri raiders during the Uprising, Bayts fought alongside his fellow Jedi to defend his home.
            By the time of the Clone Wars, Bayts was a Master, and he joined Mace Windu in accompanying Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan to the Outer Rim Territories on the Intervention. Following a rugged crash landing on Boz Pity, Master Bayts was among the advance group scouting for Confederate installations on the planet. Upon reaching the base, they were met with heavy droid resistance, as well as the presence of General Grievous. Before Bayts even had a chance to attack Grievous, the droid general swiftly killed the Jedi Master by crushing his skull.
            During the Yinchorri Uprising of 33 BBY, the Human male Jedi Knight Soon Bayts was tasked with keeping track of the Jedi strike teams sent to the Yinchorri system. When the Jedi Temple on Coruscant was attacked, Bayts fought alongside the other Jedi to defend it from the Yinchorri threat. Following the battle, he received word from Masters Eeth Koth and Adi Gallia, determining that Yinchorri command was not located on Yitheeth as had been suspected. He also learned that Mace Windu's strike team had not engaged the opposition, and was lying in wait on Yinchorr. Delivering this news to Yoda, he encountered the Grand Master interrogating a Yinchorri survivor of the battle.[3]
            Bayts was curious as to how Yoda had made the prisoner so fearful, but the Grand Master explained that the warrior had brought the fear with him when he attacked the temple, and that he had simply shown him the reality of it. While Bayts delivered his message, the warrior made to attack Yoda, inciting the younger Jedi to leap to the Grand Master's aid. Yoda, however, simply levitated Bayts as he deflected the warrior's attack, and shoved the warrior into the wall, incapacitating him. Yoda then reprimanded Bayts, telling him that emotion had clouded his judgment.[3]
            Shortly thereafter, Bayts received further reports from the Yinchorri system: All three strike teams had rendezvoused on Yinchorr, and a Devaronian prisoner had been taken. Upon delivering the news to Yoda, Bayts speculated that the Devaronians might have been behind the mysterious uprising. Later, Master Windu called with urgent news about the Yinchorri command center's location, and Bayts once again had to rush into Yoda's presence, alerting him to the situation. The uprising was eventually quelled thanks to the efforts of the strike teams, though three Jedi perished in the conflict.[3]
            By the time of the Clone Wars, Soon Bayts had ascended to the rank of Jedi Master. For unknown reasons, he changed the color of his lightsaber blade from orange to blue. Along with Mace Windu and several of the Jedi, among them veterans of the Yinchorri Uprising, he accompanied Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan on the Venator-class Star Destroyer Intervention, bound for the Outer Rim Territories. Alderaan had many ties to the Outer Rim worlds, and when Organa learned that the Confederacy of Independent Systems was retreating there, he felt the need to witness the battles firsthand.[2]
            Based on intelligence from Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Intervention journeyed to Boz Pity, where a large Confederate blockade was known to be amassing. Since they were but one ship against an entire flotilla, the Jedi enlisted Anakin Skywalker, to help pilot the capital ship through the blockade, resulting in a crash landing on the planet's surface. Master Bayts ventured out with Senator Organa and a detachment of clone troopers.[2]
            The group met heavy resistance at the Confederate base, fighting off hordes of battle droids. Organa called for a charge, and Bayts obliged. As Bayts cut his way through to the opening of the base, he encountered the Kaleesh cyborg General Grievous. Before Bayts could even attack the general, Grievous grasped his head with one of his mechanical claws, and crushed it, killing the Jedi Master instantly. The General then took Bayts' lightsaber, and used it to attack Republic troops. The Battle of Boz Pity was eventually won by the Republic, however.[2]
            Soon Bayts was a prompt individual, and always made sure that his superiors were well informed with the intelligence he gleaned as supervisor of communications during the Yinchorri uprising. He was able to survive the Yinchorri attack, and readily went to Master Yoda's aid, even when he did not need it. He acted on emotion, rather than instinct; a trait that Yoda openly criticized. Though Bayts' combat skills served him well during the Yinchorri conflict, they did not match those of General Grievous, who killed the Jedi Master without difficulty.[2][3]
            Soon Bayts was created by Randy Stradley, and first appeared in the comic mini-series Jedi Council: Acts of War. In it, the character appears in a minor supporting role. Bayts' name was intended as a pun on the term "masturbates"; a pun later illustrated by Haden Blackman in Star Wars: Obsession. Stradley had initially planned to use the name as a practical joke on Comic Editor at Lucas Licensing Sue Rostoni, who would often put the word "Master" in front of any Jedi's name. Stradley created Bayts as an unimportant tertiary character simply to play a joke on Rostoni, but the character made it through to publication.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Soon_Bayts</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSoonBayts</string></dict>

He was trained in capital ship piloting and tactics at the Imperial Training Academy on Raithal, and he eventually rose to the rank of warrant officer. In 3 ABY, Bachenkall was present in the crewpits of the Executor, serving under Lieutenant Commander Ardan, when Darth Vader entered the bridge to discuss the findings of a Viper probe droid. The droid had discovered the location of Echo Base, the Rebel Alliance's headquarters in the Hoth system.
            The Human male Bachenkall served in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War. He graduated from the Imperial Training Academy on the planet Raithal, a naval school that trained pilots in capital starship helm tactics. By early 3 ABY, Bachenkall had risen to the rank of warrant officer and served with the Imperial Death Squadron aboard the Star Dreadnought Executor, the personal flagship of Lord Darth Vader, as a helmsman under Lieutenant Commander Ardan's supervision.[1]
            In 3 ABY, Bachenkall was present within the Executor's starboard command pit when Vader strode across the bridge's command walkway to discuss the findings of a Viper probe droid in the Hoth system with Fleet Admiral Kendal Ozzel and Captain Firmus Piett. Along with the rest of the crewmen within the command pit, Bachenkall watched in fearful silence as the Dark Lord passed above them. The probe droid's data revealed the location of Echo Base, the Rebel Alliance's headquarters on the planet Hoth, leading to the Executor's participation in the subsequent Battle of Hoth.[2][3]
            Bachenkall was typical of graduates of the Empire's Training Academy on Raithal,[4] where he was trained in capital starship helm tactics.[1] Bachenkall and the other members of the pit crew displayed fearful deference at the presence of Darth Vader as he stalked across the upper command walkway of the Executor's bridge to learn of the Viper probe droid's report in the Hoth system.[2][3]
            Bachenkall made his first appearance in the film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back as an unidentified extra among Darth Vader's bridge crew.[2] The character's name and elements of his backstory were introduced in the Dagobah Limited expansion set of Decipher, Inc.'s Star Wars Customizable Card Game, released in April 1997,[1] and he later garnered an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, released on December 9, 2008.[4]
            The character name "Bachenkall" is an anagram of Decipher game playtester Chuck Kallenbach.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bachenkall</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBachenkall</string></dict>

In 3 ABY, he was part of the forces serving under the Sith Lord Darth Vader that occupied Cloud City on the planet Bespin in order to capture the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. Bewil informed Vader when Skywalker's X-wing starfighter was sighted approaching the city and was present in Cloud City's carbon-freeze chamber when Skywalker's companion Han Solo was frozen in carbonite.
            The human male Bewil served the Galactic Empire as a captain[2] during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[1] In 3 ABY,[3] he was amongst the Imperial forces led by Sith Lord Darth Vader in the occupied Cloud City on the planet Bespin. Vader's aim was to capture the crew of the rebel YT-1300 light freighter, the Millennium Falcon, and them use them as bait as part of a larger trap for their comrade, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker.[1]
            Vader successfully captured the Falcon's crew with aid from the bounty hunter Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian, Baron Administrator of Cloud City. The Sith then viewed the city's carbon-freezing chamber, where he hoped to freeze Skywalker for transportation to the Galactic Emperor, Sheev Palpatine. Bewil approached Vader in the chamber and informed him that Skywalker's T-65B X-wing starfighter had been spotted approaching Cloud City. Vader ordered that the captain monitor the Jedi and allow him to land.[1]
            Vader decided to test the carbon-freezing process before using it on Skywalker to ensure that it would not kill the Jedi, and ordered that the Falcon's captain Han Solo be frozen first. Bewil stood by in the chamber and observed Solo being lowered down and frozen. Once the process was complete and Calrissian had confirmed that Solo had survived the process, Bewil approached Vader and informed him that Skywalker had landed.[1]
            The Sith ordered Bewil to make sure that the Jedi found his way to the freezing chamber, and the captain left to carry out the orders. Skywalker was ultimately lured into the chamber while trying to rescue the his friends, but managed to escape from Vader and leave Cloud City on the Falcon with its crew and Calrissian, who had betrayed the Empire.[1]
            Bewil had brown hair and light skin.[1]
            While in Cloud City, Bewil wore a gray Imperial uniform with a cap and a black belt, gloves and boots.[1]
            Bewil first appeared in the 1980 original trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, in which he was portrayed uncredited[1] by Milton Johns. In the current canon, Bewil's name was first used in the Star Wars Black &amp; White: The Empire Strikes Back set of trading cards released by The Topps Company, Inc. in 2018.[2]
            The name was originally first used in the Star Wars Legends "Cloud City Limited" set of cards released for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game in 1997.[4] According to a Star Wars CCG fan site, Bewil was named as an anagram of Decipher game designer Sandy Wible.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bewil</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBewil</string></dict>

        <key>Mungo Baobab</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.893.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mungo Baobab was a male Human merchant from Manda. During his youth, Baobab displayed a love of travel and adventure which left the family elders concerned about his suitability as heir to the famous Baobab Merchant Fleet. In 15 BBY, seeking to teach him some responsibility, the family dispatched him to establish a trading post on the planet Biitu, along with his droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. However, shortly after he arrived, the planet was invaded by Imperial forces under the command of the Great Heep and Baobab was taken prisoner. Escaping with the help of the young Biituian Fidge Tadrazan, Baobab and the droids helped to destroy the Great Heep and free the people of Biitu from the Empire.
            Despite the new trading post on Biitu, the rise of the Galactic Empire had left the Baobab Merchant Fleet facing financial ruin and Baobab determined to save it by establishing a trade route to the planet Roon, source of the valuable Roonstones. Baobab made the journey through the Cloak of the Sith to the Roon system but his quest soon came to the attention of Governor Bisad Koong of Roon's Tawntoom province, who was negotiating to supply Roonstones to the Empire's Admiral Terrinald Screed. During his time on Roon, Baobab encountered Auren Yomm, a resident of the rebellious Umboo province. Yomm aided Baobab in his search for Roonstones and the two soon developed an attraction. When Auren and her doctor father, Nilz, were kidnapped by Koong, who was hoping that Nilz could cure him of the rooze disease, Baobab set off to the Fortress of Tawntoom to rescue them. In so doing, he discovered the source of the Roonstones—in the walls of the volcano beneath the fortress. Baobab escaped with the Yomms, but his fortune appeared lost when Koong destroyed the Roonstones to prevent the Empire stealing them.
            After securing financial backing, Baobab was able to find an alternate source of Roonstones and established a trade route between Roon and Manda which revived his family's fortunes. He eventually married Yomm and took over the Merchant Fleet, overseeing the business from his home in the Roon system. Years later, he helped his friend Lando Calrissian to capture the bounty hunter Thune.
            Mungo Baobab was born into the wealthy Baobab family on Manda[1] around 45 BBY.[2] The Baobab family was well respected in many sectors of the galaxy due to their Baobab Merchant Fleet, which had a reputation as one of the Galactic Republic's most reliable shippers, and the extensive library located at the Baobab Archives on Manda.[1] Baobab's father managed the Merchant Fleet[4] and, as heir to the dynasty, the young Baobab was expected to one day take over running the family business. However, Baobab seemed incapable of focusing on the business,[1] instead focusing on his love of travel and adventure.[5] On one journey to Socorro, Baobab met the young Lando Calrissian and the two became friends. From Calrissian, Baobab acquired the nickname "the Wook," a reference to his long, unmanageable beard which Calrissian frequently encouraged him to have styled. After much resistance, Baobab finally agreed and started wearing his beard shorter.[3]
            The family elders became increasingly concerned about Baobab's attitude in light of the rise of the Galactic Empire and the events following the dissolution of the Trade Federation after the Clone Wars concluded[1] in 19 BBY.[6] The Empire favored pro-Imperial shipping firms and the fiercely independent Baobabs struggled to be awarded contracts. Their position in the industry was shaken as a result.[1] In 15 BBY,[7] the Baobab elders decided to attempt to instill a sense of respectability and hard work in Baobab by sending him to the planet Biitu to establish a trading post[1] and fuel ore mining operation.[8] While staying at the spaceport hotel on Manda, Baobab encountered the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, who had been working at the hotel since they were dropped off on the planet by their former owner, Jann Tosh, on his way to join the Imperial Academy. Before leaving, Baobab decided to purchase the two droids,[9] enlisting C-3PO as his personal aide and translator.[10]
            Baobab soon departed for Biitu, arranging for Captain Cag to bring his new droids to him later aboard the Argo Moon. While he conducted his search for a suitable location for the mine, he quickly developed a friendship with the native Biituians and resolved to develop his mining operation to provide the inhabitants with a fair share of the profits. Baobab eventually discovered a large source of fuel ore near some old ruins on a crater near the Biituian settlement. However, as he returned to town with a sample for analysis, an Imperial vessel descended above the settlement, causing a large storm which uprooted trees and sucked all water from the nearby river. As the scared natives began to flee, Baobab attempted to get the Biituian child Fidge Tadrazan and his pet Chubb safely to his ship, but was struck by some falling debris and knocked unconscious.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mungo_Baobab</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMungoBaobab</string></dict>
        <key>Pell Baylo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.894.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Pell Baylo was a male human who operated the Defiance Flight Training Institute for nearly fifty years, both under the Galactic Republic and its successor state, the Galactic Empire. Baylo's life ended when he tried to assassinate Emperor Palpatine by plunging the starship Defiance into Christophsis's sun. The Emperor's enforcer, Darth Vader, managed to foil his plan and strangled the old man to death.
            Pell Baylo was born over 84 years before the Battle of Yavin.[1] During the last decades of the Galactic Republic, he created the Defiance Flight Training Institute. With the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Baylo's institute was brought under the direct authority of the Republic. When that government was reorganized into an authoritarian Galactic Empire at the end of the war, Baylo continued to serve for a time, although reluctantly, with the title of Commandant.[2]
            Eventually, Baylo plotted against Emperor Palpatine. One day, the Emperor elected to meet several of his naval chiefs on the starship Defiance, and he brought his personal enforcer, a black-armored man called Darth Vader. Baylo programmed the Defiance so that it would emerge from hyperspace around the planet Christophsis and plunge into its sun, which would cause the Emperor's demise. The Commandant then confronted Palpatine in his office, tendering his resignation.[2]
            However, Baylo's plan had failed, as Darth Vader had seen through his ruse and countermanded the Commandant's orders; when the Defiance reverted to realspace, there were still millions of kilometers between the ship and the star of Christophsis. With his plan thwarted, Baylo expressed his disgust of Palpatine and his methods. When Baylo compared the Emperor's minions to mindless robots in front of Vader, the Commandant made his last mistake. Vader, who was a cyborg himself, Force choked the old man to death.[2]
            Following Baylo's execution, his body was unceremoniously thrown out of the airlock with the ship's refuse.[3] His training vessel Defiance was renamed Obedience.[2] Despite chafing under the harsh discipline of Baylo, years later, one of his former cadets Rae Sloane looked back favorably on his advice to remain stoic and expressionless in the presence of her bridge crew to avoid demoralizing them. This advice served Admiral Sloane well when she commanded the Imperial Star Destroyer Vigilance during the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY.[3]
            A male human, Baylo had a stumpy body, fair skin, brown eyes, and a long nose. In his old age, his hair had turned gray, and the sequela of a spine injury gave him an exaggerated limp.[2]
            Although he was cantakerous and sometimes foul-mouthed, Baylo had high ideals. He regarded naval service as a noble calling, thinking that navies should only be used to protect people, never as an offensive force. Baylo had an almost mythical status among his students and other members of the Imperial navy. He had become famous fighting pilots on the Defiance, and his constant battle with pain due to injuries sustained in those battles was seen as bravery.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pell_Baylo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascPellBaylo</string></dict>

        <key>Bala-Tik</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.897.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bala-Tik was a human male who worked as a negotiator for the Guavian Death Gang. He handled a deal with the famed smuggler Han Solo by paying for Solo to haul rathtars, a deal that Solo also made with Kanjiklub.
            The human male Bala-Tik served the criminal Guavian Death Gang[4] as a leader[5] and frontman during the reign of the New Republic. During his time with the gang, he encountered the smuggler Han Solo and managed to shake several profitable leads out of him,[4] although Solo let the Guavians down at least once.[2] The smuggler eventually took out a loan of fifty thousand credits from the gang in order to hunt rathtars for King Prana; however, he failed to pay it back within a timely manner and the leaders of the gang soon became tired of his delays and excuses.[4] Less than a year before the First Order's attack on the village of Tuanul in 34 ABY,[6] Bala-Tik was on the planet Kaddak on the forty-fifth level of the city known as the Sliver with three Guavian security soldiers.[7]
            While in the Sliver, the Guavians were approached by four members of Kanjiklub,[7] a criminal group with whom the gang were often in conflict.[4] Kanjiklub's leader, Tasu Leech,[4][7] had overheard the protocol droid C-3PO mention that Solo had borrowed money from the Guavian Death Gang,[7] and revealed to Bala-Tik that the smuggler had also borrowed fifty thousand credits from Kanjiklub to hunt rathar. The two groups of criminals found common ground in their hatred of Solo and agreed to confront him together over his debts,[4] with Leech and Bala-Tik shaking hands on the agreement.[7]
            In 34 ABY, Bala-Tik and a group of security soldiers caught up with Solo while he was hunting on the planet Nantoon and then followed him[4] in a nonmilitary transport[5] when he left the world in his Baleen-class heavy freighter Eravana.[4] Solo, who was unaware of the criminals pursuing him, traveled to the Western Reaches in order to locate his old YT-1300 light freighter the Millennium Falcon. The Eravana stopped in the Jakku system, where a tracker onboard the Falcon had signalled from, and managed to pick up the freighter. Shortly after the Falcon was pulled onboard the Eravana, Bala-Tik and the Guavians revealed themselves by docking with Solo's freighter.[2]
            Bala-Tik and a five-man team of security soldiers disembarked their ship and began marching through the ship until they found Solo and his co-pilot Chewbacca in one of the Eravana's corridors. The frontman demanded Solo repay them their money, also revealing that he knew about the loan from Kanjklub. The smuggler claimed Kanjiklub were lying, to which Bala-Tik responded that Solo could tell that to the group himself. Five members of Kanjiklub then revealed themselves in the corridor behind Solo, led by Leech. The smuggler promised both groups that he would deliver what he owed them, but Bala-Tik and Leech were unimpressed due to his previous work for them.[2]
            Bala-Tik then noticed the BB-series astromech droid BB-8, who was hiding between Solo and Chewbacca. Remembering that the group known as the First Order was searching for a similar BB unit and two fugitives, Bala-Tik pointed out BB-8, causing Kanjiklub to start searching the ship for the fugitives. Before Bala-Tik could make a move for the droid, the three rathtars that Solo had caught on Nantoon were set free by Rey and Finn, the two fugitives that Bala-Tik had mentioned who had been on the Falcon when Solo found it. Hearing the rathtars roar, Bala-Tik ordered his men to kill Solo and Chewbacca and grab BB-8; however, one of the rathtars attacked his team from behind before they could open fire[2] and grabbed two of the soldiers.[5]
            Bala-Tik and his remaining men fled forward toward Solo and then down a corridor to their left[2] while the rathtar killed the pair it had grabbed.[5] Kanjiklub were also attacked by a rathtar and forced to flee, allowing Solo and his companions to escape.[2] Bala-Tik managed to regroup with one member of his gang in one of the ship's corridors to take account of their losses, although as he spoke the frontman witnessed a third member of his gang being killed by a rathtar and was forced to flee while firing ineffectually at the beast.[5] Solo managed to reach the Falcon with Chewbacca, BB-8, Finn, and Rey and then escape onboard it, killing one of the rathtars in the process. Bala-Tik witnessed the Falcon depart through one of the Eravana's hangar doors and then gave orders via comlink that his men should contact the First Order and warn them that Solo had the droid.[2]
            Bala-Tik stood 1.8 meters tall[3] and had fair skin, brown eyes and brown hair. He spoke with a harsher form of the clipped accent commonly found in the galactic Core Worlds. He had a cybernetic left leg, which he concealed. Bala-Tik frequently used Solo and Chewbacca as sources of information, a relationship that he valued for the Death Gang despite growing increasingly impatient with the Corellian smuggler's schemes. He knew enough about Solo to bring several guards with him aboard the Eravana, believing Solo to be foolish enough to start a blaster fight near a ship's airlock.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bala-Tik</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBalaTik</string></dict>

After receiving training at the Prefsbelt Imperial Academy from Baron Soontir Fel, DS-181-3 flew as Fel's wingman in Saber Squadron, part of the 181st Imperial Fighter Group, and was given the nickname "Fel's Wrath." In 4 ABY, DS-181-3 was present for Sith Lord Darth Vader's arrival aboard the second Death Star, and he later participated in the Battle of Endor.
            The Human male designated DS-181-3 was a starfighter pilot in the Imperial Navy during the Galactic Civil War. Studying under renowned pilot Baron Soontir Fel at the Prefsbelt Imperial Academy, DS-181-3 went on to serve as Fel's wingman in Saber Squadron—part of the 181st Imperial Fighter Group—piloting the TIE/IN interceptor Saber 3.[1] Regularly ordered to remain at a distance from Fel to allow the Baron room to maneuver during combat,[3] DS-181-3 was given the nickname "Fel's Wrath."[4]
            In 4 ABY, DS-181-3 was present when Sith Lord Darth Vader arrived aboard the second Death Star to discuss the battlestation's lagging construction schedule with the station's commander, Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod. The Sith Lord announced that Emperor Palpatine himself would be arriving to personally oversee the remainder of the Death Star's assembly.[2] DS-181-3 later flew on Fel's wing during the Battle of Endor,[4] which ended in an Imperial defeat and the destruction of the second Death Star.[5]
            Trained by the Empire's most successful pilot, Baron Soontir Fel,[4] DS-181-3 earned a place as Fel's wingman in Saber Squadron. In combat, DS-181-3 would watch the Baron's back,[1] though he was often ordered to remain at a distance to allow Fel to maneuver.[3] DS-181-3 had black hair and light skin.[1]
            During his Imperial service, DS-181-3 wore a black Imperial Navy crewman's uniform.[1]
            DS-181-3 first appeared in the opening scene of 1983's Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi as an unnamed background character awaiting the arrival of Darth Vader on the second Death Star.[2] The character's name and elements of his backstory were introduced in the Death Star II Limited expansion set of Decipher, Inc.'s Star Wars Customizable Card Game, released in July 2000,[1] and he later garnered an entry in The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, released on December 9, 2008.[4]
            Because part of the scene showing Vader's arrival on the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi was reused in the Special Edition release of The Empire Strikes Back for a scene showing Vader arriving aboard the Executor from Bespin, the actor who portrayed DS-181-3 can be seen in the Special Edition version of The Empire Strikes Back, alongside other extras who portrayed Imperial officers in Return of the Jedi.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/DS-181-3</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDS1813</string></dict>

The day after Ahuff handed over the hyperdrive, he was brought the real head as well. Risha and her smuggler cohort needed the hyperdrive to beat Skavak, and had to convince Ahuff that he was conned.

        <key>Atin Skirata</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.903.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>RC-3222, also known as Atin (pronounced /aah-TEEN/), the Mando'a word for "persistent", or "stubborn", was a clone commando in the Galactic Republic's Omega Squad during the Clone Wars. He was trained by Sergeant Walon Vau.
            During his training, Atin gained several scars from battle. These were partly due to the regular training, but also for another reason: Walon Vau. Vau was a ruthless training sergeant, making his soldiers fight each other, or fight him. Vau made Atin choose after he lost his first squad, who were killed in training while trying to rescue him. Atin did not want to fight his brother clones, and instead opted to fight Vau. Vau nearly killed Atin with a Mandalorian saber. Vau's training was brutal, and Kal Skirata saw him as a sadist. He went on to join Prudii Squad.
            He was a former member of Prudii Squad,[1] whose other members died at the Battle of Geonosis, leaving him to be reassigned. To get Atin out of his survivor's guilt after his squadmates died, Vau took his knife to the clone, leaving a scar that stretched from his right eye to the left side of his chin, distinguishing him from his fellow clones. Atin soon after became part of the newly formed Omega Squad, along with three other clones who had lost the rest of their squads, Darman, Fi and Niner.
            Three months after the Battle of Geonosis, he accompanied Omega Squad on a mission to the world of Qiilura.[2] He helped in the capture of the Separatist scientist, Doctor Ovolot Qail Uthan, and also in the defeat of the Separatist forces there, who were under the command of Ghez Hokan. During the mission, he was injured by Hurati.
            A month later, Atin participated in the Galactic City spaceport hostage siege and helped to take out the Korunnai terrorists.[3]
            During the Mission to the Corellian-Perlemian Intersection, Atin and the rest of Omega Squad captured some terrorists connected to a terror cell on Coruscant.[4] They were assigned with Delta Squad and Kal Skirata to destroy the terrorist network and during the mission, Atin met up again with Walon Vau. Sev, a member of Delta Squad who had also trained under Vau, tried to protect Vau and had uneasy feelings towards Atin at first, but Kal Skirata made them cooperate. After the mission was over, Atin got his chance. He engaged Vau in nothing but a black bodysuit and with no weapons except a standard-issue commando vibroblade. They fought until Atin was in a position to kill Vau, but before Atin could deal the killing blow, Bardan Jusik burst in, separated them both with the Force, and ordered Atin to stand down.
            During the course of the Coruscant mission, Atin became romantically involved with a Twi'lek waitress named Laseema.
            About 65 days after the Coruscant mission, Atin accompanied the Null-class ARC trooper Prudii on a mission to the droid factory on Olanet.[5] Atin had volunteered to do this, while the rest of Omega Squad were resting on Coruscant for a few days, so that he could learn Prudii's technique of infiltrating droid factories and making them produce substandard droids that could be defeated more easily.
            The mission was successful, but while they were there, Atin began to question the official Republic Intelligence figures for the strength of the Separatist Droid Army. They claimed that there were quadrillions of droids, but on Olanet, Atin could only see evidence for just a few hundred million.
            They were extracted from Olanet by a TIV, which under Prudii's orders detoured and attacked a Separatist droid transport near to Cato Neimoidia. This was an action that Atin thought was a bit crazy, because the droids were probably of a spiked batch, but Prudii explained that if they stopped taking shots at Separatists at whatever chance they had, then the Separatists may realize that the Republic had sabotaged their droids. Afterward they headed to an RV point near Drall in the Corellian system, to meet up with Kal Skirata, who had recently returned from a mission on Kamino. Atin was glad to see him again.
            A week later, Atin was sent with Omega Squad to the world of Gaftikar, to aide the Null-class ARC trooper, A'den in training the local Gaftikari resistance forces.[6] They were transported there aboard the Core Conveyor, along with the 2nd Airborne Company of the 212th Attack Battalion. The clones of the Airborne Company showed a dislike to Omega Squad, because of their Mandalorian heritage. Atin asked them why they had a problem with this and found out that the Airborne Company had fought against the Mandalorian Protectors, resulting in many casualties. Atin found this whole incident disconcerting, as it was the first case he found of clone troopers disliking other clone troopers, despite the fact that he was already aware of the heated rivalry between the Nulls and the Alpha-class ARC troopers. Afterward, he tried to take his mind off the incident, by reading a letter that Laseema had sent him.
            Atin and the rest of Omega Squad were dropped onto Gaftikar from the air, wearing Clone paratrooper wings that they had fitted onto their armor and they were soon found by A'den, who showed them the location of the rebel's camp. The job of training the local Marit resistance fighters had originally fallen to Sull, but he had gone MIA. The Marits got on well with all the clones, including Atin. When they offered him some of their stew, A'den told him "not to ask" about it and he happily tucked in. However, he then learned that the Marits had a custom of eating their dead and that the stew contained the grandmother of one of the lizards, something that prompted Atin to throw up. Fi made a number of jokes about this.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Atin_Skirata</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAtinSkirata</string></dict>
        <key>Jao Assam</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.904.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jao Assam was a Human male who served Empress Marasiah Fel's Empire as an Imperial Knight. He was mentored by the senior Imperial Knight Yalta Val, who was also his close friend. Following the Second Imperial Civil War, he went to the Ithori system as an agent of the new Triumvirate. Jao was assigned to supervise the construction of the Ithori link of a galactic communications array system. After losing contact with Yalta Val, who had been assigned to the Carreras system, Jao ventured there to find his Master. There, he discovered that a rogue Sith named Darth Wredd had kidnapped and impersonated his Master. With the aid of the junk dealer Ania Solo, a descendant of the smuggler—turned—Hero of Yavin Han Solo, and her companions the assassin droid AG-37 and the Mon Calamari Sauk, Jao was able to rescue Master Val. However, Jao was seriously wounded in the process. They were also unable to apprehend Darth Wredd, who escaped to parts unknown after using the communications array to deliver a manifesto.
            While recovering from his wounds, Jao received a Force vision warning that Darth Wredd intended to kill Empress Fel, the leader of the Imperial Knights. With his superiors unwilling to listen, Jao and his newly-found friend Ania Solo embarked on a quest to hunt down Darth Wredd. Since he had left his post without permission, Jao was charged with desertion with the death penalty weighing over his head. After tracking Darth Wredd's henchman Dieben to Nalyd, Jao and Ania traveled to the watery world of Dac where they discovered that a pirate syndicate led by another rogue Sith, Darth Luft, had enslaved a large number of Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees. While they were unable to find Darth Wredd there, Jao along with Ania's companions succeeded in alerting the Triumvirate authorities to the presence of the pirates, who dispatched a task force to free the slaves. During the ensuing battle, Jao personally fought and killed Darth Luft.
            Despite liberating the Mon Calamari and Quarren slaves, Jao and his companions later learnt that they had merely played into the hands of Darth Wredd by helping him to eliminate another member of the One Sith. Darth Wredd had planned to destroy the One Sith order in order to create a new Sith order based on the Rule of Two. Following the events on Dac, Jao had to contend with a new problem in the form of his friend Ania being framed for the murder of the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton. After Ania was kidnapped by her former love interest Ramid, Jao, Sauk and AG-37 embarked on a rescue mission which took them to an inhospitable planet that rained glass and acid. There, Jao rescued her from a bounty hunter who wanted to frame her for the murder of Alton. Following a protracted duel, Ania succeeded in killing the bounty hunter.
            However, Ania was shortly later arrested by Imperial stormtroopers. Jao Assam, Sauk and AG-37 followed Ania back to the galactic capital Coruscant to clear her name. Jao succeeded in clearing Ania's name by presenting evidence that Alton's real killer wore a prosthetic hand. Since Ania had biological hands, it was proved that she did not murder Teemen Alton. The real killer was the mysterious bounty hunter they had encountered on their journeys. As a result, Ania was released by the Triumvirate authorities. Unfortunately for Jao, he was immediately imprisoned following the proceedings for the crime of deserting the Imperial Knights. While in prison, Jao was visited by his quarry Darth Wredd, who offered to help him escape if he would become his Sith apprentice.
            Seeing an opportunity to thwart Darth Wredd's plot to kill the Empress, Jao reluctantly followed Wredd and escaped offworld. They traveled to the dead floating world of Mala. There, Wredd tricked Jao into sending their coordinates to both the Triumvirate authorities and the One Sith. Darth Wredd intended to lure his adversaries to Mala where he intended to destroy the One Sith order and to kill Empress Fel. Darth Wredd's plan succeeded and two rival armies converged on Mala. During the fighting, Jao and Wredd temporarily joined forces to help Ania and the Imperials destroy the One Sith. At the climax, Wredd then attempted to assassinate Empress Fel. Before he could finish his work, Wredd was stopped and immobilized by Jao Assam. While Wredd demanded that Jao kill him, Jao refused because he realized that Wredd was intending to bring him over to the dark side of the Force. Ultimately, Wredd was killed by Jao's companion Ania, seemingly ending the threat of the Sith to the galaxy. Following the defeat of the Sith, Jao left the Imperial Knights and joined Ania and her companions.
            Jao Assam was a young Male Human Imperial Knight who lived during the time of the Second Imperial Civil War and Darth Wredd's insurgency. At some point in his early career, Assam had been mentored by Master Yalta Val, a senior Imperial Knight.[2] Following the conclusion of the Second Imperial Civil War which saw the defeat of the One Sith, a new Galactic Federation Triumvirate was created which consisted of the Fel Empire, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Alliance Remnant. The new Galactic Empress Marasiah Fel embarked on an ambitious communications infrastructure project to link the Outer Rim Territories with the rest of the galaxy. This involved the creation of a series of communications array stations across the galaxy.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jao_Assam</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJaoAssam</string></dict>
        <key>Eagle</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.905.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>The Eagle was a male Human terrorist leader who lead a terrorist force against the Sith Empire during the Cold War. He sought to change the Empire through force after being dissatisfied with the Treaty of Coruscant. Originally an Imperial starfighter pilot who fought at Coruscant and Druckenwell, after losing his squad-mates to Republic troopers and others being "erased" by Imperial Intelligence, he, with assistance from Darth Jadus, developed plans to return the Empire to its former isolationist ways using the Eradicators superweapon Satellites. He was killed during a confrontation with Cipher Nine after the latter tracked him to Nal Hutta.[2]
            Before taking the moniker "The Eagle," this male individual was a starfighter pilot who flew with the Imperial squadrons during several battle leading up to the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant. He was decorated for missions flown during the Battle of Druckenwell and the Sacking of Coruscant, but was extremely concerned for his career with the Empire after several of his squadmates were killed in action or disappeared as a result of Imperial Intelligence's meddling. He eventually dropped out of the service after the news broke about the signing of the Treaty, becoming furious with the Empire's ways.
            He eventually joined forces with Sith Lord Darth Jadus due to the two's wish to change the outlook of the Empire; Jadus to become it's ultimate master and remake it in his image, the Eagle to return it to its isolationist methods so as to conquer the Galactic Republic when the time came. Taking on his new moniker, he spent years during the Cold War developing and stringing together a network of terrorists, spies and leaders capable of wreaking havoc upon the Empire from within and outside it's borders.
            As a diversion, the Eagle sent a terrorist team to assault a network of piping and power conduits the fed the Empire's capital of Kaas City. Intended to fail, the team of saboteurs was defeated by Imperial Intelligence before the sabotage could be finished. Finally, with enough of a push from Jadus upon Imperial Intelligence, the Eagle launched their offensive and destroyed Jadus' battle cruiser, the Dominator, above Dromund Kaas. He later made contact with the planet and transmitted a planet-wide communication, stating their intention to change the Empire by any means necessary.
            With the Empire in chaos, the Eagle's network began construction of the Eradicator superweapons - lasers with the capability to wipe out populations with the correct access codes and targeting methods. However, a lone Imperial Intelligence operative slowed down the project's completion by shutting down several operations and contacts across the galaxy, including a VerveGen Corporation factory on Nar Shaddaa and a Ghost cell operation led by the Old Man on Tatooine. The Eagle's location was finally traced through several communications to the central Eradicator construction facility on Hutta. Cipher Nine confronted the Eagle and defeated him in combat, but before his death, he revealed that he was not the leader of the organization and the Empire had been betrayed by someone from within, right before Cipher Nine shot him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascEagle</string></dict>
        <key>Archiban Frodrick Kimble</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.906.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Archiban Frodrick Kimble, better known as "Doc", was a Human male doctor who worked as a combat medic throughout the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, and later joined the crew of the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython as the Galactic War broke out between the two galactic powers. Born on the planet Ralltiir in 3670 BBY, Kimble attended Coruscant University's prestigious medical program on the Republic capital of Coruscant before graduating with high honors as a licensed xenopathologist. However, Kimble gave up the life of a doctor in the Core Worlds to bring medical care to the people of the Outer Rim, taking on the name "Doc" and traveling the galaxy for the next five years.
            Doc's escapades often saw him leave a trail of jilted lovers and furious criminals in his wake as Doc took it upon himself to right wrongs when he saw them, though after an encounter with a trio of crime lords on the planet Little Kessel, Doc joined the Balmorran resistance as an unofficial member and worked as a doctor as the resistance fighters battled the Empire's occupation of the planet Balmorra. When the Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython came to Balmorra on a covert mission, Doc found himself helping the Knight and the Republic in securing a prototype cloaking device, and he decided to join the Jedi's crew when the Hero of Tython left Balmorra. Along with the Jedi's other allies, Doc aided the Hero's efforts to capture the Sith Emperor and then to prevent the Emperor from destroying the galaxy with a dark side ritual. After the Hero defeated the Emperor in a final battle, Doc and the other members of the Knight's crew were awarded the Cross of Glory, the Republic's highest honor.
            A Human male born on the planet Ralltiir[1] in 3670 BBY,[2] Archiban Frodrick Kimble grew up on Ralltiir during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, and he dreamed of being a heroic figure who would save the day and win against unimaginable odds. During the subsequent Cold War, Kimble gained the chance to attend[1] the University of Coruscant[7] on the Republic capital of Coruscant, and he enrolled in the university's medical school, the First Republic Medical Academy of Coruscant.[1] While studying to be a doctor, Kimble encountered a fellow student with notoriously poor medical skills and intelligence, though the man's family wealth prevented him from being kicked out.[8] Kimble began to specialize in xenopathology while also learning the skills of combat medicine, orthodontia, and other medical disciplines, and his classmates often complained that Kimble received favorable treatment from his female instructors.[2] Despite the accusations, however, Kimble graduated with highest honors[7] near the top of his class[1] in record time[2] by 3647 BBY,[4] and surprised his teachers and classmates by disappearing to the Outer Rim Territories and offering his medical services to a wide variety of clients in the galaxy's most dangerous regions.[1]
            Taking on the nickname "Doc," Kimble traveled the Outer Rim for the next five years, bringing medical care to impoverished and dangerous star systems.[1] During that time, Doc had encounters with a number of criminals and other unusual characters, including the disease-ridden crime lord Fashaka Four-Toes[4] and the Rattataki anarchist and Hutt Cartel enforcer Kaliyo Djannis. Doc's romantic relationship with Djannis ended quickly,[9] and another relationship with a woman named Lynlee on the planet Malastare ended when Doc left her behind without leaving her any credits to purchase passage on a shuttle off-planet.[10] Doc soon became known for selling medical items ranging from trauma kits to entire hospitals, and a gang of criminals nicknamed him "Doc Operator,"[11] though he earned their ire when he scammed them out of a large sum of credits and failed to deliver a promised shipment of spice.[12] When Doc learned of a powerful Hutt who was hoarding medpacs after a powerful groundquake, Doc forged a death mark signed by the Hutt against a clan of Mandalorian warriors and helped the clan discover the false death mark. The Mandalorians promptly attacked the Hutt's palace, and Doc managed to recover the medpacs and a few rare gems from the palace in the chaos. Doc donated the medpacs to all of the hospitals in the disaster zone, an action that saved thousands of lives.[11]
            During his travels, Doc spent a short amount of time practicing orthodontia on the planet Rodia,[13] as well as a brief period impersonating a member of the Imperial Medical Corps on the Imperial-occupied planet Sullust,[4] and had other adventures on planets such as Taris.[2] Doc also worked with the organization known as the Red Band Rebels on the planet Cadinth for a time.[4] In 3644 BBY, Doc encountered a Twi'lek doctor named Prudy on the planet Ord Mantell, and the two began a romantic relationship that soon resulted in their engagement. Doc even used the credits from his spice scam to purchase Prudy a hospital on the planet Alderaan, but Prudy's rushing of their wedding gave Doc cold feet and he left her at the altar.[12] Around the same time, a trio of jealous crime lords on Ord Mantell supposedly placed a bounty on Doc, which some believed was the reason for his departure. However, Doc's adventuring and his obsession with undermining tyrants and despots across the galaxy came to end on the planet Little Kessel, where he crossed the Kaleesh warlord Xim'tahal the Defaced and was nearly killed as a result. After that encounter, Doc joined up with the Balmorran resistance on the planet Balmorra,[2] where he aided the resistance fighters unofficially as a doctor in their fight against the Sith Empire.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Archiban_Frodrick_Kimble</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascArchibanFrodrickKimble</string></dict>

        <key>Arcann</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.908.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Arcann was a Force-sensitive male Human who was the son of Senya Tirall and Valkorion, the "Immortal Emperor" of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. He was the twin brother of Thexan, with whom he led a series of raids against the worlds of the larger galaxy. During the attack on Korriban Arcann was caught in an explosion that took his left arm and scarred the left side of his face, necessitating cybernetic replacements. Subsequently, Arcann became furious at the indifference of Valkorion and attempted to kill him, only for Thexan to intervene and be struck down by Arcann's lightsaber instead. When Valkorion offered to share his power with the Outlander, Arcann attempted to assassinate Valkorion again, which was successful, killing Valkorion's physical body while his spirit attached himself to the Outlander, whom Arcann trapped by freezing in carbonite. Arcann assumed his father's Eternal Throne and led the Eternal Empire in a massive invasion of the larger galaxy, which prevailed over both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic within a year, forcing them to pay tribute and making Zakuul the dominant power in the galaxy. Arcann ruled as Emperor for five years after his father's death, until the Outlander was rescued from carbonite and started a revolt against the Eternal Empire. During the Battle of Odessen, Arcann was defeated by the Outlander and taken by his mother to recuperate, while Arcann's sister Vaylin along with SCORPIO took over the Eternal Throne in his absence.
            Arcann and his twin brother were sons of the "Immortal Emperor" of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul, and Senya Tirall, a member of Valkorion's elite guard from the ranks of the Knights of Zakuul. As children, Arcann and Thexan would often swap clothes to confuse their servants. Senya loved the twins but they didn't return her affections, even after their sister Vaylin was born. The children played together, sparring in the shadow of the Eternal Fleet or running away and living in the Endless Swamp for a month. The twins were trained from childhood to be warriors, but Arcann gradually became resentful of their father's apparent lack of interest or affection towards them, his resentment growing as the years passed, despite Thexan's attempts to placate him. Eventually, when Vaylin began displaying dangerously unstable power, Valkorion locked her away on Nathema to contain her powers. When Senya attempted to leave Valkorion and take her children, Arcann and his siblings simply laughed, calling her weak.[4]
            When the twins reached adulthood, Arcann retrieved Vaylin from her prison in the Sanitarium on Nathema. Upon arriving on the planet, Arcann discovered it was devoid of the Force and felt his corrupting presence on his mind. Later, when Valkorion presented Vaylin with her first lightsaber, Arcann and Thexan moved to defend their father when she ignited her blade, only to hold back at his command. To their relief, Vaylin deactivated her lightsaber and knelt down before Valkorion.[5]
            By 3637 BBY, Arcann and Thexan requested their father's permission to lead an attack to test the strength of the galactic powers of the greater galaxy. Valkorion approved their venture, but decreed that only Thexan would lead the Eternal Fleet, ordering Arcann to remain on Zakuul. Arcann disobeyed his father's wishes and joined his brother anyway. They fought on many worlds, driving back the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, before finally striking at Korriban.
            They clashed with the Sith under the command of Darth Atroxa in the Valley of the Dark Lords. During the battle, Arcann was grievously wounded in an explosion that took his arm and left the left side of his face scarred. The prince was taken away from the battle to an encampment, where he was operated upon. By the end of the ordeal, Arcann had been fitted with a replacement cybernetic arm, the left side of his face hidden behind a durasteel mask made to conceal the prince's burnt face. The following day, Arcann was on his feet again and led a renewed assault, killing Darth Atroxa after he used his new cybernetic arm to twist her wrist.
            Returning to Zakuul, Arcann and Thexan presented the lightsabers of the fallen Jedi and Sith as trophies from the battle to their father. However, Valkorion turned away in silence, and overcome by the dark side of the Force, Arcann became furious and attempted to attack the Emperor. Thexan, in an attempt to prevent his father's death, pulled his brother back. Arcann turned his attention to Thexan and struck out at him, but their brief duel ended when Arcann struck his brother down with a cut across the stomach, and the glint of the dark side faded from his eyes while he cradled Thexan. After his brother's passing, Valkorion instructed Arcann, now his only son, to come with him.
            Arcann later attempted to inform his father of a joint Imperial-Republic fleet approaching their territory, but Valkorion was already aware, and sent the Eternal Fleet to intercept them. In the aftermath of the battle, Arcann recovered two survivors, Darth Marr and the Outlander, whom he brought directly to his father on his Eternal Flagship. Before they entered the Eternal Throne room, Arcann was approached by the Scion Heskal, whom he mocked for still putting faith in the catastrophe the Scions foretold before dismissing him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Arcann</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascArcann</string></dict>

In around 34 ABY, he rode in a race on the crime lord Sturg Ganna's fathier Kessel Runner and in another on the fathier Hoth Stuff.
            The human male Arca Yroca worked as a jockey on the planet Cantonica during the war between the First Order and the Resistance. In around 34 ABY,[4] he participated in several fathier races at the Canto Bight racetrack in the same night.[2][3]
            In the fifth race of the night, Yroca rode at first post on a fathier named Kessel Runner that belonged to the crime lord Big Sturg Ganna.[3] In another race, the jockey rode the fathier Hoth Stuff and whipped it with an electrocrop. Shortly after the race, all of the fathier's kept in the racetrack's stables were released by the Resistance agents Finn and Rose Tico.[2]
            Yroca had fair skin.[2]
            The jockey wore a orange lycresh racing outfit designed to be comfortable but also sleek and lightweight to reduce air drag. He also wore a orange helmet with his sponsor's logo emblazoned upon it. The jockey used an electrocrop to whip his fathiers during races.[1]

Jagged owned the Corellian Inter-System Marketing Station and fuel depot on the Gus Treta Inner-System Market Station with his wife, Zena.
            He and his wife were killed when the Bonestar Pirates, trying to escape from Corellian authorities, lifted off while refueling lines were still attached to their ship. The resulting explosion threatened to destroy Gus Treta, but Jagged and Zena sacrificed themselves to limit the destruction to their depot.

            His grandson Jagged Fel was named after him.
            During production of the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the final installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, Sang Jun Lee produced a piece of concept art which featured Wedge Antilles' father.

        <key>Wedge Antilles</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.912.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wedge Antilles, a Human male, was a famed Corellian pilot and general, known as a hero of the Rebel Alliance and New Republic. Orphaned at age seventeen, he joined the Rebellion after Imperial forces killed his girlfriend, Mala Tinero. A standout starfighter pilot, he was one of the few to survive the Battle of Yavin, after which he founded Rogue Squadron with his friend Luke Skywalker. Antilles and Skywalker built Rogue Squadron into a renowned unit, and after the Battle of Hoth, Antilles took command. He flew as Red Leader in the Battle of Endor, striking the blow that destroyed the second Death Star alongside Lando Calrissian and becoming the only pilot to survive both Death Star runs.
            As the Rebel Alliance became the New Republic, Antilles continued to serve, gaining a reputation as a consummate soldier and the New Republic's greatest pilot. He led Rogue Squadron in a covert mission to bring down Coruscant's shields, allowing the New Republic to capture the galactic capital planet. When denied permission to remove Imperial leader Ysanne Isard from power over Thyferra, he resigned with his squadron and led a private guerrilla war that successfully toppled Isard. Accepted back into the New Republic, he formed Wraith Squadron as a commando unit and led it in operations against the Imperial Warlord Zsinj.
            In 9 ABY, Antilles accepted the promotion to general that his friend, Supreme Commander Gial Ackbar, had long desired for him. As a general, he reluctantly moved out of the cockpit and into a role in fleet operations, frequently commanding the Star Dreadnought Lusankya. During a mission to the planet Adumar in 13 ABY, he ignited a romance with Iella Wessiri, a friend in whom he had been interested for several years, and married her after the mission's conclusion. They had two daughters, Syal and Myri, as Antilles became Chief of Staff of New Republic Starfighter Command and then finally returned to command Rogue Squadron in 18 ABY. In 19 ABY, after peace was achieved with the Imperial Remnant, Antilles retired with more than twenty years of service to the Alliance and New Republic, ten as a general.
            When the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy in 25 ABY, Antilles emerged from retirement, becoming the commander of New Republic Fleet Group Three. He participated in the failed defense of Coruscant, then retreated to Borleias. There he made a stand against heavy opposition for several months longer than expected and defeated the famed ex-Warmaster Czulkang Lah, inspiring hope across the New Republic that the war against the invaders could be won. In 29 ABY, Antilles was one of the commanders in the Recapture of Coruscant that ended the war.
            He returned to retirement, but after being imprisoned by the Galactic Alliance, the New Republic's successor state, in the run-up to the Second Galactic Civil War, Antilles escaped. He joined the forces of his homeworld, Corellia, as it revolted against the galactic government, reluctantly taking a side against his best friend, General Tycho Celchu, and his own daughter Syal, who had become a Galactic Alliance pilot. He served as the Supreme Commander of the Corellian Defense Force, but he came to believe that the Corellian regime was itself corrupt and immoral. He resigned and instead offered his services to the New Jedi Order, led by his lifelong friend Luke Skywalker. Skywalker formed a Jedi Coalition and, with Antilles's help, destroyed the Centerpoint superweapon controlled by the Corellian Confederation, then went on to defeat the Galactic Alliance's Sith leader, Darth Caedus, and end the war. Afterward, Antilles retired for the third time, hoping to finally be able to live quietly with his family.
            A Human male Corellian, Wedge Antilles was born in 21 BBY, the son of Jagged Antilles and his wife Zena, who owned a fueling depot in the Gus Treta Inner-System Market Station over the planet Corellia.[2][15] He had a sister, Syal, who was ten years older. She left Corellia while Antilles was only seven and lived estranged from her family. The Antilleses never had any word of her and spoke very little about her, but Wedge Antilles remained fond of the sister he never really knew.[16][17] He lived untouched by the Galactic Empire and the dissent rising against it.[18] Simpler concerns occupied his mind, such as his dream of living in Coronet City, the glittering capital of Corellia.[19] He had maps of the city projected onto the walls of his bedroom, and he longed to contribute to those maps himself by becoming an architect and building great structures.[19][20] At the same time, he was fascinated by space, and daydreamed of naval adventures.[21]
            Antilles split his time between a farm school located in Corellia's northern hemisphere and his parents' fueling depot on the Gus Treta station. At farm school, he received training in rural tasks along with his education. He learned to ride thaks and slopewings, and from them herded nerfs and naugas. The other half of the year, Antilles traded pastoral pursuits for immersion in the world of spacegoing technology. Even as a child, he flew tugs and shuttles in busy Corellian space.[18] He worked as a mechanic as well and developed a great proficiency in repair as well as piloting.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wedge_Antilles/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWedgeAntilles</string></dict>

        <key>Cassian Jeron Andor</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.914.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cassian Jeron Andor, also known by the aliases Willix, Aach, Joreth Sward, and the title Fulcrum, was a human male soldier, pilot and Intelligence officer who served in the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars and then the Alliance to Restore the Republic during Operation Fracture and the Galactic Civil War. Andor joined a Rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a superweapon built by the Galactic Empire. Although the mission was a success, Andor perished along with the rest of Rogue One.
            Cassian Jeron Andor was a human male who was born on the planet Fest in 26 BBY to a human father and unknown mother. During the Clone Wars, Andor joined an insurrectionist cell backed by the Confederacy of Independent Systems that operated in the wilds of the Outer Rim Territories and fought against the Galactic Republic. Andor saw his first combat experience in this cell as a child soldier in 20 BBY by tossing rocks and bottles at Republic walkers and clone troopers. Sometime during the Clone Wars, when Andor was still young,[4] Andor's father was killed at the Carida Academy during a protest against the expansion of Republic militarism.[1]
            Prior to 0 BBY, Andor joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic after being recruited by General Davits Draven.[1] Holding the rank of captain, Andor served as an officer in the Alliance's Intelligence branch.[3]
            A veteran spy of the Rebellion, Andor maintained a network of contacts throughout the galaxy who kept him informed about the activities of the Galactic Empire.[2] Throughout his career as an intelligence agent, Andor worked undercover and used several aliases. While working as a government agent on Ord Mantell, Andor went by the name Willix. As a senatorial contact on Darknell, he was Aach. Andor used the name Joreth Sward when he was an assistant to Admiral Grendreef. Andor also used the code name Fulcrum when he worked as a Rebel recruiter in the Albarrio sector.[1]
            Andor, along with the twins Kertas and Rismor, went to Wecacoe to undertake a mission to extract Imperial security protocols. While inside storage facility 47, they were confronted by the KX-series security droid K-2SO. Kertas and Rismor managed to wipe most of K-2SO's memory, and Andor ordered him to escort them back to their ship. After a brief confrontation with several stormtroopers, Andor and K-2SO located a new ship and escaped Wecacoe.[5]
            Following this, Andor and K-2SO were sent to the F'tzner system to undertake a raid on a Imperial freighter. Andor used gas to trick the Empire into thinking that smugglers stole the cargo as smugglers were known to use gas to raid transports. When they got to the cargo room, they found three Wookiees named D'Koetaa, D'Lylaa, and Wyhyatt, and took them instead of the cargo. Andor then took them to the monastery moon of Charissia in the Bartahn sector. There, he left K-2SO to look after the three Wookiees while he undertook a raid.[6]
            Andor was dispatched on a mission to the Ring of Kafrene where he met Tivik, a Rebel informant from Saw Gerrera's partisans. Through Tivik, Andor learned that the Empire had built a superweapon which his informant described as a planet killer. During the meeting, Andor killed two stormtroopers who had become suspicious of the exchange. He also unwillingly had to execute Tivik, who was unable to escape the area because of an injured arm, before more stormtroopers could arrive and capture him.[2]
            Andor was then stationed at the Rebel base on Yavin 4 when Jyn Erso was assigned by Mon Mothma, a leader of the Rebel Alliance, to take part in what became the theft of the Death Star plans. During the mission, Andor was assigned to keep an eye on Erso due to her reckless and potentially volatile nature and was given a secret mission to kill Galen Erso in an attempt to stop the development of the Death Star.[2]
            Once he, Jyn, and K-2SO landed on Jedha, he and Jyn left to find Gerrera and his rebels. Going to his various sources, the two got stuck in the middle of a battle between the Imperials and Saw's rebels, the Partisans, during which he took out a man from the group in an attempt to save Jyn. As the fight continued, the two escaped and ran into K-2SO. The two were then mistaken for his prisoners and were detained but were saved by Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus, only to be captured by Saw's forces for killing one of their own. While imprisoned, he found the Imperial pilot, Bodhi, and asked him of the location of Jyn's father. Shortly afterwards, the destruction of Jedha City caused the Partisans to flee, letting him escape with Chirrut, Baze, Bodhi, and Jyn.[2]
            The group arrived on Eadu, where they crashed attempting to avoid Imperial detection. Cassian and Bodhi left so that he could get in position to take out Galen and then had Bodhi leave to find a ship to escape with. He then watched a meeting between Galen and Director Orson Krennic. After missing several opportunities to take him out, Cassian realized there was more to the situation than what met the eye. He decided there must be another way. However a strike force from the Rebellion came and attacked the facility, killing Galen in the process. He then went and rescued Jyn and the group leaves on a stolen Zeta-class cargo shuttle to Yavin 4.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cassian_Jeron_Andor</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCassianJeronAndor</string></dict>

In return, Anevi hoped to persuade Vos to make financial contributions to charitable causes that the governor cared deeply about. On the yacht, the pair met in Vos's private office; however, the meeting ended with the criminal stabbing Anevi with a Kyuzo petar, killing him.
            The governor had fair skin, gray eyes and graying hair.[3]
            At the time of his death, Anevi wore a gray gaberwool mantle of office over a black shirt and pants along with a belt buckle that contained his transactional credit chip portfolio.[2]

            During the filming of Solo, there was a debate to how exactly Dryden Vos would dispose of Anevi. According to screenwriter Jon Kasdan, most of the film's crew wanted to have Vos decapitate Anevi, and a version where Anevi's head rolls across the floor was actually filmed, but it was ultimately scrapped as some of them felt that it was a little too rough for a Star Wars film.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Diles_Anevi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDilesAnevi</string></dict>
        <key>Andronikos Revel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.916.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Andronikos Revel was a male Human captain in the Galactic Republic before he deserted and became a pirate during the Cold War.
            Andronikos joined the Republic Navy and made a rank of captain before eventually deserting. He was an accountant on Muunilinst when he decided he wanted more adventure and robbed a few million credits from the head of InterGalactic Banking Clan. His friend Carl Norn made Andronikos Revel first mate on his ship Bloodshot Rancor, though Norn eventually lost the ship due to gambling problems.
            For five notorious years, the pirate Andronikos Revel terrorized the Republic and Imperial space alike as the captain of the Sky Princess. Known for his sharp temper and sharper flying skills, he was one of the few pirate captains to serve as his own pilot. At some point they received a tip from a Republic Strategic Information Service agent Harman Rike about free-trader in neutral space, but were blasted by the Imperial fleet that showed up and Andronikos became convinced Rike set them up on some purpose.
            His piracy career was cut short by a strange mutiny after his crew raided a ship carrying valuable artifacts. His first mate Sylas Wilkes robbed all of Andronikos' possessions and ejected him in an escape pod. Andronikos spend ten days inside the pod before being picked up by the Imperials who had been hunting the artifact. After a year in Imperial prison, Andronikos Revel was let loose, with Darth Zash hoping he'd lead her back to the artifact. He had been meticulously hunting and killing the mutineers who betrayed him ever since.
            When hunting the artifacts of Tulak Hord for Darth Zash, Kallig had gone to Tatooine, where they were told to ask Andronikos for information regarding its location. Andronikos revealed that Wilkes was in possession of the artifact, and agreed to help Kallig if he could get his revenge. He had an inside woman, Casey Rix, keeping tabs on Wilkes and was asked by Kallig to lure him into a trap. Andronikos and Kallig then went to Wilkes' hideout and defeated him, but he revealed that the men he assigned to guard Andronikos' special blasters and the artifact had stolen it three days earlier. After Andronikos silenced Wilkes once and for all, the two set out to find the thieves but only found data pad recordings, corpses, and the artifact. This angered Andronikos, as he was unable to take revenge, but decided to let go of it and asked to accompany Kallig in the Inquisitor's travels.
            While on his journey with Kallig, Andronikos often talked about his history, and was curious about some aspects of Kallig's history. Kallig even allowed Andronikos to pilot the ship. However, Andronikos often departed the ship to deal with old problems, hide from Republic, or take his revenge. He tracked down Harman Rike, but the man was killed before he could give Revel any answers. Andronikos eventually admitted to Kallig that he wanted to continue at Sith Lord's side indefinitely, even offering to teach Kallig's hypothetical apprentices and/or children skills that weren't included in Sith training.
            When Lord Kallig defeated Darth Thanaton and ascended to the Dark Council as Darth Nox, Andronikos knelt to the new Dark Lord along with his other companions and his legion of new underlings. Andronikos and the other companions later met with Darth Nox to discuss their future.
            Some time after the Rakatan Relics Crisis, Andronikos was listening as the Sith Lord's apprentice, Ashara Zavros, told her master about a vision and how a woman told her that the Sith Lord needed to go to Rishi. Andronikos commented that Rishi was dangerous and full of other pirates, like himself – its coordinates had also turned up in the ship's navicomputer without any prompting. The Sith Lord set course for Rishi, following Ashara's vision.
            Soon after the destruction of Ziost, the Sith Lord was called to Wild Space by Darth Marr. While Darth Nox met with Marr, Andronikos promised to watch the ship and requisition new supplies. Very soon after, they were attacked by the Eternal Fleet. The Fury was then trapped at the boarding ramp, so Andronikos called the Sith Lord to help. Lord Kallig managed to get the Fury free and Andronikos piloted the ship to either stay and help Marr's fleet, or return to warn the Empire. Either way, Marr's ship was destroyed, and Darth Nox disappeared.
            During the Eternal Empire's conquest of the galaxy, Andronikos returned to Dromund Kaas with the rest of the crew, only to have the Fury grounded, the crew separated, and trapping Andronikos on Dromund Kaas.
            Even though he had a brutal childhood, he was able to become an accountant, but he wanted excitement in life and robbed the bank he was working for. It didn't take him long to fall into a life of piracy.
            Despite being a charming criminal who enjoyed challenges, he was not known for being the kind of guy to forgive somebody, especially not those who double-crossed him. However, he would get very irritated when he was unable to take revenge, especially when someone else killed his targets.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Andronikos_Revel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAndronikosRevel</string></dict>

            Andru, a Force-sensitive Human, was trained in the ways of the dark side of the Force by the Sith Empire, eventually attaining the title Darth Andru. A practitioner of the Jar'Kai technique, Andru wielded two purple-bladed lightsabers in combat. During his life on Dromund Kaas, Andru sought after ancient writings describing a powerful dark side ritual which would give the user mastery over the Force-walking skill.[1]
            Long after his death, Darth Andru's spirit was locked within his tomb where it seethed with an undying hatred. During the height of the Cold War, Andru's wraith was confronted and subjugated by the Sith Inquisitor known as Kallig who was able to master the Force-walking technique and consume Andru's spirit. Absorbing Andru's energy and adding that to Ergast's, Kallig confronted Dark Councilor Darth Thanaton and was soundly defeated, even with the added strength. However, the bond with the two ghosts kept Kallig from dying. The Sith Lord then decided to find more ghosts and use their power to defeat Thanaton. After adding Kalatosh Zavros and Horak-mul to the collection, Kallig returned to Dromund Kaas to face Thanaton. However, upon drawing on the power of all four ghosts, it became too much for Kallig to handle, causing the power to eat away Kallig's body while the ghosts threatened to drive them insane.[1]
            Kallig managed to overcome this and forcefully rebound the ghosts before defeating Thanaton and ascending to the Dark Council.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Andru</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthAndru</string></dict>

        <key>Ames Uravan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.921.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ames Uravan was a human male scientist from the planet Christophsis. He served the Galactic Empire from circa 19 BBY until his death in 0 BBY. During that time, Uravan was assigned to the Kyber crystal research team division of the Tarkin Initiative, stationed at the Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory. Under the leadership of Galen Erso, Uravan and his colleagues worked to turn kyber crystals into a viable and consistent energy source for use in the Death Star's superlaser, giving it the capability to destroy entire planets.
            When the Imperial Director Orson Krennic found evidence of a rebel sympathizer within the research team, he confronted Uravan and his colleagues. Even though Erso admitted to being the traitor, Krennic ordered his death troopers to kill the team of scientists anyways.
            Ames Uravan was a human male scientist from the planet Christophsis. He was in the service of the Galactic Empire[1] circa 19 BBY,[2] stationed at the planet Eadu's Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory, as part of the Kyber crystal research team division of the Tarkin Initiative. Members of the research team, including Uravan, were not there by choice and were kept secluded at their laboratories.[1]
            Under the leadership of Galen Erso, the scientists worked to make kyber crystals a viable and consistent energy source for use in the superlaser of the Death Star,[1] a Geonosian designed battle station[4] that would, with the superlaser, have the capability to destroy entire planets.[5]
            Eadu's mountainous terrain[1] hid the team's laboratories,[6] which were used for kyber crystal testing and development. Uravan's duties on the research team included overseeing the shipments of kyber crystal fragments from the moon Jedha. He would then implement his own phase-shifting grafting technique to fuse pieces of them together synthetically, so they would act as one.[1]
            When Director Orson Krennic found evidence of a rebel sympathizer within the research team[3] in 0 BBY,[2] he traveled to Eadu with a group of death troopers to investigate.[3] Upon his arrival, scientist Feyn Vann alerted his colleagues, including Uravan, that Krennic's shuttle would be landing soon, and Erso reassured the team that nothing was wrong.[7]
            Stormtroopers lead the scientists out of the laboratories and onto the platform outside. Krennic assembled his death trooper unit around the scientists, recalling them each by name, including Uravan. He announced his knowledge of the conspiracy against the Empire, by working with a pilot to spread word of the Death Star. He instructed the traitor to expose himself, but no response came from Uravan or his colleagues.[8]
            After waiting several moments, Krennic concluded that the scientists conspired in a group effort and readied his troopers for a firing squad execution. Erso intervened and confessed to being the traitor, pleading for Krennic to spare the others. However, as soon as Erso stepped out of the way, the director ordered the other scientists executed nonetheless. Uravan was shot and killed by a death trooper, and his body lay in the rain alongside the other members of the research team.[8]
            The team's work contributed to the completion of the Death Star project,[8] but the space station was destroyed soon after[5] due to the weakness Erso planted inside.[8]
            Ames Uravan had light skin, brown eyes, and brown hair.[1]
            While part of the Kyber crystal research team, Uravan wore a blue-and-white engineering jumpsuit.[8] The jumpsuit had antiseptic coveralls, which were marked with the insignias of both the Empire and the Tarkin Initiative.[1]
            His uniform had a tunic that would change colors when in the presence of dangerous radiation, and shoes grounded against potential static charges within the labs. His jumpsuit included a pocket over the chest that held code cylinders, which unlocked access to restricted laboratories.[1]
            Ames Uravan first appeared in the 2016 anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, in which he was portrayed by Robert Benedetti-Hall. The film's credits refer to him as "Engineer",[3] but his name was revealed in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo which was published the same day as the film.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ames_Uravan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAmesUravan</string></dict>
        <key>Alpha-17</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.922.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alpha-17, otherwise known as A-17 or simply Alpha, was an Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commando in the Republic's clone army during the Clone Wars.
            Alpha, as was the case with the rest of the ARCs, first saw action with the Separatist invasion of Kamino. As the Confederacy's droid forces pushed towards the heart of Tipoca City, the Kaminoan Prime Minister, Lama Su, activated the ARCs and authorized their deployment to hot-spots across Kamino in a last-ditch effort to save the planet's precious cloning facilities.
            During the fighting to push the droids from Tipoca's central armory, Alpha teamed up with Jedi Master Shaak Ti, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Kenobi's Padawan, Anakin Skywalker. When the city's clone stocks became compromised, Alpha rigged the lab to self-destruct, much to the dismay of the Jedi. After remarking, "They grow up loyal to the Republic, or they don't grow up at all," it was clear to the Jedi that they were not dealing with an average clone trooper. Ti wished there was another way, so Alpha made a strategy for Obi-Wan and Anakin to collapse the transparisteel walls linking the facility while Ti held back the ocean before they sealed the place off. When the plan worked and the attack was successfully repelled, Alpha then aborted the detonation sequence.
            When Naboo lost contact with the Gungan colony moon of Ohma-D'un, a Separatist attack was suspected, and General Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to investigate. Kenobi, having witnessed his lethal effectiveness on Kamino, took Alpha along for the ride. When the trio arrived on the surface, they found the Gungan colony in ruins and bodies for as far as the eye could see. Before they could complete their investigation into the cause of the genocidal slaughter, however, they fell under attack from the bounty hunter Durge and the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress. Under Kenobi's orders, Alpha went with Anakin to find and destroy the bio-weapon responsible for Ohma-D'un's destruction before it could be let loose in Theed. It was then that Anakin, uncomfortable with calling him simply "clone," named the ARC trooper "Alpha".
            Following the mission to Ohma-D'un, Alpha was once again chosen by Kenobi and Anakin to accompany them on another important mission. This time, the three were to lead the assault on the obscure Outer Rim world of Jabiim, which had recently declared its allegiance to Count Dooku's Confederacy. The initial days of the assault saw victory after victory for the Republic, but, as the rain continued to pour, their assault vehicles became bogged down in the mud and became an easy target for the Jabiimi guerrillas. As Republic casualties mounted, the rebels, their forces now bolstered with the addition of Separatist battle droids, stepped up their attacks. The Republic was dealt its greatest blow with the apparent death of Obi-Wan and Alpha while they were clearing out a downed All Terrain Tactical Enforcer.
            Neither Obi-Wan nor Alpha, however, died in the explosion that supposedly took their lives. In truth, they fell into Separatist custody and were transferred to a secret prison on Rattatak. Once there, Asajj Ventress, the dark Jedi from Ohma-D'un, tried to beat and torture the two of them into revealing sensitive information regarding Republic troop movements. Before she got the information she wanted, however, the two of them escaped under the guise of a prison break. Having fought their way off Rattatak and away from Ventress with the help of Anakin and Master Ki-Adi-Mundi, the two found their way back to the Republic and to the Grand Army.
            Following the ordeal, and after several weeks in a bacta tank, Alpha was transferred out of General Kenobi's Third Systems Army and was sent back to Kamino, where he was to train current and future generations of clone commanders. He followed Anakin's previous suggestion that he give them names, was promoted to the rank of captain, and became lead instructor of the Tipoca City training facility. Commanders Cody of the 212th Attack Battalion, Neyo of the 91st Reconnaissance, Bacara of the 21st Nova Corps, Gree of the 41st Elite Corps, Appo of the 501st Legion, Rex of the 501st Legion, Bly of the 327th Star Corps, Faie, and many more were among the first hundred to be enrolled in and graduate from his experimental training regimen, known as the ARC training program. Of those first hundred, a few were hand-picked by Alpha and assigned to Squad Seven, with Commanders Davijaan and Cody as its leaders.
            Alpha's duties on Kamino, however, did not mean an end to service in the field. Alpha was chosen to accompany Senator Bail Organa on his tour of the Outer Rim Sieges aboard the Star Destroyer Intervention. When the Intervention was commandeered by General Kenobi in order to lead the assault on Boz Pity, Alpha readied himself for yet another battle. During the fighting, Alpha was critically wounded by General Grievous himself, so much so that it was thought he'd never walk again. As hostilities wound down, Alpha, along with the supposed corpse of Asajj Ventress, was loaded onto a medical transport and sent back to Coruscant for treatment. En route, however, Ventress proved very much alive when she took control of the transport and ordered its pilots to take her into the unknown.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alpha-17</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAlpha17</string></dict>

        <key>Alexsandr Kallus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.925.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alexsandr Kallus was a human male revolutionary who served as an agent of the Imperial Security Bureau, operating number ISB-021, before becoming a rebel spy in the formative days of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
            As an Imperial operative, Kallus was a firm believer in bringing order to the galaxy. He worked to suppress dissent on numerous worlds, fighting against the insurgency of Saw Gerrera on Onderon, participating in the genocide on Lasan, and leading the hunt for the rebels of the Ghost on Lothal. His efforts on Lothal were largely unsuccessful, leading to an escalation of force against the growing rebellion in the form of both Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, Governor of the Outer Rim Territories, and the Sith Lord Darth Vader.
            After pursuing the Ghost crew for over one year, Kallus attempted to trap them in orbit of Geonosis. In the ensuing conflict, Kallus and one of the Ghost crew members, the Lasat warrior Garazeb Orrelios, were trapped on the frozen moon Bahryn. They found kinship as soldiers as they worked together to survive, and Kallus learned more about the rebels and their camaraderie. It was enough to make him question his beliefs about the Empire and the rebellion, and he covertly became a rebel spy under the codename of Fulcrum, thanks to Zeb. He fed the rebellion information about the Empire's activities, including those of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who was tasked with eliminating the rebels of the Lothal sector.
            Thrawn discovered Kallus' true allegiance after realizing there was a rebel spy in his midst, and Kallus was captured as he attempted to feed the rebels information for their planned attack on Lothal. Ultimately, Thrawn discovered the rebel base on Atollon and launched an attack that devastated the rebellion. Kallus broke free of Imperial custody during the battle and was taken in by the Ghost, and accompanied the surviving rebels to the base on Yavin 4, thus escaping from certain execution.
            Becoming a full-fledged member of the Rebellion, Kallus assisted the Alliance both tactically and in the battlefield. As a key ally of the Ghost crew, he aided them in their successful liberation of Lothal. After the Empire's demise in 4 ABY, Orrelious brought Kallus to Lira San, the ancient home of the Lasat people, to show the former ISB Agent that he had not destroyed the Lasat species after all. As a friend to Orrelios who turned against his former Empire, the Lasat welcomed Kallus as one of their own.
            Alexsandr Kallus,[10] a human male, was born on Coruscant[1] several years prior to the Invasion of Naboo, during the final years of the Galactic Republic.[2] After Darth Sidious, publicly known as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire, Kallus attended the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant, the main campus of the new regime's military training program.[5] At the Academy, Kallus notably studied under Wullf Yularen, who considered him one of his star pupils.[11] He also befriended Jovan, who soon became an informal mentor to the young Coruscanti. Eventually, the two completed their course of study together,[5] with Kallus graduating head of his class.[12] Later on, Kallus joined the Imperial Security Bureau,[1] a secret task force that pursued and destroyed rebellious activity throughout the galaxy.[13] Kallus was codenamed ISB-021 and became a high-ranked ISB Agent,[1] working in both the Internal Affairs branch and the Investigations branch of the bureau.[12]
            During his first time as an ISB agent, Kallus led his own platoon of stormtroopers. One day, Kallus and his platoon were sent by the Empire to bring order to the planet Onderon, a planet left in chaos after the Clone Wars, due to their former occupation by the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the false King, Sanjay Rash. During a routine patrol a rebel mercenary, a Lasat, working for Saw Gerrera, ambushed the platoon and knocked out Kallus. When the ISB agent came to, he found he couldn't move and was forced to watch as his squad was brutally murdered by the Lasat mercenary. Kallus would remember this moment during his next mission, the Fall of Lasan.[6]
            Kallus took part in the cleansing of the planet Lasan, in which the planet's species, the Lasat, was all but destroyed and completely driven away from their homeworld. Kallus gave the order for Imperial troops to use T-7 ion disruptor rifles against the population. These rifles were powerful enough to disable starships and had gruesome results when used against sentient beings. These weapons were ultimately banned by the Imperial Senate as a result of their destructive power.[14] Before the cleansing of Lasan ended, Kallus was given a J-19 bo-rifle by a member of the Lasan High Honor Guard that he had defeated.[6]
            Kallus worked with IG-88 in tracking down Imperial Army deserter turned smuggler Captain Han Solo of the Millennium Falcon. Kallus took a shuttle and found Solo during one of his smuggling operations. Kallus, after learning about Solo aiding Enfys Nest on Savareen, declared Solo an enemy of the Empire. He believed that Solo was smuggling items to Nest and ordered IG-88 to check Solo's cargo. However, Kallus and IG-88 were attacked by Solo's co-pilot, Chewbacca. Despite Solo and Chewbacca escaping, Kallus and IG-88 returned to the shuttle. Kallus ordered two Star Destroyers to not allow the Falcon to pass them. However, the Falcon was able to go between the two Star Destroyers and escape. Kallus could not believe how reckless Solo was.[15]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alexsandr_Kallus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAlexsandrKallus</string></dict>

        <key>Darth Acharon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.930.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Acharon was a male Human Sith Lord of the reconstituted Sith Empire who served as one of the twelve Dark Lords of the Sith on the Empire's ruling Dark Council during the Cold War with the Galactic Republic. Trained as a Sith Warrior, Acharon controlled the Sphere of Biotic Science within the Empire and was universally despised by the Imperial Military for his zero-tolerance policy on incompetence. During the Galactic War with the Republic, Acharon was sent to the Core World of Corellia to oversee the Battle of Corellia, and he was killed by a Republic strike team while defending the Ion Wall weapon in the Government District.
            A Human male trained as a Sith Warrior, the Sith Lord Darth Acharon had ascended to the resurgent Sith Empire's ruling Dark Council by the end of the Cold War with the Galactic Republic.[1] As a Dark Councilor, Acharon headed the Sphere of Biotic Science, one of the twelve Spheres of Influence within the Empire, and in that position he oversaw the branches of the Empire that dealt in medical science, cybernetic augmentation and physical enhancement—often in conjunction with Sith alchemy and magic.[2] During his career as a Dark Councilor, Acharon quickly became known for his views on incompetence among the Imperial Military. The Sith's zero-tolerance policy regarding failure led him to personally execute over two hundred soldiers throughout his tenure, regardless of whether the soldiers had failed critical missions or simply worn their uniforms incorrectly. Those officers and troopers who volunteered to serve under him received even more detrimental treatment at Acharon's hands, as the Dark Councilor despised sycophants as well.[3]
            Around 3641 BBY, Acharon and fellow Dark Councilor Darth Hadra traveled to the contested planet of Corellia to reinforce Darth Decimus,[1] head of the Sphere of Military Strategy,[2] in the war effort there.[1] During the Battle of Corellia, Darth Acharon attended an eventful meeting of the Dark Council on Korriban via hologram. The meeting was originally called by Darth Baras, who attempted to declare himself the Voice of the Emperor to the rest of the Council, a position that would have granted Baras control over the entire Empire—but the Dark Councilor was killed by his former apprentice, the newly appointed Emperor's Wrath. Along with the rest of the Council, Acharon acknowledged the Wrath's autonomy and the fact that the Sith Warrior served a power greater than the Council's one.[4] After the Wrath departed, Acharon's fellow Dark Councilor Darth Thanaton another matter before the council: he appealed to the other Councilors to destroy his rival and subordinate Lord Kallig, though the two dueled when the Council refused to fight Thanaton's battles. Acharon watched from Corellia as Kallig defeated Thanaton, and the Dark Councilors present on Korriban rewarded the young Sith with Thanaton's seat on the Dark Council.[5]
            In the later stages of the battle, Acharon remained in the Government District of Coronet City to guard the Ion Wall, a powerful weapon that could disable all electronics across a wide area. Cole Cantarus, an officer in the Corellian Security Force, briefly encountered Acharon during his time gathering information on the Imperial occupation forces. Cantarus' info, combined with the help of Councilor Belos—a member of Corellia's ruling Council—allowed the Republic to learn the location of the Ion Wall's transmitters and direct them at the Legislature Building instead of Republic forces. A Republic strike team then stormed the Intra-Corellian Intelligence building to reach the Ion Wall's controls, cutting through the Imperial soldiers that Acharon had stationed in the building. As the strike team reached the weapon's control room, Acharon decided to execute the officer in charge of defending the building because of his failure and choked the commander to death with the Force before tossing the man's body across the room as a display of his power. The Sith Lord then questioned the invaders as to the identity of their spy, but when the strike team refused to answer Acharon drew his red-bladed lightsaber and attacked. However, the Dark Councilor was ultimately no match for the combined strength of the strike team, and the Dark Councilor was struck down in battle with the Republic fighters.[1]
            A Human male with orange eyes and extensive cybernetic enhancements, Darth Acharon's pale skin was turned ashen gray on most of his face by the corrupting effects of the dark side of the Force. The Sith Lord was famous for his extremely cruel views on failure and sycophants, and he had no qualms about killing soldiers who failed him in any way. Acharon also despised subordinates who attempted to gain favor with him, treating them with the same disgust that he did incompetents.[1]
            Darth Acharon trained as a Sith Warrior and became proficient in both lightsaber combat and the use of the Force, skills that eventually led to his appointment to the Dark Council. He utilized both a single red-bladed lightsaber and offensive Force powers in battle, and his body was heavily augmented with cybernetic implants.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Acharon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthAcharon</string></dict>
        <key>Airen Cracken</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.931.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Airen Cracken was a male human who served as a general and as Chief of Rebel Intelligence in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.
            Even before the Alliance to Restore the Republic was established, the male human Airen Cracken was an accomplished freedom fighter. It was he who led the planetary militia that freed his homeworld from the oppression of the Galactic Empire, which led him to be fast-tracked to a general's commission within the Alliance Military.[3]
            By the time of the Battle of Scarif, Cracken served as the Chief of Rebel Intelligence.[4] Cracken was personally involved in setting up spy networks throughout the Outer Rim, so Rebel Intelligence was represented on the rebel council by one of his trusted field operatives, General Davits Draven.[5] Despite his absence, he still compiled a dossier regarding Operation Fracture at Mon Mothma's request.[4]
            Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, while serving in his capacity of Head of Security and Intelligence and confronted with the responsibility of rescuing three rebel spies in danger of capture by the Empire, Cracken showed reluctance in recruiting smuggler Han Solo for the mission. However, he was convinced by Princess Leia Organa, citing the fact that they were running out of options and out of time.[6]
            During the Battle of Endor, Cracken served aboard the Millennium Falcon with Lieutenant Blount.[7] The two were initially in the ship's cockpit with its pilot, General Lando Calrissian, co-pilot Nien Nunb, and a navigator,[1] but they soon manned the ship's quad turrets and served as gunners.[7]
            In Star Wars Legends continuity, the character of General Airen Cracken was created for the 1991 sourcebook Cracken's Rebel Field Guide,[8] and an unnamed Rebel aboard the Millennium Falcon in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, played by Michael Stevens,[9] was later consolidated with that character.[10] Current Star Wars continuity has maintained the identity of General Cracken for that Rebel from Jedi.[7]
            The 2018 reference book Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition states that Cracken was a spy and colonel who flew missions for General Crix Madine's Rebel Commandos during the Galactic Civil War and was later promoted to general and Chief of Rebel Intelligence.[11] This, however, contradicts various sources including Star Wars: The Rebel Files that had established Cracken was already Chief and a general since the early days of the Alliance.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Airen_Cracken</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAirenCracken</string></dict>

            At the age of two, Omin was discovered by the Jedi to be Force-sensitive, but was not taken in for training as he was considered to be too old by that point.
            During the last few years of the Galactic Republic, Omin served as a Senate Guard. He was the partner of Sagoro Autem, and served under Commander Zalin Bey. In 23 BBY, Omin and Autem investigated the murder of Senator Jheramahd Greyshade. It was discovered that Autem's brother was responsible, with unknowing help from his son, Reymet Autem. Sagoro planned on letting his son escape, and Omin was forced to arrest his partner.

Following a conspiracy against Darth Vader, Azoras, along with four other officers, were killed, with Vader stating that although he had suspicions on the conspirators, he would always survive.
            Tomas Azoras was an human male who served as an Imperial officer in the Imperial Officer Corps. Following an attempted assassination on Darth Vader on Cabarria by bounty hunters, Vader ordered his droid to conduct an analysis of the origins of the kill contract as they were arriving on Coruscant. The droid stated that the contract came from the highest levels of the Imperial Executive Building, including the offices of Emperor Palpatine. The droid continued, and stated that there was a 97% probability that the signal originated from there, and that there was no evidence of slicing.[1]
            Vader then requested a list of individuals with access codes of Imperial systems that were above Level 1A1. On the list provided, Azores' name popped up, along with the names of Corin Ferro, Wilhuff Tarkin, Cassio Tagge, Jer Croteau, Joon Strephi, and Zorta Bingan. Following a second assassination attempt in orbit that resulted in Vader and the Ninth Sister crashing their starship. After Vader met with the Emperor and meditated and discovered that Barokki was also involved, an officer he had force choked some time before, he approached the Emperor with a solution.[1]
            Azoras, along with many other officers, where called into an auditorium on Coruscant. Vader believed that the conspiracy against him was because the officers did not understand why Vader was Emperor Palpatine's second in command. Following a brief speech by Emperor Palpatine that elaborated that Vader was his voice and second in command, Vader "randomly" selected Azoras, along with Ferro, Strephi, Barokki, and Bingan and killed them through the Force, and stated that although he had suspicions on the conspirators, he would always survive. Of those killed, Barokki was one of two officers that were involved in the conspiracy, the other, who was an individual with two missing fingers was not selected and thus spared.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tomas_Azoras</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTomasAzoras</string></dict>
        <key>Adraas</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.934.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Adraas was a Human male Sith Lord around the time of the Great Galactic War and a rival of Darth Malgus. He was instrumental in the Battle of Ord Radama and the Sacking of Coruscant.
            The Sith Lord Adraas was sent to the battle on Ord Radama by the Emperor's advisory Dark Council, to provide Darth Malgus with assistance on the siege of the planet's capital, Livien Magnus. Malgus was angered by Adraas' presence on the planet and when Adraas suggested that they send some Mark I and Mark II Sith war droids to clear a path to the city, Malgus and Darth Venemal did nothing to dissuade him, despite having misgivings about the droids' abilities.[2]
            Under Adraas' orders, the droids attacked the city's southern gate and Malgus watched on as the droids were destroyed by the Republic defenders. However, the failure of the droids sufficiently distracted the Republic forces to allow Venemal and his commandos to enter the city and blast a hole in the wall. Livien Magnus quickly fell to Malgus' troops and Adraas subsequently tried to take all of the credit for the victory, which led Malgus to further despise his rival.[2]
            Adraas was chosen by Darth Angral to lead the fifty Sith warriors on board a stolen Republic shuttle for an attack on the Jedi Temple during the Sacking of Coruscant. All of these were Sith handpicked by Angral himself. The warriors ranged from Sith apprentices to Sith and were led by two Sith Lords, Adraas being one of them. His rival, Malgus, was to assist in the assault. Malgus had wished to lead the attack on the Temple alone, but was overruled by Angral, resulting in Adraas' being assigned to accompany Malgus. During the battle, Adraas used the Force to generate a shockwave, throwing back several Jedi and damaging the Temple floor on which they fought.[1]
            In the struggle, Adraas attempted to duel Jedi Master Ven Zallow, but was knocked out of the battle by his foe, allowing Darth Malgus to battle and ultimately kill Zallow. Following the success of their mission, Adraas was one of the many survivors of the strike force of Sith Warriors—much to the disappointment of Malgus. Adraas did not initially participate in the victory cries from the Sith Warriors, but ultimately did so. When Malgus retrieved his lover, Eleena Daru, he ordered Adraas to personally bring a medical team to tend to her wounds. Adraas also reported the success of the strike force's assault to Angral before Malgus dismissed him.[1]
            After the Imperial Medical Corps tended to the wounded and the dead were loaded onto their transport, Adraas approached Malgus on the matter of the Jedi's dead. Lord Malgus ultimately decided that they had fought bravely and that the Temple would become their tomb. When Adraas was ready to call an Imperial bomber to attack the Jedi Temple, Malgus ordered that explosives from the dropship be used to destroy the Temple. After the detonators were placed, Adraas believed they were too close to the blast radius. In response, Darth Malgus showed his contempt of Adraas protest and triggered the explosives using the Force to shield himself from the blast.[1]
            In defiance of Darth Malgus' orders to have his lover Daru immediately transported to the Steadfast, Lord Adraas instead redirected her to a local hospital overtaken by Sith soldiers. There she was left behind by other Imperials present who eventually moved their operation to a medical ship. Meanwhile, Darth Angral attempted to raise Malgus on his comlink, and when he failed to respond, Angral sought out Adraas, instead, and asked him to speak in Malgus' place. Elsewhere, Malgus was confronted twice by rogue Jedi Knight Aryn Leneer, and then later discovered the location of Eleena, as well as Adraas' treachery.[1]
            Upon finding Eleena, Malgus killed her—having understood that she was his weakness but not forgetting his feelings for her. Thereafter, upon leaving Coruscant, Darth Malgus cornered Adraas in his personal estate. Then, Adraas was overpowered in a lightsaber duel by his rival. Adraas then attempted to strike back using a variety of Force Powers, including Force Lightning as well, even though he was aware of Malgus's mastery of the Force. His attack was ultimately cut off by Malgus's barrage of Lightning attacks, which left the Sith Lord dying on the floor. With his final words, along with the pain the attack had inflicted upon him, a dying Adraas pleaded Malgus to kill him. Malgus complied, and after removing his gloves, ended the life of his long-time rival by choking him to death with his bare hands.[1]
            Adraas was an arrogant man and a rival of Darth Malgus. He enjoyed taunting Malgus, openly revealing his aspirations to take Malgus' position in the Sith hierarchy.[1]
            Adraas was skilled at political manipulation, drawing favor from Darth Angral, using it to impair Malgus' ability to act freely, then taunting him, knowing he could not strike back without open conflict.[1]
            Like many other Sith Lords, Adraas had misgivings about aliens.[1]
            Adraas was a skilled Sith warrior, though his favor of politics over combat would see his defeat and death at the hands of Malgus. He was more powerful than many of the Jedi at the Temple at Coruscant proven by his survival. However, this may be an assumption because little was known about his condition after the battle or how many he killed, but giving that he survived proved that he must have had some considerable skill.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Adraas</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAdraas</string></dict>

        <key>Ryder Azadi</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.936.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ryder Azadi was a human male who served as the Governor of Lothal during the early years of the Galactic Empire's reign over the Outer Rim planet. He supported the revolutionary broadcasts of Ephraim and Mira Bridger, leading to his arrest and imprisonment alongside the Bridgers. While in prison, he was labeled as "Prisoner X10." He escaped four years before the Battle of Yavin, after the Bridgers organized a prison break. The Bridgers were killed during their escape, so Azadi returned to Lothal to find their son, Ezra Bridger. Ezra, however, found him first after seeing him and his parents in a vision, so Azadi broke the news that his parents had been killed.
            Azadi continued helping Bridger's Spectres rebel cell and Phoenix Cell, which later joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In the years leading up to the Battle of Yavin, Azadi became the leader of a Lothal resistance group that aided the Alliance against Imperial forces on Lothal. Despite his initial misgiving about Ezra's leadership, Azadi would play an important role in the rebels' efforts to liberate Lothal from Imperial rule.
            Ryder Azadi hailed from the Outer Rim planet of Lothal, where he served as its governor during the early days of the Galactic Empire's rule there.[4]
            Around 18 BBY,[5] shortly after the Imperials arrived on Lothal, Governor Azadi was instructed to stop the Bridger transmissions within a month.[6]
            During his tenure as Governor of Lothal, Azadi discovered that a vein of doonium had been uncovered in the Pryce Mine. Hoping to gain control of the doonium vein before Senator Domus Renking and the Empire could get their hands on it, Azadi sent his representative Arik Uvis to buy a controlling interest from owner Arihnda Pryce. Pryce, disinterested in letting someone outside of the Pryce family control the mine, turned down Azadi's offer, throwing Uvis out of the mine when he refused to relent.[4]
            In retribution for Pryce's refusal of his offer, Azadi and Uvis falsified embezzlement charges that led to the arrest of Elainye Pryce. When Pryce went to Renking's office to appeal for her mother's release, he confirmed that Elainye would be held by Azadi until proven innocent and he could not be convinced otherwise. Azadi's attempted takeover failed when Pryce turned the mine over to the Empire and Renking in exchange for her mother's release and a job on Coruscant.[4]
            Despite being a member of the Imperial government, Azadi supported underground revolutionary broadcasts that were made by Ephraim and Mira Bridger. As a result of his actions, Azadi was charged with treason and incarcerated in an Imperial prison, along with the Bridgers. Azadi was given the label "Prisoner X10" while he was imprisoned.[1] Governor Azadi's "forced retirement" and imprisonment coincided with Arihnda Pryce winning Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's favor by disclosing the Higher Skies Advocacy Group's illegal espionage activities against the Empire and Moff Ghadi's attempt to use this intelligence to gain advantage over Tarkin. As a reward, Pryce was made the new Governor of Lothal. She oversaw the expansion of Imperial industry, mining, and military bases on Lothal, which under her rule became a major center of Imperial power in that region of the galaxy. Azadi's office was looted by his former associates. One of his former ministers Maketh Tua continued serving Governor Pryce as Lothal's Minister of Industrial Production.[4]
            In approximately 4 BBY,[source?] the Bridgers' son, Ezra, had become part of a rebel cell that fought the Empire on Lothal. He sent out a message of rebellion to the people of Lothal, one that also reached the ears of prisoners like Azadi and the Bridgers. This inspired the Bridgers to rally Azadi and fellow inmates to escape. Azadi was able to escape from the prison, but the Bridgers lost their lives during the attempt. Azadi returned to Lothal in the hopes of finding Ezra, so he could tell the boy what happened to his parents, and Ezra likewise traveled to Lothal from Garel after seeing his parents and Azadi in a vision. Ezra found the former governor in a stone circle on Lothal, though Azadi did not know who it was at first and fired a blaster rifle at Ezra and his Jedi master, Kanan Jarrus.[1]
            Ezra managed to calm Azadi down by telling him that he was the son of Ephraim and Mira Bridger. Satisfied, Azadi led Ezra, Kanan, and the astromech droid Chopper into the stone circle which served as his adobe. There, the former Governor told Ezra about his connection to his parents. He also informed Ezra that his broadcast had inspired his parents to stage an escape but that they had perished during the attempt. Azadi then stayed inside the stone circle while Ezra went out into the open to grief his parents' deaths. While Ezra was devastated by the loss of his parents, he was able to come to terms with his grief after he encountered them during a Force vision.[1]
            Ryder stayed behind with Chopper while Ezra and Kanan traveled to the town of Jalath to greet Princess Leia Organa, the daughter of the Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa, who was delivering three Sphyrna-class corvette to the rebellion. Kanan and Ezra had invited him to come along with them but Ryder did not want to expose himself to the Empire. While Ezra and Kanan were away, Ryder and Chopper were captured by a group of stormtroopers, who had orders to execute Ryder. Before the Imperials could take their prisoners into the custody, they were ambushed by Ezra, Kanan, Leia, and the other crew of the Ghost. Following a brief skirmish, Ryder and his rescuers fled aboard the Ghost; with Ezra and Kanan disguised as a kidnapped Imperial cadet and stormtrooper respectively. To hide Leia's dealings with the rebels, Ryder pretended to "kidnap" the Alderaanian princess.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ryder_Azadi</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRyderAzadi</string></dict>
        <key>Mytus Adema</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.937.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mytus Adema was a human who served the Galactic Empire as a lieutenant in the Citadel Tower on the planet Scarif. An ambitious man who disliked his superior officer, General Sotorus Ramda, Adema hoped to one day make a damning report on the general's behavior. Adema was on duty in the Citadel's command center in 0 BBY, when Director Orson Krennic of Imperial Advanced Weapons Research arrived to retrieve information on communications made by scientist Galen Erso.
            Shortly after Krennic's arrival, a series of explosions visible from the command center marked the beginning of a Rebel Alliance attack on the Citadel aimed at stealing the plans for the Death Star superweapon. During the fighting, Adema was fooled by false reports of rebel activity on several of the Citadel's landing pads but also reported to Krennic the rebels' genuine attempt to access the tower's data vault. Foiling Krennic's efforts to stop them, the rebels successfully transmitted the plans to the Alliance Fleet in orbit, before the Death Star itself obliterated the Citadel with a blast from its superlaser.
            Mytus Adema was a human male lieutenant in the service of the Galactic Empire.[2] In the year 0 BBY,[3] Adema was stationed in the Citadel Tower on the planet Scarif under the command of[1] General Sotorus Ramda.[2] He was present in the Citadel's command center when Director Orson Krennic[1] of the Empire's Advanced Weapons Research division[2] arrived there to retrieve from the facility's archives all recorded correspondence ever sent by Imperial scientist Galen Erso.[1] Krennic's order caused Adema and every other officer in the room, save Ramda, to flinch due to the sheer number of records involved.[4]
            As Krennic waited for the correspondence to be delivered, a series of distant explosions visible from the command center were set off by a team of Rebel Alliance soldiers that had infiltrated Scarif's defenses in order to steal the plans for the Death Star superweapon from the Citadel. Adema and the other Imperials in the command center watched in shocked silence through the room's viewport until Krennic yelled at them to mobilize the Citadel's stormtrooper garrison and respond to the attack.[1]
            As fighting broke out between the rebel and Imperial forces around the Citadel, Adema began receiving requests for help and anomalous reports of large numbers of rebel attackers sighted at several of the Citadel's landing pads. Some of these reports were genuine, but others, including those from Pad Two and Pad Five, were false attempts by defected Imperial pilot Bodhi Rook and fellow rebel[1] Corporal Stordan Tonc[2] from aboard the stolen Imperial cargo shuttle SW-0608 on pad nine to distract the Imperial forces. Adema fell for the ruse and, after asking for confirmation from Pads Twelve, Ten, and Eight, ordered that men be sent to Pad Five, where no rebels were actually fighting.[1]
            Shortly after being fooled, Adema received a report of unauthorized access in the Citadel's data vault, as a three-person rebel team had sneaked inside the tower to find the Death Star plans while the battle raged outside as a diversion. Adema immediately reported the new development to Krennic,[1] who was reading through the Galen Erso correspondences he had received so far.[5] Krennic quickly worked out what was happening and left to confront the rebels in the vault with two[1] death troopers.[2]
            In an attempt to prevent the battle station's plans from falling into rebel hands, the Empire destroyed the Citadel soon after with the Death Star's superlaser. Nevertheless, the rebels on the ground succeeded in transmitting the stolen plans from the planet's surface to the Alliance Fleet in orbit prior to their deaths,[1] ultimately allowing the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin.[6]
            Mytus Adema was a purposeful and unusually ambitious young officer who disdained General Ramda's command of the Citadel Tower[2] as overconfident and lazy.[7] Adema watched his commanding officer's actions closely in the hopes of one day being able to provide a damning report on the general,[2] thus supplanting him in the eyes of Director Krennic.[7]
            Adema considered the Death Star a welcome[7] and potent symbol of Imperial might that should be respected.[2] When reporting the unauthorized access of the Citadel's data vault to Krennic, Adema's head twitched to the side, seeking support from other officers in the control center, but he received none.[5] Adema had light skin, green eyes, and brown hair.[1]
            While on duty at the Citadel Tower, Adema wore a standard gaberwool Imperial officer's uniform, including a cap. He carried a private datapad in a shockproof case on his belt and wore a code cylinder and a rank insignia plaque on his breast. The plaque showed two red squares and one blue.[2]
            Lieutenant Adema was portrayed by Jack Roth in the 2016 Anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The character's name was listed in the film's credits despite never being spoken in the film itself.[1] Adema's first name, Mytus, was then revealed in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo[2] and published the same day as the film's release, December 16, 2016.[8] The film's novelization, written by Alexander Freed,[5] includes additional lines of dialogue for Adema when he speaks with Director Krennic[5] that are not present in the film.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mytus_Adema</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMytusAdema</string></dict>
        <key>Maxiron Agolerga</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.938.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Maxiron Agolerga was a Human male native of Naboo and the Pontifex of the Brotherhood of Cognizance. In 22 BBY, he was approached by a woman who identified herself as "Veré", who wished to be married to a man identified as "Set". Agolerga agreed to perform the ceremony, and did so at Varykino, Lake Country. The young couple insisted that their union be kept a secret, and so Agolerga kept only limited records of it.
            Maxiron Agolerga was the Pontifex of the Brotherhood of Cognizance, an arcane religious order of approximately twenty members that resided in Naboo's mountains.[1] Agolerga counted among his friends the Naberrie family,[3] and in 22 BBY, he was approached by the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, who were presenting a private holographic message. Agolerga accepted the message, which contained an image of a young woman who was requesting that he perform a secret marriage. The Pontifex was surprised by the request, as no member of the Brotherhood had presided over a marriage for 300 years, since civil ceremonies had become popular during the reign of King Narmlé.[1]
            Agolerga accepted the task, and donned his holy purple robes, before the two droids led him to a Gondola Speeder, and took him to Varykino, an estate on the other side of the Lake Country. There, the Pontifex met the young couple, who identified themselves as "Veré" and "Set", named for the fabled Veré and Set, lovers in an old Futhork legend. After a brief ceremony, Agolerga pronounced the couple husband and wife. Before he departed Varykino, "Set" instructed the Pontifex not to tell anyone of their union, and so the only record Agolerga maintained of their matrimony was kept on a scroll in the Brotherhood's archives.[1]
            Agolerga later recorded the event once again, this time in a databook. When it was learned that the people he had wed were Senator Padmé Amidala and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, he passed the information onto Amidala's niece, Pooja Naberrie.[3] The information, however, had not been kept as much of a secret as Agolerga thought, as both a member of the civil clergy[4] and Captain Quarsh Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces had discovered it, and seen fit to inform Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who used the information to bend Skywalker to his will in 19 BBY.[5]
            Despite the fact that he had been summoned to perform a wedding he knew nothing about, Agolerga was willing to take part in the ceremony. He was surprised that he, a member of a largely forgotten religion, was being tasked with marrying two people.[1]
            Maxiron Agolerga first appeared, as the "Naboo Holy Man," in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones. According to the website IMDb.com, Agolerga would have been portrayed by Giulio Alimenti.[6] In Matthew Stover's novelization of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, it is implied that a member of Naboo's civil clergy weds Skywalker and Amidala, which conflicted with the "holyman," identified in the various Attack of the Clones adaptations. The character was also identified as a holyman in The Rise and Fall of Darth Vader, The New Essential Chronology, and Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels.
            Through StarWars.com's Hyperspace feature What's The Story?, Tim Veekhoven, writing as "Sompeetalay," identified the character and elaborated upon his story. Since Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force, which had identified the character as a friend of the Naberries, had been released after he had written the entry, but before it was published, Veekhoven was unable to reference it in his work. He derived the character's name from that of Manuel Aringarosa, a character from Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Maxiron_Agolerga</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMaxironAgolerga</string></dict>

        <key>Abran Balfour</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.941.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Abran Balfour was the Imperial Moff of the Parmic sector, whose forces constantly patrolled the Llanic Spice Run. Balfour operated from a fortress at the space station Spice Terminus, where he kept a private collection of exotic non-sentient species. Derided as an inefficient and apathetic governor, Balfour was less interested in political and military matters than he was with restoring the vintage space barge known as the Lady Telura. The restoration led him to pursue rare ship parts, and he found himself in contact with organizations such as The Most Honourable Guild of Armourers. Due to his unorthodox order of priorities, Moffs of bordering sectors constantly criticized Balfour, though his lax attitude alone left him bereft of true enemies.
            He soon became notorious for his attitude, and was the subject of several political songs, "Moff Balfour's Lament (Tapmint Surprise)" among them. Nonetheless, he was undeterred, and had the utmost faith in the security of his sector. Eventually, his faith was shaken when Parmic became a nexus of Imperial activity following reported Rebel strikes and rumors of a Mandalorian presence in the sector. Eventually, Balfour was deposed by a mercenary group, the Laramus Base Irregulars. His holdings were later investigated by operatives working for the ascendant New Republic.
            Due to his complete lack of political knowledge, and the fact that he was bereft of charisma, Moff Abran Balfour was relegated to controlling the backwater Parmic sector for the Galactic Empire. Balfour governed the sector from the space station Spice Terminus, where he had a private fortress. There, he kept a wide collection of rare and exotic non-sentient creatures.[2]
            Instead of properly governing the sector, Balfour preferred to ignore enemy activity and work on restoring the vintage Thalassian space barge Lady Telura. The ship was a rare model and required an assortment of very rare parts in order to be properly restored. Balfour would often journey far from the sector capital hunting for parts to restore the ship, and would enlist the help of The Most Honourable Guild of Armourers in his search. If he ever needed to return to the Parmic sector, his position afforded him a fast ship in case of emergency, although Balfour was usually warned well in advance if a situation arose. Due to his shifted priorities, Balfour was more than happy to let the planetary governors do their work with little guidance from him.[1]
            During this time, according to Galactic Weekly NewsStack, Balfour managed to start a Gamorrean clan war by uttering the word "oink," which, unbeknownst to the Moff, was a deadly insult in their native tongue. He was also the target of political protest songs from the banned musical groups "Red Shift Limit" and "Deeply Religious," who released "Moff Balfour's Lament (Tapmint Surprise)."[1] Security in certain parts of the sector was so lax that at one stage that Balfour's undergarments were apprehended by an ordinance procurer.[3] His ineptitude was such that smuggling became an easy option for criminals in the Parmic sector, and some believed that the Moff simply had no idea how to do his job.[4] When the issue of Alliance to Restore the Republic activity in his sector was raised, Balfour would dismiss it, choosing to ignore such a possibility in the hope that it would subside.[1]
            Since the troops under Balfour's command were well equipped, they were able to keep the sector relatively free of Rebel operations despite his lack of participation. His forces constantly patrolled the Llanic Spice Run, which was the only locale of note in the sector. While his apathy gained him few supporters, Balfour likewise had very few enemies, save for the Moffs of neighboring sectors who thought that his laid back modus operandi could be dangerous. Balfour was also apparently under surveillance from the Imperial Security Bureau, who had inserted their agent, Elena Shelvay, as one of the Moff's aides.[1]
            Content that his sector was secure from Rebel activity, Balfour's seemingly easy job became very difficult in short order, due to staff incompetence, Rebel coordination, and rumors of a Mandalorian battlecruiser adrift in the area. Soon, the Parmic sector was alive with Imperial activity, and was deemed a "danger zone."[1] Eventually, Galactic Emperor Palpatine died at the Battle of Endor, and those left with power on Imperial Center found themselves squabbling for total dominion over the now fragmented Empire.[5] The militant mercenary group known as the Laramus Base Irregulars were able to topple Balfour's control over the Parmic sector, and soon after, Voren Na'al, a historian working for the New Republic, was sent to peruse the former Moff's records at the Spice Terminus fortress. In doing so, he activated one of Balfour's traps, but emerged unscathed.[2]
            Abran Balfour differed from his colleagues in that he maintained an unkempt appearance, lacked charisma, was unfit, and was notably poor at politics. As such, he was relegated to the backwater Parmic sector. Personally, Balfour saw himself as a knowledgeable historian, and an able politician. Conversely, he was unable to gain the respect of the Imperial troops under his command, a situation that proved disastrous when the Parmic sector garnered Alliance attention. Even when it did, Balfour had an apathetic stance toward the threat and would always caution his men to ignore any dissident activity.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Abran_Balfour/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAbranBalfour</string></dict>

Trusted by Karrde because he had the trust of the crew, Aves was never very far from the smuggler chief and served aboard Wild Karrde in communications and dispatch. He provided Karrde with advice on the mood of his employees, who often confided in Aves if they were uncomfortable talking to Karrde himself. Aves would then pass along those concerns—without naming names—to Karrde, secure in the knowledge that Karrde wouldn't use the information against them.

        <key>TX-828</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.944.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>TX-828, known to his comrades as "Torrent," was a clone who was bred in the final years of the Galactic Republic. Following the formation of the Galactic Empire, TX-828 served as a sergeant in the Stormtrooper Corps and worked with Imperial Security Bureau Senior Commander Alecia Beck. By 0 BBY, TX-828 and Beck began tracking the Shrikes, special operatives in the Rebel Alliance, eventually locating the group on the planet Taanab. In 0 ABY, TX-828 led an ambush against the Shrikes, but one, Caluan Ematt, escaped.
            Leading an investigation, TX-828 tracked Ematt to the planet Cyrkon. Through bounty hunters searching for the smuggler Han Solo, the stormtrooper sergeant discovered that Ematt was planning to be rescued by Solo and the Wookiee Chewbacca. TX-828 and Beck set a trap for the rebels outside of their starship, the Millennium Falcon, and managed to capture Ematt, Solo, and Chewbacca. However, TX-828 and Beck ultimately lost custody of the trio when rebel sympathizers aboard the yacht Miss Fortune fired upon TX-828's stormtrooper squads, allowing the three fugitives to escape aboard the Millennium Falcon. In an attempt to recapture the rebels, TX-828 and Beck returned to the Star Destroyer Vehement and briefly pursued the Millennium Falcon before it finally escaped into hyperspace.
            Prior to the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY,[4] Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas commissioned Kaminoan scientists to create clone troopers to form the Grand Army of the Republic.[2] TX-828 was one of the final clones to be bred on the planet Kamino, and at some point during his service[1] in the clone army,[3] he gained the nickname "Torrent."[1] In 19 BBY, the Galactic Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire,[4] and due to the accelerated aging of clone troopers and his late production, TX-828 became one of the last few in service.[1]
            By 0 BBY,[5] TX-828 had been promoted to sergeant, and he served under Imperial Security Bureau Senior Commander Alecia Beck, stationed aboard the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Vehement. During this time, Beck had been tracking the Shrikes, operatives for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and she traced the rebel cell to the planet Taanab, where she hoped to observe their actions and learn information about Alliance High Command.[1]
            The morning after the Battle of Yavin, in 0 ABY,[5] ISB officials received a communiqué from Coruscant with an order from Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine: apprehend all suspected members and sympathizers of the Rebel Alliance. Following the new order, TX-828, directed by Beck, led a troop of eight stormtroopers to ambush the Shrikes as they attempted to escape aboard an EE-730 transport. With their E-11 blaster rifles set to stun, TX-828 and his fellow soldiers engaged the rebels in a brief firefight that lasted less than ten seconds. TX-828 and his squad captured four rebel troopers, but a Rodian rebel had eluded capture, and the alien shot the unconscious men and women before committing suicide. Beck, convinced that the action was taken to protect rebel secrets, had TX-828 search the starship. TX-828 believed the rebels were all accounted for, but Beck was certain a sixth, Caluan Ematt, had escaped.[1]
            Following Beck's order, TX-828 had an additional ten squads from the Vehement search the hangars and local cantinas, before sending a scanning crew to deliver the data to the ISB officer. When Beck received the data, she noted that the logs from the ship's navigation computer were absent. Beck subsequently contacted TX-828, who affirmed that both the ship's computer and hyperspace logs had been wiped. After the update, Beck was notified that three ships had slipped through the planet's Imperial blockade. Deducing that Ematt was aboard one, a MK I bulk transport, Beck contacted the Vehement's captain, Hove, and a course was set for the transport's destination: Cyrkon, a crime-ridden planet in Hutt Space.[1]
            Arriving at Cyrkon, Beck led TX-828 and a squad to Motok, the planet's capital. In the city, the group began searching for Ematt, eventually arriving at a cantina. Upon Beck's word, TX-828 commanded the stormtroopers to line the bar patrons against the wall and shoot if they resisted. As two of the stormtroopers began searching the patrons for weapons, Beck explained that she was looking for Ematt. When a Twi'lek claimed that none of them had seen Ematt, Beck called the man on his lie, and she had TX-828 take the alien out of the bar.[1]
            Continuing the interrogation, Beck threatened the Twi'lek, who began to comply. When Beck asked the alien if he knew Ematt was a rebel, the Twi'lek said that he had suspected so. Beck stated that all rebel sympathizers were to be shot on sight, and TX-828 fired upon the Twi'lek. As TX-828 moved the body, Beck learned from Captain Hove that a marked YT-1300 light freighter under the alias "Lost and Found" had landed in Motok. Inferring that the ship was attempting to rescue Ematt, Beck informed the sergeant, and the squad raced to the suspect hangar.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/TX-828</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTX828</string></dict>

        <key>TK-555</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.946.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>TK-555 was a stormtrooper.
            TK-555 was personally responsible for counting and packaging Order 66 Cookies for Empire Day in 1 ABY. He was also visibly overweight, most likely as a result of abusing this position. At some point before Life Day in 1 ABY, he earned a favor from Watto, a junk dealer in Mos Espa.
            Just before the Life Day festivities in 1 ABY, a shipment of Life Day candy was stolen by Jawas while being transported to Saun Dann. TK-555 then took this candy from the Jawas, who believed him to be some sort of ghost, presumably due to his white armor, and transported it to the Mos Espa Podracer Cantina where he consumed large quantities of it.
            An unidentified spacer, on an assignment from Saun Dann to track the candy, confronted TK-555 in the Mos Espa cantina. TK-555 was remorseful for having appropriated candy originally destined for poor children. In exchange for the spacer's agreement not to report the stormtrooper to his superiors, TK-555 offered to call in the favor he was owed by Watto to sell the spacer a Single Trooper Aerial Platform for a discounted price. The spacer took the deal, but also demanded that TK-555 donate 10,000 credits to the Mos Espa orphanage.
            During another Life Day event, a similar situation occurred to the prior event. That time, however, a spacer (presumably the same one) decided against telling him off and instead told Saun Dann about what happened.
            Following this incident, TK-555 captivated the interest of the public, having a bobble head toy designed after him.
            TK-555 originally appeared as a non-interactive Non-Player Character (NPC) in the Empire Day celebration in Star Wars Galaxies in 2008. At that time, the game was understood to take place entirely in 1 ABY, therefore placing TK-555's Empire Day appearance in that timeframe. For the 2008 Life Day event, the developers decided to bring him back as he was popular with players. He made an appearance in following Life Day events, and was even added as a "storyteller" character for the 2010 event. This allowed players to include TK-555 in their player-made events for the duration of the Life Day festivities.
            He also made appearances in successive Empire Day celebrations. During the Empire Day celebration in 2009, the developers introduced a bobblehead TK-555 for players who partake in the Star Wars Galaxies "E-Mail Collection." The description alludes to both this and the status as a bobblehead doll by jokingly saying that TK-555's popularity had "gone to his head."</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/TK-555</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTK555</string></dict>

            Following General Hera Syndulla's failed attempt to destroy the TIE/D Defender factory, LS-261 and another stormtrooper were tasked with guarding Hera Syndulla while Governor Arihnda Pryce interrogated the Rebel Alliance leader.

        <key>CR978</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.953.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>CR978 was a human male who served as a TIE fighter pilot in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. Following the Battle of Hoth, CR978 was sent with three other pilots to capture the Millennium Falcon after it fled into the Hoth asteroid belt. Imperial Lieutenant Commander Ciena Ree provided support for the four pilots from on board the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor, but even with her aid CR978 crashed his TIE/ln space superiority starfighter into an asteroid.
            The human male designated as CR978 served in the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire as a TIE fighter pilot during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[2] He was stationed on board one of six Imperial-class Star Destroyer, that traveled to the Hoth system in order to attack Echo Base, a Rebel base located on the planet Hoth. The Alliance was forced to flee from the Empire's superior forces on the surface of Hoth, but the Imperial fleet was unable to prevent the Rebel transports from escaping due to protection provided by an ion cannon on Hoth. Following the Empire's victory, the Sith Lord Darth Vader demanded that at least three of the six Imperial-class Star Destroyers, chase and capture the YT-1300 light freighter named the Millennium Falcon specifically.[1]
            With the three Destroyers in pursuit the Falcon fled into the Hoth asteroid belt, which was located in the Hoth system, in the hopes of shaking them off by hiding. Unable to give effective pursuit itself, the Star Destroyer that CR978 was stationed on board deployed him and three other TIE pilots in TIE/ln space superiority starfighters.[1] Entering such a belt in an unshielded craft was practically a suicide mission for the four pilots, and Lieutenant Commander Ciena Ree was assigned to provide auxiliary navigational assistance to CR978 and his comrades from on board the bridge of Vader's personal flagship, the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor. As the four TIEs chased the Falcon through the asteroids, Ree warned CR978 that he needed to pull his craft up to avoid collision with an asteroid, but the pilot was too slow and his vessel exploded upon impact, hurling his body into space and killing him. CR978's three comrades, JA189, OL701 and NA811[2] all eventually crashed as well, allowing the Falcon to hide and eventually escape the Imperials entirely.[1] Disheartened by the deaths of the four pilots, Ree was surprised when she was complimented on her work by the commanding officer of the Executor, Admiral Firmus Piett. Since the Admiral had assumed the pilots had never stood a chance anyway, he was impressed that Ree had managed to keep them alive longer than they would have survived on their own.[2]
            CR978 first appeared in the original release of Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back in 1980, and is the only TIE pilot to actually do so. CR978 was first identified in the novel Lost Stars, which was written by Claudia Gray and released in 2015.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/CR978</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCR978</string></dict>

        <key>Col Serra</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.955.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Col Serra, a Human male, was a smuggler who operated during the Galactic Civil War and was an old friend of another smuggler, Han Solo. After the Battle of Yavin, Serra was asked by Solo, who had joined the Rebel Alliance, to assemble a new unit of trained soldiers for the Rebellion. Serra scoured the galaxy, recruiting a ragtag bunch of scoundrels, pirates, bounty hunters, and other outlaws, forming Renegade Squadron in the process. Serra himself became the commander of the new unit. The Renegades first saw action during the evacuation of the Rebel base on Yavin 4, where they acted as a cover for the retreating Rebel troops, who fled from the invading forces of the Galactic Empire. During the battle, Serra was assisted by the Force-sensitive clone trooper X2, and the two of them managed to take down an Imperial-class Star Destroyer by destroying its reactor core. Following the evacuation, Serra and Renegade Squadron helped Commander Gial Ackbar to find a suitable location for a new Rebel base. Once it was established on the planet Boz Pity, though, the Rebels had to escape again, as the Empire had followed them to the planet.
            When the Alliance had finally settled on Hoth, Serra and Renegade Squadron began carrying out constant strikes against the Empire. They attacked an Imperial starship repair facility on Rori, and an Imperial weapons depot on Naboo. During the latter mission, Serra and his men uncovered evidence about a new Imperial superweapon, the superlaser-equipped Star Destroyer Conqueror. Serra and Renegade Squadron undertook a daring mission to the Mustafar system to destroy the Conqueror and successfully carried out their objective despite the intervention of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader himself. When the Empire finally discovered Echo Base on Hoth in 3 ABY, Serra and the Renegades once again assumed the role of a rearguard for the Rebel evacuation, planting explosives throughout the base and escaping in the last moment before its destruction.
            One year later, Serra's squadron played a crucial role in both the run-up to the Battle of Endor and the battle itself, during which they assisted Solo's strike team in destroying the shield generator bunker that projected the deflector shield protecting the second Imperial Death Star. On Endor, Serra once again teamed up with X2, and together they helped Rebel ground and space forces, sabotaging the Imperial communications network and taking down shields of enemy Star Destroyers. After the battle was won by the Alliance, Serra and his men disbanded Renegade Squadron, returning to their underworld activities. Many years later, Serra was located by the Jedi archivist Tionne, who was compiling a record on Renegade Squadron. Serra then told her about his and his squadron's role in the Rebellion's fight against the Empire.
            Col Serra was a Human male smuggler active during the Galactic Civil War, who was friends with fellow smuggler Han Solo. At some point in his life, Serra lost his left eye and replaced it with a cybernetic patch. In 0 ABY, Solo—now allied with the Rebel Alliance—asked Serra to recruit soldiers that did not need any additional training in order to strengthen the defenses of the Alliance base on Yavin 4, which was soon going to be attacked by the Galactic Empire in retaliation for the destruction of the Death Star superweapon by the Rebels. At the time, the Alliance was mostly made up of farmboys and dreamers, and the Rebellion needed a force of formidable fighters[1] who knew military tactics and could follow orders without question. Serra accepted the mission and began searching the galaxy for the right mix of pirates, bounty hunters, and other renegades who would agree to fight for the Alliance.[2] It turned out to be somewhat easy work, due to the abundance of individuals in the galaxy who hated the Empire.[1] Unexpectedly for Serra, many of the recruits even brought their own stolen starfighters for the cause.[3]
            Soon enough, Serra's task was complete, and he found the right amount of soldiers. Most of them were wanted men who had been on the run from bounty hunters and were used to keeping a low profile, so they made sure that there were no records of them in the Alliance archives. Serra then became the commander of Renegade Squadron—as the newly formed unit had been christened—and together with Solo, started to prepare them to fight against the Empire. Soon after the formation of the squadron, the Yavin base was invaded, forcing the Alliance to begin a full-scale evacuation. Renegade Squadron acted as a cover for the retreating forces and pushed the invading enemy back from the Alliance's main base temple, but one Imperial scout trooper infiltrated the temple and stole the Alliance communication codes. Renegade Squadron hunted down the trooper and returned the logs back to the temple. After destroying all databanks with sensitive information to prevent it from falling into enemy hands,[1] the Renegades and Serra boarded their X-wing starfighters and joined the battle in space, where they engaged an Imperial-class Star Destroyer.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Col_Serra</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascColSerra</string></dict>

            During his Imperial service, TK-577 believed in what he was fighting for as much as any recruit of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[2] Despite that, he still deserted the Empire following the Battle of Yavin, and became a highly wanted fugitive. As of his time as a fugitive, TK-577 was completely bald with brown eyebrows. His eyes were also brown in color, and he had fair skin.[1]
            During TK-577's time in the Stormtrooper Corps, he was armed with a BlasTech E-11 blaster rifle.[3] After deserting the Empire, however, TK-577 made use of a DL-44 XT blaster pistol and a vibroknuckler for close range combat.[1]
            TK-577 was created by Decipher, Inc.'s Jedi Knights Trading Card Game in 2001.[3][2] He later appeared as a non-player character in the 2003 video game Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Sony Online Entertainment and published by LucasArts.[1] He was added to the game as part of Game Update 3's Dangerous Fugitives addition in April 29, 2008.[4] The game was shut down on December 15, 2011.[5]
            Players of the bounty hunter profession who were level 86 or higher could use a bounty check ability to discover ten fugitives hiding throughout the galaxy. One of these fugitives was TK-577. Bounty hunter players who defeated all ten fugitives in the Dangerous Fugitives collection were awarded with a Master Crafted EE-3 Carbine Schematic and a Master Crafted DC-15 Rifle Schematic. Players who completed the collection could speak to a Trandoshan bounty hunter named Rovessh in the Bestine cantina to reset the collection, allowing players to repeatedly hunt down and kill TK-577 and the other nine fugitives. Although the player could choose not to hunt down and kill TK-577, this article assumes 100% game completion.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/TK-577</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTK577</string></dict>

        <key>Guila Angira</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.959.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Guila Angira was a human male lieutenant in the Resistance fleet during their war against the First Order. In 34 ABY, he served on the bridge of the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus under Captain Idrosen Gawat during the evacuation of the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar and died when the First Order destroyed the bridge in an attack on the fleet after it exited hyperspace following the lightspeed jump from D'Qar.
            Guila Angira[3] was a human male who served in the Resistance during their war against the First Order. After the Resistance successfully destroyed the First Order's Starkiller Base[2] in the year 34 ABY,[1] Angira was amongst the Resistance military forces that evacuated from their base on the planet D'Qar.[2] During the evacuation, he held the rank of lieutenant and served as the gunnery officer on the bridge of the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus under the command of Captain Idrosen Gawat.[3]
            As the Resistance transported its last personnel off D'Qar, the First Order fleet arrived and attacked, but after the Resistance's forces successfully destroyed the First Order Dreadnought[2] Fulminatrix,[3] the Raddus successfully jumped to lightspeed with the rest of the Resistance forces and escaped.[2]
            Much to the surprise of the Resistance's commanders, the First Order managed to track them through lightspeed and quickly caught up with them after the Raddus and other vessels exited hyperspace. In the attack that followed, Angira was killed along with most of the highest ranking members of the Resistance when the bridge of the Raddus was destroyed by missiles fired from two TIE/fo space superiority fighters. Those on the bridge who were not killed in the initial blast were sucked out into the vacuum of space, with only General Leia Organa managing to survive the ordeal.[2]
            Angira had dark skin, brown eyes and black hair.[2]
            While on the Raddus, the lieutenant wore a brown, brimoss-fibre uniform tunic with black pants, a brown belt and a pair of brown service boots.[3]
            Guila Angira was portrayed by Aki Omoshaybi in the film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi,[2] which was released on December 15, 2017.[5] The character was not named in the film,[2] but received identification in Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo[3] and released in conjunction with the film.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Guila_Angira</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGuilaAngira</string></dict>

            The trooper soon discovered a device which Lumpawarrump had made to fool the others into returning to base, which he destroyed. B4711 then chased Lumpy out onto the deck of the home, where he was met by Chewbacca and Han Solo, who had just arrived for the Life Day celebration. Solo tripped the trooper, and B4711 fell to his death in the forest below.

        <key>Ardus Kaine</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.961.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ardus Kaine was an Imperial Moff and the successor of Wilhuff Tarkin as Grand Moff of Oversector Outer following Tarkin's death after the Battle of Yavin. His flagship was the Reaper. Following the Battle of Endor, Kaine formed the Pentastar Alignment.
            Ardus Kaine was a Human male native to the Outer Rim world of Sartinaynian in the Braxant sector.[1] The son of successful trader and speciesist Vilardo Kaine, Kaine had all of his father's misplaced ambitions foisted upon him, despite the fact that he wasn't particularly non-human and was given more to co-operation than giving orders. However, his father saw his ascending the highest echelons of political society. Despite not particularly agreeing with his father, he worked hard to please him, eventually becoming involved in politics. [5]
            A strong character and noted public speaker, Kaine was involved in the politics and administration of the Galactic Republic, becoming one of the earliest, most ardent supporters of Naboo Senator Palpatine, embracing his philosophy wholeheartedly after his father was killed in a pirate attack. [6] Kaine remained at the Senator's side as Palpatine was elected Supreme Chancellor; when Palpatine reorganized the Republic into the first Galactic Empire, Kaine adopted the principles of the New Order with fanaticism. His leadership and organizational skills came to the fore in the Imperial Period, during which Kaine played a key role in administrative reform. Immediately after the Declaration of the New Order, he was instrumental in ensuring the Grand Army of the Republic's support for the new regime. Kaine worked alongside the likes of Crueya Vandron, Ishin-Il-Raz and Janus Greejatus in the formation of the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order, after concerns about the administration of Imperial Intelligence, viewing it as something his father would have been proud of.[7] Kaine quickly became disillusioned with the COMPNOR project, however, viewing the organization's constant feuding with Imperial Intelligence as a waste of valuable Imperial time and effort.[4] It was around this time he began a lifelong feud with Ennix Devian: he viewed Devian as a cruel, brutal thug. Devian, in turn saw Kaine as pompous and uncommitted to Human High Culture - something, ironically, that was correct.[8]
            For his loyal and productive Imperial servitude, Kaine was appointed governor of several worlds, and later a moff.[4] Extremely wealthy, Kaine at some point became a corporate backer of the Imperial Inquisitor Jerec.[9] After Wilhuff Tarkin's death at the Battle of Yavin, he became Grand Moff of Oversector Outer. While this offered him a prestigious title and control over a huge region of the Outer Rim Territories, Kaine saw his promotion as a personal rebuke: he wanted to be near Palpatine on Imperial Center, assisting in important Imperial policies, not tucked away in the farthest fringes of the Empire trying to repair the damage left by Tarkin's death - even his enemy Devian had managed to be closer to the halls of power.[10] With Kaine's new title came command of the Outer Rim Imperial Fleet and the elite Scourge Squadron,[3] a considerable force of Star Destroyers tasked with rooting out and quelling Rebel Alliance activity in the Outer Rim. Kaine's flagship Reaper was one of the few Imperial Executor-class Star Dreadnoughts in commission.[4] Around the time of the Battle of Endor, one of the two worldcraft in orbit around Coruscant was due to be given to Kaine for his service to the Empire: it was later stolen by Ennix Devian.[11]
            In 4 ABY, Palpatine was killed during a Rebel attack on the second Death Star at Endor, and the Empire was thrown into a state of disarray. News of the Emperor's demise was slow to reach Oversector Outer, but Kaine was eventually informed aboard the Reaper. In previous times, the loss of his hero would have been met with great sorrow by Kaine, but, still bitter about being stationed in the Outer Rim, he merely saw it as an opportunity. Kaine still believed in the ideals of the New Order, but now the opportunity to found a new Empire state, with Kaine at its head, had been presented to him. While other Imperials in the Outer Rim initiated chaotic internecine conflicts, Kaine moved quickly to consolidate his power and form a new Imperial faction. Knowing that many corporations would struggle to keep afloat without Imperial backing, Kaine called together a gathering of corporation heads from the Velcar Free Commerce Zone and Imperial governors aboard the Reaper.[4]
            The "conciliatory meeting" was attended by Imperial Governor Ib Dekeet; Commerce Master Commissioner Gregor Raquoran; Dynamic Automata Corporate Head Elta Besk; Galentro Heavy Works Representative Wyrn Otro; and Kaine himself. Kaine proposed a treaty which would unite the Imperials and corporate interests to create an isolationist political conglomerate that would practice the ideals of the New Order and allow the allied businesses to continue to trade as under the Empire, without interference from the newly-formed New Republic. Kaine was well aware that, should the Velcar Free Commerce Zone fall under New Republic jurisdiction, local syndicates use of slavery and corruption would be quickly stopped, and he used this fact as leverage during the talks, emphasizing the fact several times. The talks were fraught with paranoia and confrontation, and Kaine had to work hard to keep the participants off each other's throats. As it was, none of Kaine's colleagues particularly cared for his political theory, and Otro openly questioning Kaine's ambitions. The Grand Moff refuted claims that he would install himself as Emperor, emphasizing the need for unity and co-operation to ensure the project was a success. Ultimately, the Pentastar Alignment Treaty was signed by all parties, creating the Pentastar Alignment. Kaine dubbed it thus because there were five plenipotentiaries present on his flagship; despite mild objections from Governor Dekeet, all Pentastar vessels and soldiers were adorned with a badge, which Kaine hoped would be a symbol of both unity and fear.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ardus_Kaine</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascArdusKaine</string></dict>
        <key>Cumberlayne Aresko</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.962.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Cumberlayne Aresko, operating number: "LRC-01",[4] was a human male who served as an officer in the Galactic Empire. In 3272 LY, Aresko held the title of Commandant and was stationed in Capital City, on the planet Lothal. Along with Taskmaster Myles Grint, he was charged with training cadets at the local Imperial Academy, along with all other academies throughout the planet.[5] Along with Grint, he once tried to arrest the merchant Yoffar for treason, but a timely distraction by Ezra Bridger saved Yoffar from a potentially sad demise.[6]
            Aresko, along with Grint, attempted to stop the activities of the rebel crew of the Ghost on numerous occasions, employing ineffective tactics that often failed due to Aresko's overconfidence and lack of tactical ability. Due to their multiple failures, they were executed by the Grand Inquisitor, on the orders of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin.[2]
            Born on the Outer Rim planet Lothal,[1] Cumberlayne Aresko was the Commandant of the Academy for Young Imperials on his homeworld. He and his aide Taskmaster Myles Grint were tasked with administrating the Academy and training its recruits. About five years before the Battle of Yavin, Aresko and Grint attended a farewell party that was intended to celebrate the acceptance of Dhara Leonis to the Imperial Academy. Her parents Leo and Tepha Leonis were agricultural scientists who worked for the Empire's Ministry of Agriculture and had recently relocated to Lothal's Capital City. When Dhara's family, including her younger brother Zare Leonis, visited the Academy during that year's Visiting Day, Aresko gave a speech during the welcoming ceremony.[7]
            Following Dhara's mysterious "disappearance" during a training exercise in the Easthills, Commandant Aresko visited the Leonsises' household to inform them that their daughter had ran away from the Imperial Academy. Aresko informed Dhara's parents and brother that she had disappeared without any signs of a struggle and had taken her backpack and supplies. Aresko also asked the Leonises whether Dhara had shown any signs of unhappiness, which was promptly denied by her parents. In response to Dhara's "disappearance", the Commandant issued an alert to all security forces on Lothal to look out for Cadet Dhara and also sent a similar alert to the Imperial customs and identification-processing databases. He promised the Leonises that the Empire would avail every effort to find their daughter.[7]
            Later that year, Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint attended a farewell party to celebrate Dhara's younger brother Zare's successful application to study at the Imperial Academy. During the function, Aresko and Grint monopolized the trays of dainties that the Leonises' family droid Auntie Nags had brought out for the guests. Unknown to Aresko, Zare was planning to infiltrate the Academy in order to find Dhara and to learn about the Empire's inner workings so that he could help the growing Rebellion.[7]
            At some point, Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint participated in the arrest of the corrupt Imperial Security Bureau lieutenant Jenkes, who had murdered his superior Lieutenant Herdringer and ran an illegal gladiatorial event at Monad Outpost. The bounty hunter Bossk and the local street urchin Ezra Bridger had exposed Jenkes' illegal activities to the Imperial authorities on Lothal. Bossk also received a personal guarantee from Aresko and Grint that they would never hear from Jenkes again.[8]
            Aresko and Grint were bullying a merchant in Capital City when he had his comlink stolen by Ezra Bridger, who used it to fool the Imperials into responding to a false alarm. Moments later, he witnessed an explosion caused by the crew of the Ghost in attempt to steal a shipment of E-11 blaster rifles. He stood idly by while Grint and Yogar Lyste attempted to stop the heist. Later that night, Aresko reported to Agent Kallus who had arrived on Lothal to respond to a series of attacks by the Ghost crew. The ISB agent assured the commandant that he was not the first to be attacked by them, which Aresko expressed his relief for, not wishing to be held responsible.[6]
            The following year, Commandant Aresko addressed the cadets who had survived the orientation phase. Besides congratulating the cadets, Aresko announced that transfer cadets would be brought in from Lothal's other regional academies to replace those who had washed out during the orientation period. Aresko then proceeded to announce that the cadets would embark on a series of assessments for the rest of the term. These tests were designed to test their physical prowess, mental acuity, leadership skills, and strategic adaptability. He also informed the cadets that these assessments would be conducted in a purpose-built facility called the Well, which could be remotely configured to simulate a wide variety of obstacle courses and challenges.[9]
            Later that year, Commandant Aresko gave an address to cadets and parents on Visiting Day. As the term progressed, Aresko gave conditional approval for the Imperial cadets to begin field training after the winter break. He believed that the cadets were ready to practice at being soldiers. Prior to the winter break, Aresko and Grint picked the Academy's most promising cadets, Units Aurek and Besh, for a week of assessments. After the cadets entered the Well, Aresko told them that they would leave the Academy in a few short weeks as soldiers and asked them whether they were prepared to serve the Empire as stormtroopers. To encourage competition among the cadets, Aresko rewarded the top three winners with work details at the Imperial Complex in Capital City. He also warned that the losers would have to work for Taskmaster Grint.[9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cumberlayne_Aresko</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCumberlayneAresko</string></dict>

            Aramis was assigned to transport Duchess Kryze and three of her guards form Coruscant after a Senate meeting in which the Senate thinks the Republic should invade Mandalore because of the terrorist group Death Watch kept terrorizing Mandalore in 21 BBY during the Clone Wars. But a terrorist movement called Death Watch sabotaged the controllers and when the transport was high above the ground. Kryze asked what was happening and Aramis said it was the navigation computer. Realizing all hope of transporting Kryze where she wanted to go was lost, Aramis told her he'd try to get near a landing platform. Kryze told him to stop. As soon as he got near the landing platform and ignoring her pleas, he ordered Kryze's guards to jump which is what they did. Sadly, Aramis stayed on the transport and lost control entirely and it crashed into a building, killing Aramis.
            Kryze informed the Republic of the incident. The Republic decided there should be no charges against Aramis's death since they thought it was only an accident. But then she said it happened right after the Senate meeting and that someone must be trying to kill her. But that only made the Republic agree that they must invade Mandalore. But later after seeing a hologram of Deputy Minister Jerec changed the Republic's minds and the invasion never happened.
            Aramis had light brown eyebrows, blue eyes, and light skin. He was willing to die for Duchess Satine Kryze.[2]

        <key>Sirro Argonne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.967.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sirro Argonne was a human male scientist who served in the Galactic Republic's Ministry of Science before becoming an operations specialist in the Galactic Empire's Tarkin Initiative and being assigned to the planet Eadu. He was executed by death troopers under the command of Director Orson Krennic after a message was sent to the rebellious Partisans by Argonne's colleague Galen Erso.
            Sirro Argonne was a scientist who served as a member of the Galactic Republic's Ministry of Science during the final decades of the Republic's rule. After the Republic was replaced by the Galactic Empire, he became a part of the Tarkin Initiative which was responsible for the creation of the Death Star superweapon. Argonne was assigned as operations specialist to a group of five other scientists led by Galen Erso, whom were tasked with finding out how to fuse the kyber crystals used by the Death Star's superlaser into larger forms and how to create and redirect a controlled chain reaction of the crystals.[1]
            The group were based in a secret laboratory on the planet Eadu, where Argonne was responsible for administering the facility and seeing to the personal and professional needs of the other scientists based there. The team remained in seclusion on the planet for nearly twenty years, but by 0 BBY[1] they had successfully completed their given tasks, allowing the Death Star to be equipped with a functional weapon. After the weapon was complete, Erso secretly sent a message to the rebellious Partisans' leader Saw Gerrera on the moon Jedha, asking him to bring information of a structural weakness he had built into the Death Star to the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[2]
            Once Director Orson Krennic of the Empire's Advanced Weapons Research division became aware that information had escaped from the laboratory, he personally traveled to Eadu to find the source of the betrayal. Upon his arrival at the laboratory he had Erso gather his team on the facility's landing pad where he demanded to know who had sent the message. When neither Argonne or his colleagues stepped forward, Krennic declared that he would assume it had been a group effort and prepared to have his personal cohort of death troopers execute them. Unable to see his innocent colleagues slaughtered for his crime, Erso stepped forward and admitted his guilt, but despite this, Krennic still ordered his men to fire, killing Argonne and the others where they stood. Erso was killed shortly after when the Alliance's Blue Squadron bombed the laboratory, forcing Krennic to flee.[2]
            Arogonne was a human male scientific genius[1] with fair skin and hair that had turned gray by the time of his death in 0 BBY.[2]
            While on Eadu Argonne wore antiseptic coveralls to prevent lab contamination and carried a pair of code cylinders that granted him access to the high security laboratories. Argonne's coveralls were marked with the insignia of both the Empire and the Tarkin Initiative and bore blue sections across the neck and shoulders that changed color as a warning when revealed to high levels of radiation. The outfit's boots were grounded to prevent potentially dangerous static discharges occuring in the labs.[1]
            Sirro Argonne first appeared in the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released in North America on December 15, 2016.[2] He was not named in the film, but received identification in Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide, a reference book written by Pablo Hidalgo and released the day after the film.[1] Arogonne was portrayed by Richard Franklin in the film, but was credited as "Engineer" in the end credits.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sirro_Argonne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSirroArgonne</string></dict>

An Imperial general, Bast was stationed on the first Death Star, the Galactic Empire's planet-destroying superweapon, where he served as the chief personal aide to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and the subordinate to High General Cassio Tagge. In 0 BBY, Bast was present for a meeting in the battlestation's conference room, discussing the lost Death Star plans, which had been stolen by the Rebel Alliance. After the Battle of Yavin began, Bast received information that the Rebels had found a small vulnerable thermal exhaust port in the Death Star's superstructure. Since the exhaust port was a danger to the battlestation, Bast wanted Tarkin to evacuate the Death Star, although the Grand Moff believed that the Imperial forces would thwart the Rebels' attack. However, after the Rebel Luke Skywalker successfully launched a proton torpedo into the Death Star's thermal exhaust port, the Death Star exploded, killing Bast and everyone else on board.
            Moradmin Bast, a Human male, hailed from the planet Dura-Kahn. At a young age, Bast learned patience and cunning abilities by hunting big-game on his homeworld.[6] Bast also saw the Rebel Alliance as a threat while growing up and believed that it should not be underestimated.[1]
            At some point, Bast enlisted in the Imperial Army and eventually attained the rank of general. Prior to the start of the Galactic Civil War,[5] which began in 2 BBY,[2] the general was assigned to serve as the subordinate to High General Cassio Tagge, the head of Army Operations aboard the first Death Star battlestation.[5] In this capacity, Bast frequently acted as the chief personal aide to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin,[3] the battlestation's lead commander.[7] Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, the head of Navy Operations aboard the Death Star, feared Bast and Tagge, due to their loyalty and respect toward Tarkin.[5]
            Shortly before the destruction of Alderaan[4] in 0 BBY,[2] Bast attended a staff conference on the battlestation. The Death Star's command staff—which included Tarkin, Tagge, and Motti—discussed the Rebel Alliance and its possession of the Death Star's technical schematics,[4] which had been stolen by the Rebels during the Battle of Toprawa.[8] Believing that the Death Star was "the ultimate power in the universe," Motti wanted to use the station to threaten the Rebels, although the Dark Lord Darth Vader reassured Motti that the Death Star's destructive capability was insignificant next to the power of the Force. Throughout the conference, Bast sat in silence and witnessed Motti's near death as Vader Force choked him for his lack of faith in the Force.[4]
            Following the rescue of Alderaanian Princess Leia Organa aboard the Death Star, Tarkin was able to locate the Rebels' secret headquarters after having a homing beacon attached to the princess's getaway freighter. Tracking the starship to the Yavin system, the Death Star approached its target—Yavin 4, home of the Rebel base. Before the Death Star could fire on Yavin 4, the station had to orbit around the planet Yavin Prime. The battlestation's presence triggered the Battle of Yavin as the Rebels attempted to exploit a weakness in the battlestation's superstructure by launching proton torpedoes into a small thermal exhaust port that led directly to the Death Star's main reactor.[4]
            However, the Rebels were not the only ones to discover this flaw. As the battle raged, military analysts informed Bast that the vulnerability of the thermal exhaust port in the face of the Rebel starfighter attack posed a real danger to everyone aboard the battlestation. Wary of the Rebels' cunning,[1] Bast immediately brought this information to Tarkin in the Death Star's overbridge and inquired whether the Grand Moff wished to have his ship ready for evacuation, but Tarkin contemptuously brushed his recommendations aside. Despite his reservations, Bast remained with his superior officer and watched as the battlestation approached Yavin 4.[4]
            Once the Death Star cleared the planet, Tarkin, without hesitation, ordered a nearby engineer to fire the superlaser on Yavin 4 to end the Rebel Alliance.[4] However, Tenn Graneet, the master chief petty officer responsible for firing the superlaser, momentarily hesitated.[5] Graneet's delay allowed Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker to successfully fire a pair of proton torpedoes into the thermal exhaust port before the superlaser was fired.[4] Bast, as well as everyone stationed on the Death Star, was killed when the massive battlestation exploded near Yavin 4.[3]
            Moradmin Bast had no personal aspirations beyond serving the Empire and was loyal to Tarkin and Tagge aboard the Death Star.[5] Some officers believed that Vader was a subordinate to Tarkin; however, Bast respected the Dark Lord, since he witnessed how Vader dealt with foolish officers.[9] A confident man who rarely underestimated his enemies,[3] Bast often praised the work that Tarkin had done on the Death Star.[5] During the meeting aboard the Death Star prior to the Battle of Yavin, Bast remained quiet throughout. As Tarkin's chief personal aide, Bast became concerned for Tarkin's well being during the ensuing battle and delivered the Grand Moff information regarding the Rebel attack on the battlestation, including an offer to evacuate. However, Tarkin dismissed Bast's report as an overestimation of the Rebels' chances at victory, which ultimately cost the Grand Moff his life, as the Death Star was soon obliterated.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Moradmin_Bast/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMoradminBast</string></dict>
        <key>Antes Belladar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.970.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Antes Belladar was the Human male governor of the agricultural planet Reytha during the reign of the Galactic Empire. In 0 ABY, during the Galactic Civil War, Reytha was taken over by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, which Belladar was unable to prevent. Eventually, he received assistance from the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who was able to eliminate the Rebels from several of Reytha's major cities. After Belladar discovered a Rebel presence in the Montrosa Islands, Vader led his army there. When he arrived at the islands, Vader executed Belladar for failing to prevent the Alliance takeover, and then eliminated the remaining Rebels from the planet.
            Antes Belladar was a Human male who served the Galactic Empire and rose to the position of governor of the agricultural planet Reytha several years before 0 ABY. In that year, during the Galactic Civil War, a major conflict between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Reytha was taken over by the Alliance, and Belladar was unable to prevent it from doing so. To counter the Rebel threat, the Governor was forced to request help from the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, who had already discovered the Rebels' plan to take Reytha when he had chased them off their base on the moon Yavin 4. Upon receiving the information, Vader left for Reytha immediately, knowing that the loss of its food supplies could strongly damage the Empire.[1]
            Upon Vader's arrival, Belladar thanked him for responding so quickly to his call, and then reported that the Alliance was still preparing to attack the planet. However, a probe droid scan showed that the Rebels had already taken over Reytha. Vader planned to take the capital city, Reytha Minor, but instead led his army to attack and retake the smaller cities of Teks and Breeda for the Empire. After Vader did so, Belladar was surprised that he was able to defeat the Rebels in those cities. As soon as it had gained enough soldiers, the Empire launched its assault on Reytha Minor and destroyed the Rebels' command center. Belladar then received a report from a Reythan soldier that the Alliance had set up multiple bases in the planet's Montrosa Islands. Belladar relayed this to Vader, who then departed for the islands.[1]
            Once Vader's army arrived at the islands, Belladar told him of the structure the Rebels had set up in their bases. Vader, however, questioned the Governor on how the Rebels had been allowed to infiltrate Reytha, but Belladar was not sure what Vader was asking. Deciding that the Governor had failed the Empire for the last time, Vader used the Force to strangle Belladar, killing him. Vader then destroyed the Rebel bases in the Montrosa Islands and continued his search for the Alliance Fleet.[1]
            Antes Belladar was able to achieve the position of governor of Reytha under the Empire, but several years on the relatively peaceful planet led many to believe that he had grown soft, and the Empire even considered the possibility that Belladar was a Rebel sympathizer. Emperor's Hand Mara Jade saw the Governor as being weak in his abilities. When Darth Vader arrived on Reytha, Belladar gave outdated information to him, reporting that the Rebel Alliance was only preparing to attack when, in fact, it had already completed its takeover of the planet. Belladar also preferred a task that was his responsibility be passed to someone else to save him the trouble of completing it himself. Belladar was fair-skinned, and, during the Rebel takeover of Reytha, he wore a visor attached to a helmet that hid most of his face.[1]
            Antes Belladar has only appeared in the 2001 PC video game Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and in its 2002 expansion, Clone Campaigns, in which he was voiced by James Horan.[1][2] Prior to the game's release, Belladar was mentioned in its strategy guide.[3] Belladar appeared first in the second level of the Imperial campaign, titled "Breaking Bread," and he was also in the next level "Fire, Earth, Water and Air." In the levels Belladar does not actually appear, but his voice is heard talking to the player, and he is shown in the game's level editor, in which he fights other units placed by the player with a blaster. Belladar's first name is also only given in the level editor; in the levels his character is always just called "Reytha Governor," with his last name being given in dialogue with Darth Vader.[1]
            In Galactic Battlegrounds, an inconsistency occurs involving Belladar. At the end of the first level of the Imperial campaign, the Empire finds intelligence on Yavin 4 that leads them to arrive at Reytha; however, at the start of the next level Belladar thanks Vader for responding to his call for help, and Vader asks why he has been summoned. This article assumes that the Empire found the intelligence on Yavin 4 and left for Reytha, and that Belladar requested Vader's assistance at the same time.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Antes_Belladar</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAntesBelladar</string></dict>
        <key>Barokki</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.971.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Barokki was a human male colonel that served in the Galactic Empire early during its reign.
            During the early rule of the Galactic Empire,[2] Barokki[1] served as an Imperial colonel with his own division and was part of the Imperial Officer Corps. Eventually, Barokki personally presented a report to Emperor Sheev Palpatine on the performance of his division. Dissatisfied with his division's performance, Darth Vader, Palpatine's enforcer, began to Force choke Barokki. After some time, Palpatine ordered Vader to release him, thanked Barokki for the report, and hoped that his division would demonstrate better performance in the following weeks.[2]
            Eventually, furious of Vader's quick rise to power and authority, Barokki and an accomplice, a fellow Imperial officer, decided to assassinate the Sith Lord.[1] In the first attempt, a mercenary contract from Emperor Palpatine's office was sent to Chanath Cha, Ramat Cha, and Bhada Cha to kill Vader, and a Jedi sighting was faked at a bar on Cabarria. Vader was able to defeat the bounty hunters and discover that the contract originated from Palpatine's office.[3]
            A second attempt was attempted on Vader's return to Coruscant in his personal starship. During Vader's arrival, he became aware of individuals with Level 1A1 and had access to the highest levels of the Imperial Executive Building, including Palpatine's office. The starship was then incorrectly identified as being part of a Separatist splinter cell and subsequently had its transmissions jammed. Unable to transmit the clearance codes, Vader's ship was targeted by a Coruscant Security Force missile platform. Vader's ship crashed on the surface of Coruscant but he, along with Ninth Sister, survived. Believing that it was Palpatine himself testing Vader's abilities, he confronted his Sith Master at the former Jedi Temple where he learned that it was not his master who was behind the attacks.[1]
            As Vader meditated to uncover the truth, Barokki met undercover with his fellow conspirator in The Room of Masks located in the Uscru District on Coruscant. There, Barokki was told by his accomplice that Vader had survived both attempts and that Vader was recently seen with Emperor Palpatine with no signs of abnormality. Barokki's accomplice believed that either Vader was not smart enough to find the trace to the Emperor's office, or they had an accommodation. Barokki was baffled by the relationship between Palpatine and Vader. After Barokki's co-conspirator complained about Vader's unexpected rise to power with no restrictions and wondered if he was a servant or bodyguard, Barokki responded that he believed it was something more, and informed his colleague that Palpatine had made Vader the leader of the Inquisitorius program. Barokki continued, stating that it didn't matter and that they couldn't stop their attempts to eliminate Vader, believing that clarification and better management would come after Vader was dealt with.[1]
            Although Barokki's counterpart doubted that they could continue, Barokki persisted, and stated that Vader was either good, or lucky, or both, and that he would eventually die if they continued, as everything died. During Barokki's conversation with the other officer, Vader had a vision of the time he had Force chocked Barokki and understood that he was part of the assassination attempts. After Vader approached Palpatine with what he had learned, Palpatine called on the elite officers of the Imperial Officer Corps to an auditorium, including Barokki and his counterpart.[1]
            There, Palpatine stated that the officers would form the core of the Empire's efforts to bring peace to the galaxy, and understood that there were several elements of hierarchy that may confuse them, and that it was time to eliminate such thoughts. He then introduced Vader, stating that he was his voice, and that any command from Vader was a command of himself. Vader then called upon Corin Ferro, Zorta Bingan, Joon Strephi, Tomas Azoras, and Barokki, who began to grow nervous, to step forward. Vader then announced that he had been the target of two assassination attempts by members of the Imperial Officer Corps, and although he did not know the exact identities of his attackers, he had his suspicions. Vader continued, stating that it did not matter as he would always survive, and that every time he would survive. Vader then mentioned that the five of the officers, including Barokki, chosen at random would not, and Force choked them all to death. As Vader began to leave, Barokki's co-conspirator watched on.[1]
            Barokki was a human male with red hair and light skin. Jealous of Darth Vader's unexpected rise to power in the Imperial hierarchy, Barokki took part in assassination attempts to eliminate Vader. Despite both attempts failing, Barokki believed that Vader would eventually die, as all things died, if they continued their plot against him. He did not have a regard on how Vader served Emperor Palpatine, and believed that everything would be clearer once Vader had been eliminated.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Barokki</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBarokki</string></dict>
        <key>Kell Bircher</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.972.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kell Bircher was a male Human who was a Rebel spy and nephew of the Rebel leader, Mon Mothma. Following the Battle of Yavin, he used the skills of a Bothan slicer to enter his identity in the Imperial database as a colonel. He was able to parlay his station to become the commander of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, Devastator, taking control of the ship from its previous commander, Darth Vader. As commander of the Devastator, he was involved in hunting down the Rebel fleet, personally piloting a TIE interceptor to engage Rebel forces. Bircher was eventually able to track the location of the Rebel fleet after following the Rebel pilot, Prithi, who had skirted protocols of making several different hyperspace jumps before returning to base. In the ensuing attack, Bircher was forced to reveal his double agent status, shutting down his TIE interceptor squadron, and disabling Devastator. The Imperial Star Destroyer was forced to abandon the attack while Bircher turned himself over to Mothma. Although the other Rebels were suspicious of him, Mothma vouched for his character, and he returned to the Chandrila system to continue aiding the Alliance.
            Kell Bircher was a Human male from Chandrila and the nephew of the Rebel leader, Mon Mothma. He was a student of political history and was a member of the Chandrilan Special Forces. He eventually became a devoted member of the Rebellion and was chosen for a secret mission for the Rebellion. With the aid of a Bothan slicer, Bircher's name was inserted into the civilian and military databases of the Galactic Empire. He was given the rank of colonel and was able to smuggle himself into Imperial ranks shortly before the Battle of Yavin.[1]
            Two months after the Battle of Yavin, Bircher was ordered by Emperor Palpatine to take over command of Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, the Devastator.[2] He later briefed a group of TIE interceptor pilots, the best-of-the best who were going to fly advanced models. Bircher wore a red flight suit.[3] He personally led two squadrons of those pilots in an ambush of Gray Flight. When the Rebel X-wings launched proton torpedoes and destroyed eleven interceptors, he did not authorize a withdrawal. Instead, he called for evasion pattern Delta Delta Victor. The Rebels were able to escape from the ambush.[4]
            When the Devastator chased the Rebels to their next ambush point, Bircher led the remaining Interceptors to face Gray Flight. The Rebels launched more torpedoes, and Bircher confirmed that they were going to miss the Star Destroyer. However, the Rebels were actually targeting a fusion generator, which blew up. Bircher, at the last moment, realized that the Rebels were retreating and ordered his own forces to fall back. He then activated his hyperdrive to escape to rendezvous coordinates Beta One. The Devastator escaped, although their Interdictor was heavily damaged. Later, aboard the Devastator, Bircher ordered updates on damage reports.[5]
            Shortly afterward, he was aboard the Devastator at a no-fly zone with an Imperial fleet. He ordered a shuttle piloted by the Rebels Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles to stand down and prepare to be boarded. He ordered a search, and then greeted Lieutenant Birra Seah as she arrived on the bridge.[6] Bircher followed the Alliance Fleet and when they arrived at the coordinates, ordered all of his TIE fighters to launch. He planned on joining them himself.[7] As the Devastator opened fire on the fleet, Bircher led his group into range. At two kilometers out, he ordered them to open fire. During the battle, he transmitted external control of the Imperial fighters over to Home One and jammed tactical communications. He then crashed aboard Hangar Five on the cruiser and met his aunt, Mon Mothma.[8]
            Bircher revealed himself as a Rebel spy and was forced to explain his actions to members of Gray Flight, claiming that he had always had a backup plan to shut down weapons control of his forces if he believed that they might kill any Rebel pilots. Although Wedge Antilles offered Bircher a position in the newly formed Rogue Squadron from the remains of Gray Flight, he was forced to decline as he had business back in the Chandrila system. As he departed, he complimented Gray Flight's leader, Leia Organa, claiming that she was a damn fine pilot.[1]
            In response to Bircher's infiltration, Darth Vader embarked on a secret mission to eliminate the hackers who had placed him into the system, and to purge those who had fallen into his deception.[9] Vader's search eventually brought him to Chandrila, but Bircher was not at the Mothma home at the time when Vader destroyed it.[10]
            Emperor Palpatine considered him a young and capable officer. When he arrived aboard the Devastator, he stated he had already taken precautions to ensure that he was prepared for anything.[2]
            He disregarded the lives of his men, speaking of how it was their moment of triumph.[4] He was able to recognize a trap when the Rebel starfighters began retreating.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kell_Bircher</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKellBircher</string></dict>
        <key>Bail Organa</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.973.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bail Organa was a human male Alderaanian politician, an influential voice for peace in the Galactic Senate during the last days of the Galactic Republic, and a founding member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Organa, the senator of Alderaan, was an outspoken member of the Senate's Loyalist Committee that pushed to maintain the ideals of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He became an architect of the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire and believed that a full-scale Galactic Civil War was inevitable if the Empire was to be toppled and replaced by a New Republic.
            During the Clone Wars, Organa often worked closely with Senators Padmé Amidala of Naboo and Mon Mothma of Chandrila in an attempt to de-escalate the war with the Confederacy of Independent Systems and bring about a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to the years-long conflict. He was an opponent of the Republic military enhancement bill that increased the production of clone troopers for the Grand Army of the Republic, as well as the architect of the Alderaan Refugee Conference to deal with the refugees displaced by the war with the Separatist Alliance. At times he became caught in the action of the war, including when his relief effort on Christophsis fell under Separatist siege shortly before the Battle of Christophsis. He also ensured that relief supplies could be delivered to the citizens of Ryloth during the Separatist occupation of the planet.
            After the transformation of the Republic into the Empire, Organa continued to serve in the Imperial Senate but quietly began organizing a rebel movement to combat the Empire. He and his wife, Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan, secretly adopted Leia Organa, who came into their care after her mother, Senator Amidala, died and her husband, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, fell to the dark side of the Force. Princess Leia followed in her father's footsteps and succeeded him in the Senate while quietly supporting the Rebel Alliance. Organa tasked her with finding Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, his old friend and ally, in exile on Tatooine and bringing him into the fight. Bail then returned home to Alderaan to inform his people that war was coming, a warning that would come too late. Shortly thereafter, Organa and the queen were killed when the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon, destroyed Alderaan. They were remembered fondly by the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic as revolutionaries who fought to restore peace and freedom in the galaxy.
            Bail Organa was a politician and a member of the royal family of Alderaan.[2] At some point following the Invasion of Naboo, he came to represent his home planet in the Senate of the Galactic Republic, succeeding Bail Antilles, his relative by marriage.[10] Organa was also the Viceroy of his homeworld and the husband of Breha Organa, Queen of Alderaan.[11]
            As soon as he entered the intergalactic political arena, he established strong ties with like-minded senators, including Padmé Amidala of Naboo and Mon Mothma of Chandrila. He also became close friends with Finis Valorum, former Supreme Chancellor of the Republic.[10] Due to his honesty and his commitment to justice, Organa gained the respect of his senatorial peers and came to be esteemed as a politician.[2] In spite of Organa's best efforts, the galactic government grew increasingly plagued by corruption, ultimately leading malcontents to take extreme action: led by the former Jedi Count Dooku, a loose affiliation of outlying star systems formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems and declared itself seceded from the Galactic Republic.[12] With the rise of further separatism following the rise of the Confederacy, Organa joined the Senate's Loyalist Committee, the members of which supported the Republic and its leader, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. In the framework of the committee, Organa came to work closely with Padmé Amidala.[2]
            In time, the Separatist Crisis escalated into the full-scale conflict known as the Clone Wars. Organa, opposed to the war but cognizant of its inevitability, became especially active in his devotion to relief missions and other humanitarian operations. In this context, he often worked with members of the Jedi Order, for whom he came to develop a deep respect.[2]
            Shortly before the Battle of Christophsis, Organa led a relief force to the planet to aid its besieged people and beleaguered Republic troops. In this context, he and his relief effort became trapped on Christophsis' surface by General Whorm Loathsom's forces[13] and a Separatist blockade led by the infamous Admiral Trench.[14] When Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi led an assault against Trench's fleet in an attempt to break through and aid Organa, the Admiral responded with a withering attack, forcing the Jedi to retreat behind a nearby moon. Trench staged several devastating attack runs against Organa's on-planet camp at the Minister of Sustenance's compound in Chaleydonia[13] and draw Skywalker and Kenobi out from behind the moon, but the Harch admiral's blockade were finally broken by a stealth ship flown by Skywalker and Admiral Yularen. Organa then thanked Skywalker for delivering the supplies[14] and then watched as Loathsom's forces retreated.[13]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bail_Organa</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBailOrgana</string></dict>
        <key>Bedoch</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.974.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bedoch was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order during the Cold War with the Sith Empire. A member of a sect of the Order known as the Corellian Jedi, Bedoch was renowned for both his patriotism as well as his paranoia. He consistently feared the end of days, and came to see the Battle of Corellia as just such an event, barricading himself in the Republic Foundation Museum, where he perished.
            A Force-sensitive Corellian, Bedoch was trained in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order; achieving the rank of Jedi Master by the time of the time of the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Like many Jedi born on Corellia, Bedoch possessed a deep-rooted patriotism for his homeworld and was a devoted member of the sect of Corellian Jedi which chose to take on missions relating to the planet and her people. Renowned throughout the Order and the ranks of the "Green" Jedi of Corellia, Bedoch was on his homeworld when the Empire invaded. Fighting valiantly, Bedoch saw the Empire's arrival and the ensuing occupation as a sign of the end of days for Corellia. Refusing to surrender or to retreat to the Jedi Enclave with his fellows, Bedoch fled to the Republic Foundation Museum to defend Corellia's history.[1]
            Proclaiming the Imperials to be an infection needing to be removed, he defiantly refused to leave the Museum when a strike team was sent in after him. Defying the Empire and without any support from the Jedi at the Enclave, Bedoch was forced to fight alone in the Museum's halls. Valiantly attacking the strike team with his lightsaber, Bedoch was swiftly outnumbered and killed. When the Imperial team searched the Jedi's body they discovered Bedoch's personal access codes to the Jedi Enclave, thus allowing them to access it without setting off the security klaxons.[1]
            Like most Jedi, Bedoch was taught the way of lightsaber combat, and became proficient in the skill once he attained the rank of Master. During the Cold War, Bedoch wielded a double-bladed lightsaber which emitted emerald blades.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bedoch</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBedoch</string></dict>
        <key>Daakman Barrek</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.975.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Daakman Barrek was a male Human from the planet Mrlsst, who lived during the last years of the Galactic Republic. At an early age, Barrek's mother discovered that he was Force-sensitive and willingly gave Daakman over to the Jedi Order. Barrek became a powerful member of the Order, quickly ascending to the rank of Master after training his first Padawan, and took a second apprentice named Sha'a Gi. In 22 BBY, Barrek and Sha'a Gi were operating in the Outer Rim when they received word that war had broken out between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems on Geonosis, and that Barrek's first apprentice had died in the fighting.
            Saddened by this news, Barrek accepted the rank of Jedi General in the Republic's clone army. Four months after the start of the war, Barrek and Gi uncovered intelligence that the Separatists had built a battle droid factory on Hypori, and the two were tasked with leading an elite task force in destroying the factory. However, their battle plan went horribly wrong once the task force's transport ships exited hyperspace over Hypori, hitting an orbital mine grid, causing them to crash land on the planet. The Separatists' droid army then began to assault the crashed Republic ships, killing what was left of Barrek's clone forces, leaving Daakman and the task force's Jedi trapped in the wreckage. Stranded behind enemy lines, Barrek tried to contact General Obi-Wan Kenobi on Muunilinst, but was attacked by the battle droids' leader, General Grievous. Barrek managed to reach Kenobi and inform his fellow Jedi on his task force's situation and call for an extraction, but Grievous—a highly advanced cyborg trained in lightsaber combat—cut down the Jedi Master before help could arrive.
            Daakman Barrek was a male Human born to highly educated professors on the academy planet of Mrlsst. Barrek's mother—a famed geneticist—soon discovered her son's high midi-chlorian count through a blood screening test she had done herself. Realizing that Barrek was Force-sensitive, she contacted the High Council of the Jedi Order, hoping her son would find greatness serving the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Knight. Barrek was taken into the Order and trained as a Jedi, quickly showing that he was adept in the ways of the Force. Barrek eventually took a Padawan learner, achieving the rank of Jedi Master in his mid-thirties after successfully training his apprentice to Knighthood.[1]
            Master Barrek later discovered Sha'a Gi, a young Force-sensitive Human from the planet Ord Biniir, and took Gi back to Jedi Temple on Coruscant to become his new apprentice. Although young Gi was often cowardly and possessed self-doubt while alone, Barrek strengthened his new Padawan's confidence when he was close by, and the two worked well together.[3]
            Barrek and Gi were investigating pirate activity in the Outer Rim when the pair received word that the Clone Wars had begun between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems—a group of planets and corporations trying to secede from the Republic—on Geonosis. Barrek was also told that his first apprentice had been sent to Geonosis and had died in the fighting. Saddened by the death of his former Padawan, Barrek committed himself fully to the war effort, accepting the position of Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic, leading the Army's clone troopers into battle against the Separatist Droid Army.[1]
            Four months into the war,[4] Barrek and Gi were again investigating pirate activity in the Outer Rim[3] when they discovered intelligence on a secret battle droid foundry on the industrial world of Hypori. After alerting the Jedi Council, the two were given command of a task force, made up of several elite Jedi—including Council members Ki-Adi-Mundi and Shaak Ti—and clone trooper units, and ordered to destroy the droid factory on Hypori.[1]
            However, Barrek's mission quickly collapsed into disaster once the Republic task force arrived at Hypori. As soon as Barrek's forces exited hyperspace over Hypori, their Acclamator-class transports hit an orbital mine grid, causing their ships to crash land on the Separatist planet, deep behind enemy lines. While Barrek, Gi, and the other Jedi managed to survive the crash, most of the task force's clone troopers were killed in the landing, and Confederate factory deployed thousands of B2 super battle droids to assault the Republic's landing site.[1] Led by General Grievous—an advanced cyborg trained in lightsaber combat—[5]the Separatist droid forces killed what was left of Barrek's clone troopers, and trapped the Jedi in the wreckage of their ships.[1]
            Realizing the Jedi were no match for Grievous and his battle droids, Barrek attempted to contact General Obi-Wan Kenobi, currently stationed on Muunilinst, via hologram. However, as Barrek reached Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker, Grievous attacked the Jedi Master and engaged Barrek in a lightsaber duel. Barrek managed to inform Kenobi of his task force's situation and call for an extraction while fending off Grievous's attack, but the cyborg proved too powerful for Master Barrek, striking down the Jedi Master.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Daakman_Barrek</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDaakmanBarrek</string></dict>

        <key>Darth Bane</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.980.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Bane, born under the name of Dessel, was the Sith'ari and the Dark Lord of the Sith responsible for creating the Rule of Two. Born in 1026 BBY, he was raised as a poor miner on the Outer Rim planet Apatros. After killing a Galactic Republic ensign in a fight in 1003 BBY, Dessel was in danger of being arrested and imprisoned by the Republic. With the help of his friend Groshik, he escaped off-world to join the Sith Brotherhood of Darkness. Initially serving as a foot soldier in the Gloom Walkers unit, he was recognized as a Force-sensitive, and taken to the Sith Academy on Korriban. Bane, as he had been christened, quickly became one of the best students at the Academy before he lost his faith in the dark side of the Force. Though Bane was able to regain his confidence in the dark side, he lost his trust in the Brotherhood of Darkness, believing it to be a flawed organization whose leader, Skere Kaan, was a coward and a fool. Deserting the order, he went to the planet Lehon and studied the holocron of Darth Revan, and, armed with new knowledge, helped destroy the Brotherhood, allowing him to create his own Sith Order. He then instituted a Rule of Two, which stated that there could be only two Sith to avoid the infighting that had plagued the Sith for millennia. He also took both the title of Darth and an apprentice named Darth Zannah.
            In 990 BBY, ten years after the destruction of the Brotherhood, Bane sought to learn how to create a holocron, through which he would pass down his knowledge to future Sith Lords. The Sith journeyed to the Deep Core world of Tython to locate the Sith holocron of the ancient Dark Lord Belia Darzu. However, while Bane was on Tython, the Jedi Order learned of his existence, and sent a group of Jedi to kill him and his apprentice. Once the Jedi arrived, they confronted the two Sith in Darzu's fortress. Though outnumbered, the Sith were able to defeat the Jedi; however, Bane was grievously injured. Zannah took him to Ambria, where she convinced the healer Caleb to help them. Caleb notified the Jedi Council, only to have Zannah use her powers to drive Caleb's assistant Darovit insane. Zannah killed Caleb, then hid herself and Bane. When the Jedi arrived, they killed Darovit, believing him to be the Sith Lord. Thus, the Sith were believed destroyed.
            A decade later, Bane began to worry that his apprentice was too weak to overthrow him and assume the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith, as was necessary under the Rule of Two. He began to research the secrets to prolonging his life by transferring his essence to another body, and traveled to Prakith, where he claimed the holocron of the ancient Darth Andeddu. After returning from Prakith, Bane was ambushed by a team of assassins hired by Caleb's daughter, Serra, and was captured. Taken to Doan, Bane was imprisoned and interrogated, only to covertly gain his freedom soon afterward. Encountering Zannah on Doan, Bane dueled his apprentice, who sought to become the new Dark Lord. The fight ended in a draw, with Bane escaping and heading to Ambria with Darth Cognus, an Iktotchi assassin skilled in use of the dark side whom Bane planned to take as his apprentice if Zannah proved herself weak and unworthy. There, Bane and Zannah engaged in a fateful duel that resulted in the death of the Sith'ari and Zannah claiming the title of Dark Lord. Nearly a millennium later, Bane's Sith Order defeated the Jedi Order and overthrew the Republic.
            The Human male who would become Darth Bane was born as Dessel on the Outer Rim planet Apatros in 1026 BBY to an abusive miner named Hurst. Des, as he was nicknamed, was often bullied by his father and the other miners. Hurst blamed his son for the death of his wife, who had perished during childbirth. Hurst also took to blaming Dessel for his own miserable life on Apatros, and considered his son to be the bane of his existence—so much so that he took to calling him "bane" frequently. In 1010 BBY, at the age of sixteen, Dessel began to work in the cortosis mines of Apatros under the direction of the Outer Rim Oreworks Company. He learned to fend for himself, ignoring the threats and insults hurled at him by his father and the other miners, and grew into a muscular young man as he worked deep in the cortosis mines. One of Dessel's few friends was Groshik, the Neimoidian owner of the local cantina. Unknown to anyone, Dessel was Force-sensitive, and he occasionally felt the call of the Force's dark side.[1]
            One day, when Dessel was eighteen, a drunk Hurst berated him until Dessel stood up to his father and challenged him to a fight. Irate, Hurst beat him until his ribs cracked, although Dessel withstood the pain without sound. That night, Dessel, filled with hate, envisioned his father dying by picturing a giant hand squeezing his heart. The next morning, Hurst was dead. Unknown to Dessel, he had used the Force to kill his father. After Hurst's death, his friends tried to continue with their harassment of Dessel, but the young miner now had the confidence to stand up for himself, and proceeded to best many of them in fights until they learned to leave him alone. On the fifth anniversary of Hurst's death, a man named Gerd—who had been friends with Hurst—decided that he would put Dessel in his place. In a drunken stupor, Gerd attacked Dessel and attempted to gouge out one of his eyes. With a premonition granted by the dark side of the Force, Dessel severed Gerd's thumb with his teeth.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Bane/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthBane</string></dict>
        <key>Brandei</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.981.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brandei was a Human male who served the Imperial Navy of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.
            Brandei was born on Mantooine in 45 BBY during the last decades of the Galactic Republic. As a cadet from an Outer Rim Territories world, he had to struggle to overcome discrimination; even exemplary work gained him only marginal notice from his professors and superiors. Nonetheless, his academy training—perhaps on Raithal[source?]—imbued him with a definite air of purpose and confidence, and he made his mark in the Imperial military in spite of this initial prejudice.
            Brandei spent much of his career aboard the Star Destroyer Judicator, assigned to the area of the Core Worlds embracing Garos IV. In 6 BBY, he held the rank of Senior Lieutenant, and it was at his suggestion that his old friend Tork Winger, an administrator on Garos IV, adopted a Rebel orphan, the girl later known as Alex Winger.
            By 3 ABY, Brandei had been transferred aboard the Star Dreadnought Executor, where he performed bridge duty as a Technical Services Officer with the Fleet Support Branch, holding the title of commander and the overall responsibility for the up-keep, maintenance, and combat readiness of the ship's twelve TIE squadrons. Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, however, he received notice of a transfer back the Judicator, aboard which he apparently served at the Battle of Endor. By 6 ABY, New Republic Intelligence believed that he had received a further promotion soon after Endor.
            Brandei's assignment as captain of the Judicator allowed him to renew his acquaintance with the Wingers, but beginning around three years after Endor, he made several further visits to Garos IV with a more driven mission: overseeing the shipment of a Garosian ore for use in Imperial cloaking device projects. At around this time, he also made an intense study of what he still regarded as the Rebellion, attempting to understand his enemies in order to defeat them. He came to believe that while Rebels would fight fiercely if they had no other option, they were ultimately driven by an ill-thought-out compassion, often prepared to abandon their mission and their cause to save their immediate friends. Ultimately, he thought, they wanted an easy life, rather than to fight for the greater good, and that understanding this was the key to defeating them.
            During Grand Admiral Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic in 9 ABY, Brandei remained commanding officer of the Judicator and was part of Thrawn's personal armada. He led a successful assault on the planet Nkllon in the Athega system, with the objective of capturing mole miners from Lando Calrissian's Nomad City, though the operation caused extensive damage to the Judicator that required lengthy repair work. He was also present at the New Republic's discovery of the Katana fleet. There, he personally witnessed the destruction of the Star Destroyer Peremptory at the 'hands' of a slave-rigged Dreadnaught-class cruiser when it collided with the Star Destroyer, causing Brandei much anger for which he would later be reprimanded by Thrawn.
            Following the fragmentation of the Empire that resulted from the final death of Palpatine, Captain Brandei settled his forces on Janara III and the Judicator patrolled the sector. In 12 ABY, the Star Destroyer intercepted Blue Squadron's X-wing starfighters during a routine mission. Lieutenant Alexandra Winger was captured during the skirmish and conduced to Janara III. The New Republic eventually sent forces to rescue her, forcing Brandei to abandon the planet.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brandei</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBrandei</string></dict>

            Taslin Brance was born on the planet Rinn.[1]
            Brance eventually became a major in the ground forces of the Resistance,[3] serving in the Resistance base on D'Qar about 30 years after the Battle of Endor, along with General Leia Organa and others in the Resistance leadership.[4]
            Brance was the first to receive a coded and encrypted transmission informing the Resistance of an attack by First Order stormtroopers against a Jakku community, resulting in the death of Lor San Tekka. The report also noted the destruction of pilot Poe Dameron's X-wing fighter, leading Brance to openly speculate that Dameron and his astromech droid, BB-8, had perished. Organa admonished him for speculation, who noted BB-8's resourcefulness and expressed hope for its survival.[4]
            Brance was also present at the D'Qar base when the Resistance received word that Hosnian Prime, the planet serving as the headquarters for the Galactic Senate, had been destroyed by the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon. Shocked and horrified by the news, Brance was the first to report the planet's destruction to Organa and the other Resistance leaders.[4]
            Taslin Brance was portrayed by Emun Elliott in the film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens (2015). Best known for his roles in the television series Game of Thrones and the science fiction film Prometheus (2012), Elliott had only one line in the film: "A laser cannon?"[5]
            Although his rank badge clearly identifies him as a major,[3] Brance was both referred to and addressed as a lieutenant in Alan Dean Foster's novelization of The Force Awakens.[4]
            Brance's first name "Taslin" was not revealed until the release of the 2016 reference book Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded, written by Pablo Hidalgo.[6] Per Poe Dameron: Flight Log, Dameron calls Brance by the nickname "Tas."[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Taslin_Brance</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTaslinBrance</string></dict>

            During the Cold War, Captain Valon became a dangerous grunt when he launched initial raids against the Rift Alliance coalition forces. After joining the White Maw, Valon became very indistinguishable from the other pirates who flocked to Hoth in search of easy pickings. For his sudden rise, he gathered many followers to serve by his side and take advantage on the Rift Alliance. While he was able to reclaim an advanced "healing armor" for himself, Valon survived several attempts on his life, including the onslaughts from the Rift Alliance coalition forces and failed coups from overambitious lieutenants.
            In 3642 BBY, the first year of the renewed conflict, Valon was faced by the Barsen'thor who aided a a Rift Alliance unit under the command of lieutenant Felix Iresso. After his first defeat by the Jedi Consular, his body armor completely healed him and was willing to have his chance by defeating the Jedi once again. After the Consular managed to disable the armor, Valon was defeated, and pleaded make a deal with the Jedi to be given free rein to harass the Empire in exchange for his life.

            Senator Viento was present during an assassination attempt against Supreme Chancellor Palpatine on Coruscant. Palpatine was saved by Jedi Master Ronhar Kim. As the assassins had been disguised as Senate Guards, Viento suggested a personal guard be created for the Chancellor's protection.
            During the Clone Wars, Viento secretly aligned himself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and planned to sabotage many Loyalist senators' speeders. He also helped arrange for Finis Valorum's assassination, a plot which also involved fallen Jedi Master Sora Bulq and Anzati assassin Sajé Tasha. During this time, Viento had been placed under the protection of Jedi Master K'Kruhk.
            He was assassinated in 22 BBY[1][2] by Quinlan Vos, a Jedi undercover within the Dark Acolytes, who believed him to be Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord whom Count Dooku had mentioned to Obi-Wan Kenobi on Geonosis. Vos had misinterpreted Dooku, who wanted Viento dead for attempting to double-cross him.

        <key>Dak Vesser</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.987.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dak Vesser was a Human male Padawan who served the Jedi Order at the Enclave on Dantooine during the Mandalorian Wars. He was also a close friend of Juhani and Belaya.
            Dak was too passionate, and felt frustrated by the Jedi. Eventually he decided to leave, but before he did he confessed that he loved Juhani and tried to convince her to leave the Order with him. While Juhani was having doubts of her own prior to her eventual fall, she did not return his feelings, and stayed with the Jedi.
            Hurt over her rejection, Dak left Dantooine. Eventually he fell to the dark side and became a student at the Sith Academy on Korriban in 3956 BBY. When Revan arrived on Korriban during his mission to stop Darth Malak, Dak encountered Juhani once again. After speaking with her he decided to leave the Sith Academy. While unsure where he would go, he desired to get away from both the Sith and the Jedi.
            Revan and his other Jedi companions encountered Dak a second time in The Drunk Side, a cantina in Dreshdae. He expressed his desire to be away from Juhani and promised Revan he wouldn't reveal his identity to the Sith.
            If the player is Dark Sided, they can visit Dak in the cantina and provoke him into a fight, killing him. If Juhani is in the party she will prevent the player from killing Dak in the cantina.
            Alternately, if the player does not convince Dak to leave the Sith, and takes the path of killing both Headmasters or redeeming Yuthura Ban, he will be among those who attack the player once the ruse is discovered.

        <key>Voca</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.988.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Voca was a Human male clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire, Voca served as a Stormtrooper commander in the 501st Legion, by then under the command of the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Shortly after the disappearance of Admiral Garoche Tarkin, the son of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, Voca accompanied the Sith and two battalions of the 501st on a mission to locate Tarkin's missing son. During the mission he wore a set of Katarn-class armor distinguished with blue markings. Ultimately, Darth Vader was the only one who survived the assignment; Voca and his stormtroopers were ultimately killed by Atoan insurgents as a result of the treachery of Captain Shale, an Imperial officer who secretly supported Atoa against the New Order of Emperor Palpatine.
            Following a botched assignment to hunt down insurgents in the Ghost Nebula, the Imperial Navy lost contact with an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer under the command of Admiral Garoche Tarkin, son of then-Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. In response, Emperor Palpatine commanded his Sith apprentice Darth Vader to find and retrieve the lost admiral with the assistance of the 501st Legion and Captain Shale. Thus, Commander Voca was assigned to serve at Vader's side with a detachment of two battalions of stormtroopers from the 501st.[3]
            After traveling to the Ghost Nebula, Vader and his Imperials landed on Atoa, a planet that the Galactic Empire possessed little intelligence on. Upon discovering a city not far from the area where they landed, Commander Voca reported to Vader that the settlement possessed at least a few hundred armed soldiers and that a scouting party was approaching the Imperials' position. Vader merely responded by ordering the commander to have the 501st wipe out the scouts; Voca complied without hesitation.[3]
            With brutal and merciless efficiency, the 501st stormtroopers immediately began overwhelming the city's defenders by sheer force of military power, including the firepower of AT-STs and AT-TEs. Commander Voca remained by Vader's side as the Sith Lord participated in the fighting. As the Imperials penetrated deeper into the city, Voca informed Vader that the enemy soldiers were retreating into a watchtower, to which Vader was pleased to learn as he intended to trap them in one location. At that moment however, a lone soldier began shooting at Vader, Voca and the stormtroopers from high ground. Despite having a brief advantage, the soldier was knocked unconscious from behind by Captain Shale. With most of the enemy neutralized, Voca and his troops converged on the watchtower alongside Vader and Shale.[3]
            After analyzing the watchtower's defenses, which included snipers and heavy artillery, it was clear that the Imperials were at a tactical disadvantage. Voca suggested that a walker could effortlessly save them the trouble of destroying the tower, but Vader rejected the idea in favor of capturing the remaining enemy units alive, but only for the purpose of interrogation. While Captain Shale and his troopers covertly climbed up the tower, Vader used the Force to surround the tower in a snowstorm, thus blinding the snipers. Although suffering light casualties in the overall engagement, the plan was a success and the tower was taken; the last of the city's soldiers were captured while the rest were dead. Following Vader's order to the letter, Commander Voca had his stormtroopers secure the tower and escorted remaining enemy soldiers to a river located outside of the city.[3]
            As the captured soldiers knelt down in submission on the bank of the river, Darth Vader demanded that they reveal the location of Admiral Tarkin, or die for failing to do so. The interrogation yielded no relevant information to Vader's assignment, however. As a result, Vader ordered Commander Voca and his stormtroopers to sweep the area a second time and to execute anyone in the city who was old enough to wield firearms, all before burning the city to the ground. Having no personal objections to his new orders, Voca merely asked the Sith Lord as to what should be done with the prisoners, to which Vader ordered that they be drowned in the freezing river.[3]
            Before Voca could carry out any of his orders, however, a boat containing white-robed figures approached the Imperials via the river. The commander raised his weapon to open fire on the mysterious beings, but was ordered by Vader to stand down. A female disembarked from the boat and identified herself as Lady Saro, the High Priestess of Atoa, promising to help Vader and his Imperials in locating whatever they were seeking.[3]
            Shortly after Darth Vader worked out a compromise with Lady Saro in order to utilize her aid in the search for Admiral Tarkin, the Atoan priestess revealed the location of Tarkin's missing Star Destroyer. Accompanied by a squadron of Imperial V-wing starfighters, Commander Voca aided Darth Vader and Captain Shale in searching the Star Destroyer's wreckage in outer space.[4]
            Based on the massive damage to Tarkin's warship, Voca concluded that the explosions had to have occurred from within the vessel, thus indicating that sabotage resulted in the Star Destroyer's destruction. Before his analysis could be given any further thought, however, the Imperials were caught unawares by a surprise attack by Atoan starfighters, which were able to successfully hide in the debris field since the Imperials neglected to thoroughly sweep the entire area. Although initially caught off guard, Voca and the clones succeeded in repelling the Atoans with the aid of Vader and Shale while only sustaining light casualties.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Voca</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVoca</string></dict>
        <key>Ars Veruna</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.989.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ars Veruna, formally styled as His Royal Highness, King Veruna of Naboo, was a male Human who was the last King of Naboo in the waning days of the Galactic Republic. He succeeded King Tapalo and was the immediate predecessor of Queen Amidala.
            A proponent of Naboo's greater integration with the rest of the galaxy, Veruna's political career was heavily-financed and guided by Hego Damask II, secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis. Veruna was dogged by accusations of corruption in the final year of his reign and ultimately clashed with Plagueis. Veruna formed an alliance with Gardulla the Hutt, the Bando Gora, and Black Sun in an effort to salvage his position and to assassinate Plagueis. However, the assassination attempt failed, and terrified of retribution, Veruna abdicated and fled into hiding. Tracked down by Plagueis, Veruna was murdered by him shortly afterwards.
            Ars Veruna was a relation to the Earl of Vis and a member of House Veruna. He was the confidant of Bon Tapalo before Tapalo's ascension to the throne in 65 BBY. Tapalo's campaign supported opening up Naboo's economy to the greater galaxy, and Veruna contacted IBC kingpin Hego Damask—secretly the Muun Sith Lord Darth Plagueis—and Damask Holdings to discuss the possibility of an alliance to export Naboo's plasma reserves.[2]
            Sometime later, Damask and other InterGalactic Banking Clan executives, came to Naboo to formalize their agreement. Damask Holdings ensured that Tapalo became the King of Naboo, with Veruna as governor of Theed. Outer Rim Construction and Assembly and the Trade Federation received contracts to export Naboo's plasma. Over time, however, the alliance came to be seen as exploitative and corrupt: isolationists like Senator Vidar Kim pointed out that the deal allowed the Trade Federation to sell the plasma on at up to twenty times the price it paid the Naboo for it.[2]
            In 52 BBY, Veruna attended the funeral of Senator Vidar Kim's family: they tragically had died in an airspeeder crash. After the funeral, he briefly spoke with Ambassador Palpatine—the clandestine Darth Sidious and apprentice to Plagueis—on how Naboo could deal with the Trade Federation. Many Naboo agreed with Kim's assessment that the agreement for exports was exploitative, but with their own arrangements with the Trade Federation, and not wishing to break with Hego Damask, neither Veruna nor Tapalo wished to antagonize it.[2]
            Palpatine suggested that Senator Kim vote against the Trade Federation in a coming Galactic Senate vote to sit several Federation client systems in the Senate: Naboo would appear to have stood up to galactic conglomerates while the Trade Federation's contracts remained unchanged. Veruna agreed, and suggested that he would see Palpatine replace Kim as senator. In return, Palpatine affirmed Hego Damask's support for Veruna as future King of Naboo.[2]
            Veruna indeed ascended to the throne as King in 46 BBY, largely thanks to a renegotiated contract with the Trade Federation for Naboo's plasma. However, many felt that Veruna had arranged for personal kickbacks from the contract. One of Veruna's first acts in power was to form a state-of-the art Naboo spacefighter corps, unequalled in its quality and technological brilliance by any other starfighter corps in the galaxy.[2]
            At a demonstration of the new N-1 starfighters in 33 BBY with Senator Palpatine, Chief of Security Maris Magneta, and Prime Councilor Kun Lago, Veruna boasted to Palpatine that they would allow the planet to renegotiate its contracts with the Trade Federation from a position of strength. Veruna was increasingly dogged by accusations of corruption and he saw the renegotiation as a chance to regain his position. However, Palpatine warned Veruna that the Galactic Senate was on the point of offering the Trade Federation the right to unlimited armament on its ships in exchange for supporting the taxation of Free Trade Zones. Suggesting that a confrontation would be likely, Palpatine suggested voting against new taxation to stay on the right side of the Trade Federation, or approaching Hego Damask again to help broker a renegotiated deal.[2]
            Veruna was disgusted by the suggestion, fearing that he would be forced from office if he was seen to take the side of the Trade Federation, and had come to utterly loathe Damask for negotiating the initial deals. Veruna bombastically declared to Palpatine that Pax Teem, the late Gran Senator, had done him and all of Damask's enemies a favor in 52 BBY by "forcing him into an early retirement", with his brazen attempt on the Muun's life, which had left Damask maimed.[2]
            Unknown to Veruna, this was an attempt by Palpatine to goad him into a confrontation with the Trade Federation that would destabilise the Republic, as well as push him into making an assassination attempt on Damask, aimed at killing his Sith master. With the Naboo increasingly disgusted by Veruna's corruption and the exploitative contract with the Trade Federation, Palpatine began maneuvering to replace Veruna with the thirteen-year-old Padmé Naberrie.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ars_Veruna</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascArsVeruna</string></dict>

        <key>Maximilian Veers</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.991.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Maximilian Veers was a male Human Major General of the Galactic Empire's Imperial Army, famous for his leadership at the assault on Hoth in 3 ABY and other battles. He also was the father of Zevulon Veers. He died on a suicide mission in 10 ABY.
            Maximilian Veers was the son of a middle-class working family[3] on the ecumenopolis planet of Denon in the Core Worlds.[8] He joined the Imperial Academy and, while there, decided to train towards a career in the Assault Armor Division, where he might operate the mechanical behemoths that were the All Terrain Armored Transports.[5] He believed the massive vehicles introduced during the Clone Wars[9] best embodied his own personality as well as that of the Galactic Empire. He took up his training with rigorous determination, showing a surprising intellect and initiative after emerging from several "suicide missions" by surpassing his mission assignments.[5] Veers graduated at the top of his class,[source?] and, his superiors finding him both skillful and dangerous, was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant upon graduation and an assignment as commander of an AT-AT. As a test of his abilities, he was soon shipped to a barbaric and backwater Outer Rim Territories world called Culroon III.[5]
            The Culroon III campaign was designed to either make or break Veers. If he failed, he was likely to perish.[5] He quickly learned that the Empire did not tolerate incompetence and failure. During the attempt to pacify the natives of Culroon III, General Irrv had ordered for Lieutenant Veers to remain confined to the base while he and an Imperial party went to negotiate a peace with the Culroon natives. Veers had warned that it was a trap and that Irrv should bring armored support to deter any would-be ambushers. General Irrv did not listen and paid the price with his life when he was executed for incompetence after the Culroon natives deceived and killed most of his party. If it had not been for Lieutenant Veers's quick thinking and disregard of a direct order, the Imperial party would have been utterly slaughtered.[source?] For his bravery and brilliance in saving the Culroon mission's stormtrooper detail, Veers was promoted to major.[5]
            Major Veers married and had a son named Zevulon. When Zevulon was only a young boy, Veers lost his wife to a rare disease during a family vacation.[10] Devastated by the death of his wife, Veers buried his grief in his military career. This began to affect his relationship with his son, who he advised to honor his mother by joining the Sub-Adult Group, a youth paramilitary organization of the Empire.[3]
            Veers's devotion to the army seemed to pay off, as he was granted the rank of colonel and the command of an Imperial garrison on Corellia. Veers was also widely recognized as an authority on the AT-AT, and often returned to Carida to guest-lecture at AT-AT training courses and demonstrate prototypes of new AT-AT models. During one of these demonstrations, shortly before 0 ABY, Veers came to the attention of Darth Vader when he defeated a Rebel invasion force.[11]
            At this point, however, Veers's career seemed to stagnate. Veers lacked the aristocratic connections needed to move up in rank,[3] and questions had arisen regarding his methods of career advancement.[5] Worse, during one of the training courses on Carida, a promising Cadet named Davin Felth lowered his walker to its knees in order to prevent the opposing force from exploiting the weakness its long legs presented. The weakness threatened Veers's career, as it was so closely tied to the success of the walkers. Veers buried the incident by reassigning Felth to the infantry.
            Veers had been selected for a position on the first Death Star, as a ground commander, and as an academic instructor. With Felth out of the way, this seemed the perfect opportunity to achieve an elite position. The assignment turned out to be another dead end, as Veers had only just arrived in-system at the Battle of Yavin. A Rebel X-wing fighter spotted his shuttle and forced a crash landing on the jungle moon of Yavin 4. For some time, Colonel Veers survived on emergency rations and local wildlife before he contacted an assault force led by Major Brenn Tantor, which was able to rescue him.[12]
            Having had his new position blown out from under him, Colonel Veers returned to his garrison on Corellia. There he helped CorSec Inspectors Hal and Corran Horn put an end to the criminal Black Sun lieutenant, Zekka Thyne, by storming his fortress on the notion that Thyne was harboring Rebel insurgents. Impressed by Veers's performance in removing Black Sun's presence near Coronet City, Grand Admiral Thrawn recommended the brilliant ground commander to Darth Vader.[13]
            As it turned out, the destruction of the Death Star aided Veers's career in the long run. The deaths of so many high-ranking officers aboard the station had left a power vacuum that Veers stepped into following the raid on Thyne's stronghold.[5]
            Veers was able to continue work in secret on the new AT-AT prototype on Zaloriis, which he described as "the walker". Unexpectedly, the Zalorians declared independence from the Empire and abducted him. He was later rescued by Darth Vader. Together, Vader and Veers completed work on the prototype and used it to crush the Zalorian rebellion, destroying Zaloriis City in the process.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Maximilian_Veers</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMaximilianVeers</string></dict>
        <key>Gar Saxon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.992.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Gar Saxon was a Mandalorian human male who served as a commander of the Mandalorian super commandos in Darth Maul's Shadow Collective during the Clone Wars and later as Imperial Viceroy and Governor of his homeworld of Mandalore during the reign of the Galactic Empire.
            During the Clone Wars Saxon was one of the two-man extraction team that rescued Maul from the Spire on Stygeon Prime and later commanded Maul's ground forces during General Grievous' invasion of the Collective base on Ord Mantell. After the rise of the Empire, Saxon served as Hand to Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine and was the leader of the Imperial Super Commandos until his death on Krownest in 2 BBY.
            {{Quote|Lord Maul &amp;nmaxon, along with Rook Kast, were sent by Mandalore Prime Minister Almec to free Darth Maul from the Spire on Stygeon Prime. The duo managed to successfully free Maul without problem and escape on a Mandalorian Gauntlet fighter towards Zanbar, as instructed by Almec prior to the attack.[8]
            After freeing Maul, Saxon took him to Zanbar's secret Shadow Collective base. General Grievous, under orders from Count Dooku attacked the planet with his droid army. During this attack, Saxon fought alongside his fellow Shadow Collective soldiers. After Grievous' droids defeated the majority of the soldiers, Saxon escaped the brutal battle along with Maul, Kast and other members of the Shadow Collective and headed towards Ord Mantell where they would meet up with members of the Pyke Syndicate and Black Sun at the base on the planet.[8]
            Saxon, on Ord Mantell with the rest of the Shadow Collective, staged the next attack against the Separatist Forces. Saxon was then put in command of the ground forces that would fight the droid army in the attack. Unfortunately, Saxon and his men were defeated and rounded up so that the droids could eliminate them. Luckily, Maul made Grievous turn off the droids command signal which, in turn, allowed Saxon and his men to live another day. With the droids deactivated, Saxon and his men tore the droid army apart. Saxon, then, along with his men, saved the Zabrak Viscus and captured Count Dooku, who had been about the kill the Nightbrother.[4]
            After Ord Mantell, Saxon and the rest of the Shadow Collective escaped to Vizsla Keep 09, a Mandalorian supply outpost near Ord Mantell. By this time, the Republic had been notified of the events on Ord Mantell and sent an attack on the outpost. Saxon was present while Maul told Sidious of the failure of his apprentice and general. He later took Grievous to a high security cell while Maul attempted to persuade Dooku to join him as his new apprentice. Soon, Saxon was forced to take charge of his men when a Republic assault led by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Master Tiplee attacked the outpost. While the assault took place, Maul and his new ally Count Dooku joined the fray around the same time as Mace Windu and the Twi'lek Aayla Secura. Maul began to clash with Secura and Windu while Dooku fought Kenobi and Tiplee. While this occurred, Saxon instructed Kast to shoot a missile at Secura before she defeated Maul. With Secura distracted, Saxon, Kast, Maul, and later Dooku entered a Gauntlet fighter and escaped, leaving Kenobi, Secura, Windu, and a dead Tiplee on the outpost.[9]
            Later, while on course for Dathomir, Maul contacted Ziton Moj, and a Pyke leader via hologram. The two threatened to leave the Shadow Collective if they were not paid what they were promised. Once the leaders left, Maul contacted Saxon and told the commander to keep the two in line. However, this would be for naught, as the Shadow Collective would dissolve shortly thereafter when Separatist fleets attacked the Black Sun and Pyke Syndicate.[10]
            Following the dissolution of the Shadow Collective, Gar Saxon joined the Galactic Empire. Desiring power for himself, Saxon collaborated with the Empire[11] and was installed as Governor of Mandalore by Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine.[2] Saxon's followers became Imperial Super Commandos, Mandalorians who served the Empire. As proxies of the Empire, Saxon and his Imperial Super Commandos enforced the Empire's will on Mandalore. As Viceroy, Saxon donned a distinct red armor and helmet.[11]
            Saxon also had a rivalry with Fenn Rau, the leader of the Mandalorian Protectors, a rival Mandalorian faction based in the Concord Dawn system. In 2 BBY, an opportunity for Saxon to move against Rau emerged when Saxon learned that the Protectors were allowing the rebellion to use the Concord Dawn system as a thorough-way to avoid Imperial sector patrols. In an attempt to lure Rau back to Concord Dawn, as well as to get rid of his rivals, Saxon and his Imperial Super Commandos attacked the Protectors Camp on the third moon of Concord Dawn, leaving no survivors.[5]
            As expected, Rau returned to the third moon of Concord Dawn after learning that contact with his fellow Protectors had been lost. Saxon's plan was complicated by the fact that Rau was accompanied by three of his rebel captors: the Mandalorian girl Sabine Wren, a fellow member of Clan Vizsla; the Jedi apprentice Ezra Bridger; and the astromech droid Chopper. After the rebels attacked and destroyed an Imperial dwarf probe droid, Saxon and his men disembarked from their starship and traveled to the Protectors Camp. Rau and Sabine managed to escape but Saxon and his men captured Ezra and Chopper.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gar_Saxon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGarSaxon</string></dict>

            When he learned of the existence of the Kaiburr crystal and the presence of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, he informed Governor Bin Essada, who in turn informed Darth Vader.

During the chaos, Grammel was injured in an explosion resulting in a significant portion of his face being burned, his right arm having to be "re-formed" and his ear damaged. Upon Darth Vader's arrival, the Sith Lord was disappointed with Grammel over his failure to prevent them from escaping. Worse, Vader took over the command of Grammel's troops.

Serving as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic, Glaive fought bravely until his death on Ohma-D'un in 22 BBY.
            Brought to the Coruscant Jedi Temple for training after being identified as Force-sensitive, Glaive was elevated to the rank of Master following years of independent study and training. After this he selected the young, temperamental Falleen Initiate Zule Xiss to become his apprentice.[1]
            When the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Master Glaive and Padawan Xiss reported to Coruscant to receive orders from the High Council. Appointed the rank of General within the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic, Glaive and his Padawan led clone troopers against the Confederacy's droid horde. Early into the conflict, the Master-Padawan pair was assigned to team up with Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Padawan Anakin Skywalker in investigating the mysterious communications blackout on the Gungan colony moon, Ohma-D'un. Arriving on the moon, the Jedi discovered that a toxic bioweapon had been released on the moon's population and all of the Gungan's wiped out. As they investigated the corpses, the Jedi were ambushed by Asajj Ventress and the bounty hunter Durge. Engaging the two Separatist Commanders, Glaive began to break out in blisters caused from the toxic gases still in the atmosphere. Fighting fiercely against Durge and preventing the death of his Padawan, Glaive was caught off guard by Ventress, who decapitated him with her crimson-bladed lightsaber. Durge bid him a sadistic farewell: "May the Force be with you, meatbag."[1]
            Headstrong and arrogant, Master Glaive was not prone to making friends among his more stoic and meditative colleagues, as demonstrated by his almost antagonistic relationship with fellow Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi. Brutish and intimidating in appearance, Glaive wore a slightly modified Jedi tunic, preferring a sleeveless leather tunic and heavy durasteel gauntlets.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Glaive</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascGlaive</string></dict>

He was a close friend and associate of Duchess Satine Kryze, leader of the New Mandalorians on Mandalore, during the years before and during the Clone Wars. When Duchess Kryze journeyed to Coruscant in order to argue against the Republic's occupation plans for Mandalore, Golec discovered the testimony from Deputy Minister Jerec. The testimony stated that the request that the Republic send troops had been falsified. Risking his life and career in order to bring the full version of the testimony to the Duchess, Golec met with her in a shadowy alley on Coruscant.[1]
            However, Kryze had been followed to Coruscant by a member of the radical Mandalorian splinter group, Death Watch. When the Death Watch assassin found Kryze meeting with Golec, he fired a shot from his sniper rifle, killing Golec. Kryze pulled her blaster to fire back, but was then forced to flee the scene, pursued by the Coruscant Police and Coruscant Guard shock troopers, who believed she had killed Golec. Satine was able to meet with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in secret and gave him the disk, to be given to Senator Padmé Amidala. Kryze turned herself in to the Senate Guard while Amidala delivered Deputy Minister Jerec's true message to the Senate.

        <key>Tag Greenley</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1000.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tag Greenley was a legendary figure who along with his partner Bink Otauna constituted a mischievous duo. It is possible that the duo was based on actual persons, though historians continued to debate their existence.[1]
            Possibly born on Alderaan,[2] he had many adventures with Bink. According to the legend, the two witnessed and also affected several important events of the Imperial Period chronicled in the Journal of the Whills, the exploits of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and the lives of the Skywalkers with outrageous and often hilarious results.
            Born to a Corellian family, Tag was the third child in his family after his sisters Ta-mara and De-hoff, but the first to be Force sensitive. He was, in fact, an unintended result of Darth Plagueis's manipulations of midi-chlorians. Tag was barely Force sensitive, but enough so to be accepted into the Jedi Order, where he met his friend-to-be Bink Otauna, another result of Plagueis' machinations. Both of the boys were weak in the Force, but they were able to scrape their way through their training. In order to stay afloat, Bink attempted to modify their grades by computer, but in the process accidentally deleted Kamino from the Jedi Archives. The two boys, afraid of being caught, fled, and ended up at Dex's Diner.
            There they tried to figure out what to do next, but were forced to run when Jango Fett, upon hearing a waitress' call of "Order 66!", tried to kill them. The two Padawans boarded a freighter bound for Naboo, where they accidentally ran into Anakin Skywalker, who was escorting Padmé Amidala back to her home. The two boys cut a deal with him; he would keep secret about their transgressions and help them get back home, and they would help him with his attempts to woo Padmé. While this worked for a while, when Anakin sensed that his mother Shmi was worred about him and left Naboo, he left the two boys behind, and they were forced to find an alternate way home. However, this was just as the Clone Wars broke out, and as a result it took them three years to make their way back to Coruscant. They arrived at the Jedi Temple just in time to find a massacre taking place. Anakin, now Darth Vader, refrained from killing them, as they had helped him win Padmé over so many years ago. However, he gave them specific orders: to forget they were ever Jedi and leave forever. The two did so, deciding that Tatooine would be a perfect place to hide where nothing would happen.
            Nineteen years later, they had joined the Rebellion and were serving aboard the Tantive IV when it was captured by the Devastator over Tatooine. The two were taken prisoner by a pair of stormtroopers, but were able to overpower them and don their armor. Disguised, they were taken back onboard the Devastator and transferred to the first Death Star. When the Death Star arrived at Alderaan, Bink's homeworld, they stole a pair of TIE fighters and headed for the planet. Unfortunately for them, this was just as Alderaan was destroyed, and the two found themselves in even more trouble when the Millennium Falcon arrived. Bink cautioned Tag not to return to the Death Star, but due to the Falcon's jamming, Tag misheard and did just that, thus luring the Falcon to be captured by the Empire. Still in disguise, the pair were put in charge of guarding the tractor beam power console that Obi-Wan Kenobi would later disable. They were almost called for duty as Darth Vader's wingmen, but managed to give him the slip and steal Grand Moff Tarkin's personal shuttle Tydirium. They were leaving the Death Star just as Luke Skywalker destroyed it, and their hyperdrive was knocked out, forcing them to make a landing on Yavin 4.
            This took them a few months, and by the time they arrived, the Rebels were long gone, the only things left being the leftover trash from the Rebel celebration and a medal reading "Chewie" that had been forgotten. Boba Fett arrived at this point, looking for Han Solo, but the pair got the drop on him. They tied him up and left for Cloud City to find old friend of Tag's, Lando Calrissian. Fett escaped soon after, and the two were shocked to see Slave I awaiting them. Lando wanted them gone, but when Tag reminded him that Lando had been taking credit for Tag's victory at the Battle of Taanab, Lando conceded and left to greet his other guest. The two hid in a room on Cloud City, but when they were surprised by C-3PO, Bink blasted him as payback for getting them caught on the Tantive IV. As a result, Lando made them escort Princess Leia Organa and Chewbacca to safety, but first they were taken to the carbon-freezing chamber, where Chewbacca knocked Tag unconscious. When he came to, the Empire was already taking control of the city, the Princess and Wookiee had already left, and a crowd of Cloud City's enraged inhabitants were pursuing them. Imperial reinforcements arrived in time, though, and the two were able to escape and get back to Mon Mothma and Gial Ackbar, with their captured Imperial shuttle in tow.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tag_Greenley/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTagGreenley</string></dict>
        <key>Hudrow</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1001.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hudrow was a Human male that served as Exchange crime lord Davik Kang's personal pilot for the Ebon Hawk. During the Sith Empire's occupation of Taris, he angered Kang by stealing spice from the spice lab at his estate. In retaliation, Kang had him imprisoned and tortured by K-X12 probe droids in his torture chamber, where he remained just an hour before the destruction of Taris.
            A member of the powerful crime syndicate the Exchange, Hudrow was employed by its crime lord, Davik Kang, as his personal pilot for the Dynamic-class freighter, Ebon Hawk. Reputed to have been the fastest starship in the Outer Rim, the Ebon Hawk was a prized possession of Kang. As the pilot of such a prestigious ship for such a prestigious man, it was inevitable that Hudrow was afforded a measure of prestige as well. Hudrow exploited his status to commit various transgressions without fear of reprisals.
            This changed in 3956 BBY when the Sith Empire occupied Taris, homeworld of Kang, during the Jedi Civil War and imposed a planet-wide quarantine. The blockade was reinforced by the auto-targeting laser cannons of the Sith fleet, which could immediately incinerate any vessel that attempted to flee the planet without the authorized access codes. Despite its speed, not even the Ebon Hawk could escape these laser cannons, effectively grounding the vehicle. With the Ebon Hawk rendered useless, Hudrow's role was for the time being irrelevant, and his status temporarily voided.
            Thus, when Hudrow was caught stealing spice from the spice lab at the estate, he was not spared punitive measures. Incurring Kang's wrath, he was imprisoned in a force cage at the "guest" room—actually a torture chamber—where he was subjected to continuous torture by two K-X12 probe droids.
            Fortunately for Hudrow, the Galactic Republic soldier Revan had just infiltrated the estate under the guise of a potential recruit brought by the Mandalorian mercenary Canderous Ordo, one of Kang's top henchmen. Having already acquired the proper departure codes, Ordo and Revan, alongside Revan's friends, sought to steal the Ebon Hawk and escape the blockade. The hangar of the ship, however, was sealed by an impregnable security system which Hudrow, as the pilot, had the means to access.
            After Revan heard of Hudrow's plight by questioning the slaves, he ventured into the torture room to free the pilot from his suffering, destroying the K-X12 probe droids in the process.
            In gratitude, Hudrow, lacking anything tangible to give, uploaded the access codes to bypass the Ebon Hawk's security system into Revan's datapad. Even without knowing that this was exactly what Revan needed, he figured that access to the Ebon Hawk was a reward worth a fortune. With that, he parted ways from his saviors, rushing to flee the estate before Kang discovered his escape.
            Unbeknownst to him, just moments later, Revan and his group encountered Kang and the infamous bounty hunter Calo Nord in the hangar, a confrontation that would leave Kang dead and Nord severely injured just as the Sith began their orbital bombardment to destroy the entire planet.
            Hudrow is a non-player character in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. His reward for saving him from torture, the access codes to the hangar of the Ebon Hawk, is a crucial part to the player's main quest to escape the planet with the ship. Even so, it is not the only means by which the player can reach the Ebon Hawk as he or she can alternatively deactivate the security system after slicing into a security terminal, a method that costs up to ten computer spikes depending on the Computer Use level of the character being used. Accessing the computer itself will cost one to two spikes unless the player loots the computer passcard from a Trandoshan bounty hunter in the corridor outside the torture chamber. While it is not known if the player's character, Revan, canonically forgoes rescuing Hudrow and relies on hacking the security system instead, unlocking the hangar doors through Hudrow's access codes is the more efficient way of reaching the Ebon Hawk.
            If the player takes the dark side route, he or she can murder Hudrow after rescuing him, under the pretense that the man may warn the guards and is too dangerous to be spared. If either Bastila Shan or Carth Onasi are present, they will object, but only the latter will automatically prevent you from going through with the kill whereas you can proceed with it in spite of the former's intervention. Additional dark side points will be gained if the player threatened Hudrow prior to killing him with the assertion that the reward was lacking. The player will not receive light side points for his or her act in releasing Hudrow or for sparing his life to confirm the intention is to save him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hudrow</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHudrow</string></dict>

        <key>Tobbi Dala</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1003.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tobbi Dala was a male Human Mandalorian who fought under Mandalore the Resurrector and Fenn Shysa during the Clone Wars and subsequent Imperial Period. He died liberating his world from Suprema and the Galactic Empire.
            Tobbi Dala was one of only three Mandalorian Protectors (alongside Spar and Fenn Shysa) that survived the Clone Wars following a Republic trap at Norval II that devastated the Protectors. Only Dala and Shysa returned to Mandalore when the fighting was over, as Alpha-Ø2 was too shell-shocked from the war to be of use.
            Much of this backstory was dismissed as fabrication when Leia Organa traveled to Mandalore sometime after the Battle of Hoth, during the search for Han Solo. She discovered that Shysa and Dala had returned to find that their planet had been overrun by slavers, and both set out to destroy the slave trade and return control of the planet to the Mandalorians.
            Tobbi was captured shortly before Shysa captured the bounty hunter Dengar, and the opposing sides agreed to exchange captives. However, Leia demanded to talk to Dengar, and the plan was thwarted. Tobbi was imprisoned by the Suprema, Ampotem Za, who displayed his Mandalorian armor in a trophy case. He was later freed by Fenn Shysa and Leia Organa, but was shot in the chest during their escape by Za. Despite being fatally wounded, Tobbi managed to grab Za's weapon, allowing the others to escape the slavers' office.
            In the ensuing chase, Tobbi managed to close the base's blast doors as a group of airspeeders launched to chase after Shysa and Organa. The airspeeders exploded, setting off a chain reaction that destroyed the base and killed every being inside.
            With his sacrifice, the slavery of Mandalore was ended once and for all.
            Dala was included as part of Hasbro's 'comic two-pack' figure set for 2008. His figure depicts him with light brown hair, although he is bald in the comic.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tobbi_Dala</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTobbiDala</string></dict>

His tongue was cut out by the Crimson Dawn syndicate when he and the other villages stood up to them; however, he was still able to maintain an effective silent communications network. In 10 BBY, he was present when the Cloud-Riders and a group of criminals formerly affiliated with Crimson Dawn joined together with the villagers to oppose the syndicate.
            Krysguld Darti was a human male who lived in a village constructed in the ruins of the Bis Refinery on the Pnakotic Coast of his homeworld Savareen.[1] Like the other inhabitants of the village, he had had his tongue cut out by the Crimson Dawn syndicate after the villagers stood up to the criminals and refused to pay tribute.[2] He worked as a lookout for the village, keeping an eye on any approaching starships from a beach near the village and gauging whether or not they posed a threat to his community.[1]
            When Dartis believed danger was coming he would send a tap-code command to the villagers, warning them to hide in burrows and cove shallows until the threat had passed.[1] In 10 BBY,[3] he was present in the village when a group of Crimson Dawn affiliates led by the criminal Tobias Beckett landed in order to process coaxium they had stolen from the planet Kessel. He then witnessed the stand-off between the criminals and the Cloud-Riders gang and aided the two groups when they worked together to defeat the forces of the Crimson Dawn when they arrived on Savareen to collect the coaxium.[2]
            Krysguld Dartis had a keen eye and was able to maintain an effective silent communications network. He had dark skin, brown eyes and black hair.[1]
            Dartis used a tap-code comlink and a location transponder which he wore around his neck and carried a club with a head that could be electrified by turning a dial beneath it. Like the rest of his villages he wore striped robes of many colors.[1]
            Krysguld Dartis first appeared in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story[2] and was first named in the accompanying reference book Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Krysguld_Dartis</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKrysguldDartis</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Marr</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1005.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Marr was a Human male Dark Lord of the Sith and a member of the reconstituted Sith Empire's ruling Dark Council during the Great Galactic War, Cold War, and Galactic War with the Galactic Republic. A fearsome warrior and stalwart defender of the Empire, Darth Marr was born in 3702 BBY and assumed a seat on the Dark Council in his early twenties, leading the Sphere of Defense of the Empire as he drove back entire armies and halted Republic offensives during the Great War. By the end of the war in 3653 BBY, Marr had trained an apprentice by the name of Darth Lachris to the rank of Sith Lord and was one of only seven remaining Councilors. He continued to strengthen Imperial defenses and prepare for the inevitable conflict throughout the Cold War, distancing himself from the power plays and treachery that plagued the Council and weakened the Empire.
            As war broke out with the Republic, Marr watched as the Dark Council's numbers dwindled thanks to both the enemy and internal feuding, and he assumed a leadership role alongside fellow Councilors Darth Mortis and Darth Ravage after the deaths of Darth Baras and Darth Decimus, the heads of the Spheres of Military Offense and Military Strategy, left him in sole command of the Imperial Military.
            A Human male, the individual later known as Darth Marr was born in 3702 BBY in the territory of the resurgent Sith Empire. However, Marr's history was shrouded in secrecy: anyone who possessed knowledge of his past refused to reveal anything they knew after the Sith Lord came to power. Trained as a Sith Warrior, Marr adopted an armored battle suit like many powerful Sith, and Marr's armor and emotionless mask were designed to invoke the idea of a monstrous Sithspawn creature.[1] Marr recovered the lightsaber of the ancient Sith Lord Tulak Hord on the planet Dromund Fels shortly before his ascension to the Sith Empire's ruling Dark Council,[8] a position that he achieved sometime around the beginning of the Great Galactic War with the Galactic Republic[9] in 3681 BBY[10] Like the other eleven members of the Council, Marr headed one of the Empire's Spheres of Influence—in Marr's case, the Sphere of Defense of the Empire.[1]
            Around 3678 BBY, Darth Marr and several other Dark Councilors confronted the Sith Lord Calypho on the world of Korriban, arresting him for heresy just as Calypho's apprentice Teneb Kel returned from a mission into the planet's ancient tombs. Kel was allowed to participate in the Imperial offensive on Begeren, but after the Invasion of Begeren ended the apprentice was arrested as well. Darth Marr led parades in the streets of Kaas City on the Imperial capital of Dromund Kaas in celebration of the victory, but he afterwards attended a meeting of the Council in their chamber beneath the Imperial Citadel. There, Kel was brought before Darth Marr and the other Dark Councilors and ordered to kill Lord Calypho. Marr noticed that the young Sith drew strength from his fear, causing another Councilor to mock Kel for not drawing upon his anger. When a Councilor halted the battle before Calypho's death, the Sith was taken away by Imperial Guardsmen to be tortured, and Marr reminded the apprentice that he was not special—his master had made him into a disgrace.[9]
            However, Marr and several other Councilors recognized that Kel could still be of use as a weapon, and Marr revealed a hologram of the apprentice's target: Exal Kressh, the wayward apprentice of the Sith Emperor. The Dark Councilor brushed aside Kel's questions, informing the young Human that his place in the Empire would be judged again if he succeeded in the mission. He then brought Kel before the Emperor himself, bowing low as the Sith ruler informed Marr's chosen assassin that Kressh could be found in the Lenico system.[9] Kel would eventually successfully track down and kill Kressh on Korriban, though not before learning that the Emperor intended to create his Children—extensions of his will that would spread his influence secretly across the galaxy.[11] During the young Human's report to the Dark Council, he refused to submit to their authority and prompted Darth Marr to summon a storm of Force lightning as a threat. However, Kel convinced the Council to accept his offer: in exchange for information on the Emperor's plans, the Dark Council would grant him the rank of Sith Lord and the title of Darth Thanaton.[12]
            As the Great Galactic War continued, Darth Marr attained a fearsome reputation among both the Republic and the Empire, leading Imperial forces into battle and defending the Empire's conquests against Republic counterattacks with fearless determination.[1] In 3660 BBY,[13] Darth Marr drove back a Republic offensive against Korriban, and he dealt the enemy another grievous defeat when the Republic attempted to strike at Ziost.[1] By the end of the war, Marr had trained an apprentice of his own in Darth Lachris, who was a fierce warrior at heart who understood the bitter necessity of politics like her master.[7] He also took an interest in certain Force-sensitive individuals within the Empire, such as the brother of Talos Drellik, and would often personally take them to the Sith Academy on Korriban.[14] Marr was known throughout the Republic as the masked Dark Councilor who had defeated entire armies and halted dozens of Republic assaults,[1] and he was one of only seven members of the Dark Council who was still alive by the time[15] the Treaty of Coruscant ended the war in 3653 BBY.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Marr</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthMarr</string></dict>
        <key>Datoo</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1006.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Datoo was a human male military officer who held the rank of colonel in the First Order. Around thirty years after the Battle of Endor, Datoo was in charge of the primary fire control room on the First Order's Starkiller Base superweapon.[1] Under orders from Supreme Leader Snoke, he oversaw the weapon as it destroyed the Hosnian system, the location of the New Republic Galactic Senate. The weapon then began preparing to fire on the Ileenium system, where the Resistance headquarters was located; however, Resistance forces then attacked the superweapon. As it became clear the base was going to be destroyed, Datoo was shocked to see Lieutenant Rodinon trying to leave the control room, and questioned where he was going, although the latter talked back and bluntly pointed out that they needed to evacuate or else they won't survive, citing that even the base's commander, Hux, had already evacuated. Starkiller Base then exploded.[2]
            Datoo was a methodical officer who believed that the destructive power of Starkiller Base should command respect from all members of the First Order. He wore a teal First Order army uniform with a crested command cap and a band on the left arm written in Aurebesh that commemorated the Imperial Warlord Kaplan.[1]
            Datoo was portrayed by Rocky Marshall[3] in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, which was released in 2015. The character was not identified in the film, but was named in Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary, which was written by Pablo Hidalgo and released the same day as the film. The character is also identified by name in the subtitles on the film's home video release. It is unknown as to whether he escaped the destruction of Starkiller Base, as no other ships are seen leaving the explosion besides the Millennium Falcon and several T-70 X-wing starfighters.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Datoo</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDatoo</string></dict>
        <key>Dass Jennir</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1007.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dass Jennir was a Human male Jedi Master who served as a general during the Clone Wars, and survived Order 66. During the Clone Wars, he was stationed on New Plympto, leading the Galactic Republic's war effort against the Separatist Nosaurians. Several months into the campaign on New Plympto, Jennir's clone troopers executed Order 66—declaring all Jedi enemies of the Republic—and attempted to kill Jennir. He evaded them, eventually finding refuge among the Nosaurians he had been fighting against. Jennir led the Nosaurians into battle against the Republic's successor, Palpatine's Galactic Empire, though they incurred heavy losses; of the New Plympto resistance soldiers, only Jennir and his friend Bomo Greenbark survived the Battle of Half-Axe Pass.
            The two companions left the planet in Captain Schurk-Heren's smuggling ship, the Uhumele, traveling to Orvax IV, where Greenbark's wife and child were being kept as slaves. Greenbark's wife had been killed and his daughter had been sold on, though Jennir managed to procure the identity of Resa Greenbark's seller, Orso Meeto, and broke the Jedi Code when he killed Meeto. The Uhumele ferried Jennir and Bomo to Esseles, where Resa's buyer, Dezono Qua, lived; they attacked his fortress, cornering him, but Qua had already killed Bomo's daughter and eaten her. Jennir murdered the man, but Greenbark and the Uhumele ultimately left Esseles without him. He continued to live his life as a Jedi, however, vowing to stay true to the Jedi Code and find redemption. His travels took him to Cato Neimoidia, but he quickly ran low on funds and had to accept a job that rankled with his Jedi teachings, which quickly saw him facing overwhelming odds.
            He also met Ember Chankeli, and after finishing the job the two left for Vondarc, but crash-landed on Prine. After a two-week trek through the desert, Chankeli was captured by pirates. In the meanwhile, the assassin Falco Sang was hunting Jennir.
            Jennir attempted to rescue Chankeli, whom he had begun to develop feelings for, but failed, and Sang took Chankeli, meaning to lure Jennir into a trap. Though Jennir saw through this, Chankeli was shot by Sang's droid. Sang fled, and when Jennir attempted to heal Chankeli with the Force, he passed out from the effort. He later woke on board of the Uhumele, with Bomo Greenbark at his side. The two friends were overjoyed to see each other again, and Jennir learned that Chankeli had survived, being healed by Beyghor Sahdett. Jennir became romantically involved with Chankeli.
            A Force-sensitive Human male, Dass Jennir was trained in the ways of the Jedi Order, living in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. He was regarded by his superiors as having a poor connection to the Force, and being "average" in every respect, though he did not fail when it came to concentrating. When one Jedi Master reported to Grand Master Yoda that Jennir would never become a "great Jedi", the young Padawan sullenly listened nearby, hidden behind a pillar.[4] His master taught him that if he could not walk away from a fight, he should take control of it, forcing his opponent to fight him on his own terms. Jennir never forgot the lesson.[3] At one point, Yoda told him that even with his average abilities, the galaxy still needed him.
            Jennir was made a Jedi Master by the time of the Clone Wars, becoming a Jedi General of the Grand Army of the Republic when the galaxy-spanning conflict began.[5] Close to the war's end, he was sent to the planet New Plympto, located within the Core Worlds. Commanding a sizable contingent of clone troopers, Jennir was tasked with dealing with the native Nosaurian population—who had allied themselves with the Confederacy of Independent Systems—as well a large amount of Separatist battle droids,[1] and reclaiming the world.[5] They fought many battles during the Clone Wars, and Jennir found the Nosaurians to be determined fighters.[1]
            In 19 BBY, Jennir's clone troopers—like those in every other unit of the Grand Army of the Republic—were told to execute Order 66, which dictated that all Jedi were enemies of the Republic, and were to be killed immediately. He was able to evade his attackers, however; confused and disoriented, he fled into the forest, hiding from his pursuers in the underbrush. Eventually, the clones left the area to continue their search elsewhere, and Jennir continued his flight into the jungle. Eventually, he encountered Bomo Greenbark, a lone Nosaurian soldier. Greenbark was unarmed, his weapons lying on the ground beside him; fearing that the Nosaurian would alert the clones to his presence, Jennir attacked him. He managed to pin Greenbark down, and made him swear to be extremely cautious and quiet. Eventually, however, Greenbark realized that Jennir was a Jedi, and gathered up his weapons, ready to strike. The Jedi Master was able to calm him down, telling him that changing circumstances meant that the two were on the same side. To Jennir's sadness, Greenbark confirmed to him what he had feared—throughout the galaxy, many Jedi had been slaughtered by the soldiers under their command.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dass_Jennir</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDassJennir</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Venemal</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1008.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Venemal was a Human male Sith Lord that served the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War. He served alongside the Sith Lord Darth Malgus during the Empire's attack on the planet Ord Radama, which was successful at first. However, the Sith forces led by Venemal and Malgus were not resupplied, and their fleet in orbit was attacked by Galactic Republic vessels. Venemal—who remained in the capital Livien Magnus while Malgus attempted to aid in the space battle—was killed with the city's populace when a crippled Imperial Harrower-class dreadnought crashed into Livien Magnus.
            Darth Venemal, a Human male, served as a Sith Lord in the resurgent Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War, a galaxy–spanning conflict between the Empire and the Galactic Republic.[1] In the year 3660 BBY,[2] during the Empire's campaign to secure worlds in the Outer Rim Territories, Venemal and the Sith Lord Darth Malgus were tasked with leading Imperial forces—including a legion of soldiers and small fleet of Navy warships— to recapture the planet Ord Radama in the Esstran sector.[1] During the Jedi Civil War approximately three hundred years earlier, the planet had been allied with the Sith Lords Darth Revan and Darth Malak's Sith Empire, but was brought back into the Republic following the Jedi Civil War's end.[3]
            Their assault was initially successful and after about twenty days of fighting, their forces had captured the city Livien Magnus, Ord Radama's capital. The Dark Council dispatched Lord Adraas to assist Malgus and Venemal, and Adraas attempted to take credit for the pair's success.
            However, the Sith forces on the planet were not resupplied and they were eventually overcame; Venemal was killed when a Harrower-class dreadnought crashed in the center of Livien Magnus. Malgus could sense his pain and death, along with that of a hundred thousand others. The Sith Empire was forced to withdraw from Ord Radama, and Malgus received some of the blame for Venemal's death and the defeat.
            Darth Venemal was created by Daniel Wallace and was featured in the 2012 publication Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side. Wallace intended Venemal's name to be a reference to the "Veni, vidi, vici" quote of the statesman Julius Caesar.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Venemal</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthVenemal</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Vengean</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1009.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Vengean was a male Human Sith Lord of the Sith Empire; he was the Sith Master of Darth Baras and a member of the Dark Council. He was the Dark Council's military leader and a warmonger seeking to re-ignite war with the Republic and finally exterminate the foe that drove the Sith into exile a millennium ago. Vengean was openly outraged when the Treaty of Coruscant was signed into law, criticizing all who supported the peace accord and even quietly disparaging the Sith Emperor. His survival of such insolence was a testament to his power. Darth Vengean and Baras spent years carrying out deft political manipulations and quiet assassinations in tandem, both against the Republic and within the Empire.
            During the Cold War, Vengean began plotting to reignite the war. He tasked Baras to eliminate General Karastace Gonn, who had been preventing the Empire from conquering the fringe systems. Baras dispatched his latest apprentice, a powerful Sith Warrior, to perform this task. This allowed Vengean to dispatch his flagship to begin his conquest. However, Republic Admiral Monk, revealed to be Baras' spy, was waiting and ambushed the flagship, destroying Vengean's credibility and dissolving the Treaty of Coruscant.
            When Plan Zero was completed, Baras recalled the Warrior back to Dromund Kaas to discuss Vengean's downfall. Because of his blunder at Quesh, the Dark Council called out for Vengean's head. Baras sent the Warrior into Vengean's sanctum to free Lord Draahg, Vengean's apprentice, who was secretly working for Baras. But Vengean found out before the warrior could rescue Draahg and incarcerated him. After freeing Draahg, the two worked together to break into Vengean's inner sanctum, where the Dark Lord was gathering his strength. Faced with his opponents, Vengean swore to bleed Draahg anew before turning to the Warrior. He reminded the young Sith that Baras wouldn't have gotten to where he was today without the help of his strong enforcer. He called Baras a coward, plotting from the shadows, whereas the Warrior and Vengean himself were people of action. Vengean proceeded to duel with the apprentice of Baras and lost, allowing Baras to ascend to Vengean's seat on the Dark Council.
            Darth Vengean was a Human male with light skin and red eyes. Vengean was known as a man of action and a warmonger. He hated those who betrayed him, as he threatened to bleed Draahg and destroy Baras for betraying him.
            Darth Vengean was skilled with his single-bladed Sith lightsaber. Vengean was also powerful in the dark side of the Force and was capable of Force choke and telekinesis.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Vengean</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthVengean</string></dict>

        <key>Dace Diath</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1011.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dace Diath was a male Human and one of many Jedi Knights who trained under Master Vodo-Siosk Baas. He spent the majority of his early life on Tatooine being taught his initial training by his father, the Jedi Master Sidrona Diath. Upon completion of the training, he traveled to Ossus and became an apprentice to Master Vodo. He would eventually be one of the Jedi sent as reinforcements to help Ulic Qel-Droma during the Freedon Nadd Uprising on Onderon. He later participated in the Convocation at Mount Meru on Deneba and fought against the Krath during the Great Sith War.
            He was an experienced and talented pilot, and while on Onderon learned to fly one of the Beast Rider's war beasts. Dace Diath, along with fellow Jedi Qrrrl Toq and Shoaneb Culu, was killed when Aleema Keto used Sith powers to destroy a star in the Cron Cluster. He was an ancestor of Jedi Master Nico Diath and Padawan Tae Diath.
            Dace Diath was born the son of the famous Jedi Master Sidrona Diath[1] at some point before 4017 BBY,[2] and Dace grew up on the desert planet of Tatooine. The remoteness of Tatooine permitted Sidrona to begin training his son in the ways of the Jedi, eventually leading Dace to the place where he could achieve a deep understanding of the Force. His father's training, coupled with the isolated environment he found himself in, allowed Dace to touch the Force and let it flow through him unhindered. However, even though he was able to open himself up to the Force, and pushed himself to be the best student he could, Dace found that he was still learning slowly. That led Dace to consider abandoning his Jedi training, not because he disliked the rigid lifestyle he was forced to live, but mainly because he did not want to disappoint his father. If he did not try, he reasoned, then he could not fail.[1]
            His father recognized these times of self-doubt in his son and did all he could to strengthen Dace's confidence in himself and his faith in the Jedi way. During one of these times, Sidrona realized that it was usually those Jedi who had worked the hardest and most diligently in their studies of the Force, that became the most capable and gifted teachers; they could better understand the hardships their students faced, and therefore help guide them to a resolution. Sidrona constantly reminded his son of that, and therefore convinced Dace that he was not alone in his difficulties, and that he might one day be able to assume the mantle of a Jedi Master.[1]
            Sidrona Diath routinely trained Dace in the Jundland Wastes, on both the physical and mental sides of the Force. After one especially frustrating day of training in the Wastes, Dace lost all faith in his abilities. As in previous times, Dace went to his father for support, but that time Sidrona did not offer any words of comfort. Instead, he told Dace that he needed now to learn to rely on the Force unconditionally and to look inward to discover his destiny rather than rely on outside support. Dace, fairly surprised and rather upset at his father's words, wandered away from his home and into the dying light of dusk—trying to focus his thoughts on the Force and his problem.[1]
            He wandered aimlessly throughout the surrounding landscape, the long minutes spanning into even longer hours, fighting with the confusion and inner turmoil that had taken over his mind. He drifted until he was half-frozen, and found himself on the edge of the Dune Sea. Then, he saw through the swirling mists of confusion in his mind, and began to recall things from the depths of his memories. The one memory that rushed to the forefront was when his father had taken him as a young child to Ossus to visit the Great Jedi Library. While there, he had inspected a Jedi holocron, and the gatekeeper had spoken to the young Dace Diath. Dace recalled that the gatekeeper had spoken to him of how a Jedi who tries and does not give up, will never fail—and that a Jedi who does give up not only fails himself, but also the Force.[1]
            Pondering on what the gatekeeper had told him, Diath finally realized that it was his own way of thinking that had resulted in all his difficulties. He concluded that if he could just practice, train, and learn under his father without all these negative personal feelings about his progress, then he would not be hampered any longer, and he would therefore succeed. On his way back to his father's home, he likewise came to the understanding that his father had declined him help, because he would never accept these revelations if someone else had presented him with them; he had to illuminate and discover his own path, and believe in it without question. Otherwise, if he never accepted his own destiny fully, then he would never overcome his own self-doubt.[1]

        <key>Dorian Janarus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1012.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dorian Janarus was a Human male who was elected as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic in order to replace Paran Am-Ris. General Elin Garza of the Republic Special Forces Division, Governor  Leontyne Saresh of Taris, and the Mantellian Separatist Movement were among his political rivals.
            When the Galactic Republic was at war, Janarus had long served as a loyal leader to his people and the Republic as senator of Coruscant. However, the Sith Empire brutally ended the war with a surprise invasion that would later be known as the Sacking of Coruscant, with the Sith Lord Darth Angral killing the Supreme Chancellor Berooken during the commotion. When the Galactic Senate met sometime after the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, Janarus was unanimously elected to take up the office of Supreme Chancellor Paran Am-Ris,[2] who had been serving as Chancellor in the interim.[3]
            In the years since his inauguration, the unified support of his peers had steadily diminished as many system governments continued to chafe at the costs of rebuilding, and his military advisers grew increasingly frustrated with his refusal to take sterner action to stamp out sedition, but Janarus's stance had always been that the Republic's core values of freedom, justice, and the right to self-governance were much more important to protect when standing in the face of the brutally tyrannical Sith Empire. During his tenure, Janarus established the Republic Privateer Service Corps.
            During this period, Janarus also looked to the Jedi Council for help, such as when a series of vital and powerful worlds threatened to permanently sever all ties and relationships with the Republic known as the Rift Alliance emerged, Janarus called upon the Council to seek a likely candidate who was a skilled diplomat and would make an excellent representative and ambassador for convincing the Rift Alliance to stay with the Republic. The first name to be mentioned was that of a powerful and notable Jedi Consular, who had recently became the third Barsen'thor in galactic history. The Barsen'thor successfully convinced the Rift Alliance to join the Republic, but only after coming to their aid against from the Empire, particularly the Children of the Emperor, mysterious assassins and shadow hands of the Sith Emperor himself that were infused with the Emperor's thoughts and strength.
            
            After Janarus met with Jedi Master Jun Seros, he publicly condemned the actions of the bounty hunter for allegedly causing the deaths of a Jedi and Republic delegation on Nar Shaddaa, among a kilometer-long list of other charges falsified by Seros. A large bounty was placed on the Hunter's head, forcing the Hunter to go underground and the Empire to sever its ties with them.
            The Hunter was summoned by Darth Tormen, who offered revenge against both Janarus and Seros. But as the two were on Coruscant, far beyond the Hunter's reach, Tormen devised a way to draw them out. By having the Hunter ensure Corellia's secession from the Republic into the Empire, Janarus would be forced to ratify the treaty and withdraw Republic forces. Seros managed to convince him that he could rally Corellia's Green Jedi to liberate the planet from Imperial rule. The Hunter killed Seros and took his effects, providing access to Janarus' flagship, the Founder. Confronted by the very bounty hunter he wronged, Janarus stated that he had already discovered the extent of Seros' actions and the significant resources the slain Jedi had expended to capture Kellian Jarro's murderer. He didn't condone the Hunter's actions, but understood that they were only doing their job. He explained that he had already disclosed Jun's actions to the public, effectively clearing the Hunter's name of the false crimes. The political fallout would be tremendous and regardless of what happened between them, Janarus would be removed from office. He even offered to grant immunity for the Hunter's true crimes in exchange for killing Tormen, whom he accused of being a mass murderer. The Hunter refused his offer and killed the Chancellor.
            After Janarus's death, an emergency session of the Senate was convened, and Janarus's political rival Governor Leontyne Saresh of Taris was elected as Chancellor.
            Supreme Chancellor Janarus was a dedicated servant of the Republic who stood up to uphold the Republic's ideals in a time of political upheaval. He demonstrated a great capacity for leadership after the Sacking of Coruscant by uniting the people and restoring stability. Nevertheless, he had a number of political rivals.
            Janarus is identified in an entry on The Old Republic website's Holonet databank which features Aurebesh phrases such as "Key to Corellia," and "Dangerous Friends." He is voiced by Robert Clotworthy, who also voiced Senator Evran.
            Janarus is the main focus of Chapter III of the Bounty Hunter storyline. For light side points, the Bounty Hunter has the option of sparing his life and forcing him to "face the music". Following the light side path, the Hunter can agree to kill Darth Tormen in exchange for immunity. After the task is done, Janarus upholds his end of the bargain and states that even if his successor questions the justification, overturning the Hunter's exoneration will be more difficult. He then announces that he's retiring from politics, considering that arranging assassinations have caused him to fall far from his principles. The Hunter can optionally encourage Janarus to maintain his honor, wherever he goes.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dorian_Janarus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDorianJanarus</string></dict>
        <key>Dengar</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1013.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dengar, also known as "Payback," was a Corellian bounty hunter and the pilot of the Punishing One. Brought up in the culture of swoop bikes and becoming a successful racer himself, Dengar also led a double life as a successful bounty hunter during the Clone Wars, becoming one of the galaxy's most efficient mercenaries; his work teamed him with the likes of bounty hunters such as Boba Fett and Bossk. Dengar would eventually give up the life of bounty hunting to pursue his other passion: swoop racing.
            Following a grievous injury sustained at the hands of the smuggler Han Solo during a swoop race through Agrilat Swamp on Corellia, Dengar was rebuilt by the scientists of the Galactic Empire as an assassin, augmented by various neuro-implants and cybernetic enhancements and being void of all emotions besides rage, despair, and hope. Dengar served under the Empire until he refused to kill the Holy Children of Asrat; sensing the despair in the children, Dengar deserted his post and became a freelance gun-for hire. It was after a bounty was posted on Han Solo by the Empire that he became entangled in the Galactic Civil War, serving under the Rebel Alliance in Echo Base on Hoth with the intention of taking Solo when he had the chance. Due to a chance encounter, Dengar was among an elite group of hunters recruited by Darth Vader to capture Solo and the passengers of the Millennium Falcon shortly after the Battle of Hoth.
            Dengar was born on Corellia and as a young child, he worked with his father repairing and tuning swoops. This early experience lead to him becoming a well-known and successful swoop racer for the Ferini team during his youth. By the time he reached pre-adolescence, he was considered something of a cult hero throughout the Corellian system. Through his connections with the Ferini team, he gained endorsements and higher wages and winnings.
            By 21 BBY, Dengar had established himself as a bounty hunter, keeping a respectable track record. He eventually became a member of a posse of hunters consisting of Boba Fett, Bossk, Latts Razzi, C-21 Highsinger, and Oked. Dengar and company were hired to escort a hovertrain containing cargo valuable to Otua Blank, the leader of the Belugan people of Quarzite. Dengar and company prepared for the mission on Tatooine, making a last minute addition to the team: Asajj Ventress, a (unbeknownst to them) Dark Jedi who killed Oked in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina.[4]
            Dengar and company set off in the Hound's Tooth to Quarzite, where Major Rigosso transported the team to the train's subterranean loading dock via a space elevator from an orbital skyhook. Dengar, along with Ventress, were assigned to guard the rear of the train. After unsuccessfully flirting with Ventress, a team of skilled Kage Warriors boarded the train in an attempt to retrieve the cargo. Dengar managed to fight off many of the attackers due to his skilled hand-to-hand combat techniques, and even managed to kill two using sticky explosives. Dengar was eventually overwhelmed by the attackers and was thrown from the train, landing safely on the subterranean surface. Dengar and his allies, who were likewise thrown from the train, returned to the skyhook to await Ventress, who had betrayed the mission objective by swapping the cargo with Boba Fett, who was bound and gagged.[4]
            Dengar was employed soon by the Hutts alongside Latts, Embo, and Sugi as protection on Nal Hutta. They were present when Darth Maul, Savage Opress, and Death Watch leader, Pre Vizsla came to ally with the Hutts. When the plan went sour, the four bounty hunters attacked, though they were pushed by the Mandalorian's flamethrower. The trio soon received reinforcements and attacked. When the battle was clearly lost, Dengar and Latts saved the beaten Embo and Sugi by covering their escape with smoke grenades. The group of mercenaries fled the Death Watch and their Sith allies.
            At some point prior to 3 ABY, Dengar, having mastered the professional swoop circuit on Corellia, was called to the private tour, where more dangerous challenges awaited him.[2][5] He was constantly compared to a young swoop jockey on the private circuit named Han Solo. Eager to prove his superiority, Dengar challenged Solo to a winner-takes-all race through the crystal swamps of Agrilat. On the final stretch of the race, Solo brought his swoop down directly over and in front of Dengar, burning his face in the swoop's exhaust and locking the repulsor fins of both swoops. The maneuver sent Dengar flying off of his swoop to crash headfirst into crystalline plants. One crystalline stem directly impaled his brain, leaving him in a condition so perilous that only the Empire's doctors had the ability to repair him to a near-natural state. Dengar was kicked out of professional swoop racing for engaging in the illegal race and was abandoned by his friends on the Ferini team. Part of the Agrilat Swamp Racing Circuit eventually became known as Dengar's End, in honor of his accident.[6] With his life in ruins, Dengar became viciously embittered with Solo, upon whom he vowed his vengeance.[2][5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dengar/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDengar</string></dict>
        <key>Wes Janson</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1014.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wes Janson (pronounced /Wěs Jǎn'-sǔn/) was an ace starfighter pilot of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and New Republic. Janson first joined the Alliance prior to the Battle of Yavin, but contracted an illness that prevented him from flying in that engagement. He later served with Rogue Squadron, the Rebellion's most elite starfighter squadron. As a key member of the Rogues, he fought at the battles of Hoth and Endor, among others. After Endor, Janson flew in multiple engagements as part of Rogue Squadron, including covering the defection of Imperial Grand Vizier Sate Pestage. Following that mission, Rogue Squadron was temporarily disbanded and Janson, along with his good friend Derek Klivian, were assigned to train new pilots. He would later go on to serve with Wraith Squadron, the New Republic's pilot/commando unit. Janson was the first executive officer of the squadron and saw action both in space and on the ground during commando missions against Warlord Zsinj. After Zsinj was defeated, Janson transferred back to Rogue Squadron. Janson eventually reached the rank of Major after years of service fighting against the Galactic Empire, including in campaigns against Prince-Admiral Delak Krennel and Grand Admiral Thrawn, as well as a diplomatic mission to Adumar.
            Janson retired from active service after the end of the Galactic Civil War, but returned to serve the New Republic by leading a group of volunteers during the Yuuzhan Vong War. The Yellow Aces were heavily involved at the Battle of Borleias, garnering a reputation as an elite unit. After the Yuuzhan Vong surrender, Janson retired again, but peace was fleeting. He would once again return to combat in the Second Galactic Civil War, joining Rakehell Squadron in support of Luke Skywalker's insurgency against Jacen Solo, who had fallen to the dark side. Janson flew in the Battle of Centerpoint, providing cover for Jedi infiltration teams.
            Wes Janson, a native of Taanab, originally joined the Rebel Alliance as a member of the Tierfon Yellow Aces, a BTL Y-wing starfighter training squadron during the early years of the Galactic Civil War. The group was based out of the Tierfon Rebel Base. The aim of the Yellow Aces was to engage pilots in technically "active" missions, but to avoid pitting them against too hazardous of a situation in preparation for more dangerous duties in the future.[6]
            As a member of the Yellow Aces, Janson racked up an impressive kill record and earned a tremendous reputation. However, it was on one of his first missions with them that Janson was faced with a difficult decision. The Yellow Aces were tasked with ambushing an Imperial convoy carrying supplies that the Alliance needed badly. When the convoy arrived at their destination, its armed escort was larger than anticipated. One pilot, Kissek Doran, was suddenly struck with panic and tried to leave the group. With the prospect of compromising the entire ambush party if he was detected by the Imperials, Janson and Jek Tono Porkins were ordered to bring him back. Since using his ion cannon would give away their position, Janson was forced to use his lasers, destroying the fleeing pilot—it was his first kill.[7]
            Nevertheless, Janson's service with the Yellow Aces was considered exemplary. He was quickly promoted to Lieutenant and was awarded the rank of True Gunner for "consistent excellence and superior performance as an officer and a gunner," according to General Jan Dodonna at a Tierfon Fighter Base awards ceremony.[6] While with the Yellow Aces, Janson formed a strong friendship with Porkins, nicknamed "Piggy." Coming out of the same training class, they quickly bonded. Janson would often recall some rather tall tales of their days together at Tierfon.[6] He also met Tomer Darpen in the squadron, whom he would later encounter on Adumar.[8]
            With the destruction of Alderaan and the threat of the Death Star, the Yellow Aces were placed on "full active" duty. An emergency list was compiled of pilots who would be transferred to Yavin Base. Wes Janson was on that list. However, at the time of the transfer, Janson was stricken with Hesken Fever, having contracted it while on a scouting mission, and was unable to go. Even though the ailing Janson firmly insisted on his ability to fly, a replacement was named to fill his slot on the transfer list. That someone was Jek Porkins. Porkins never returned from the assault on the Death Star, and Janson often blamed himself for the death of his friend. From that point forward, he vowed to fly to honor his fallen friend. Future heroics would help alleviate some of the guilt and pain he carried with him.[2][6]
            Wes Janson was among the first crop of pilots to join the new Rogue Squadron under the command of Rebel pilot and aspiring Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker after the destruction of the Death Star. With the Rogues, Janson was permanently assigned to the roving Alliance High Command group. He performed well in several skirmishes during the Thila evacuation, helping Rogue Group prove their worth. Six months after Yavin, he participated in the campaign against Moff Kohl Seerdon, including action at the Raid on Balmorra, where he helped to cripple the Empire's production of AT-AT walkers for some time; and the Second Battle of Thyferra, which saw the death of Seerdon.[6][9]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wes_Janson/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWesJanson</string></dict>

            Jav Mefran served as a wilderness fighter specialist with the 4th SpecForce Regiment of the Alliance Special Forces. When the Rebel Alliance relocated from Dantooine to Yavin 4, Mefran assisted in clearing out the jungle brush which surrounded the Great Temple.[1]
            As a corporal, Mefran became a member of the Rogue One squad, and fought at the Battle of Scarif.[2] Although he had misgivings about the mission, Mefran masked them by focusing on the beautiful tropical environment of Scarif, having an affinity for rainforest surroundings.[1] As the fighting progressed from landing pad nine, Corporal Mefran remained with the Zeta-class cargo shuttle SW-0608 alongside Corporal Stordan Tonc and other Pathfinders. Initially hiding from Imperial reinforcements, he helped defend the vessel when the Empire came to investigate, and exchanged blaster fire with enemy troops outside the shuttle. However, although Bodhi Rook was able to open communications with the Alliance Fleet above the planet, Mefran was shot by Imperial forces.[2]
            Gruff and grizzled, Jav Mefran served as a wilderness fighter specialist. He had an affinity for rainforest surroundings, and enjoyed focusing on the beauty of his environment as a means of masking any misgivings about a current mission or operation.[1]

        <key>Darth Jadus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1020.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Jadus was a male Human Dark Lord of the Sith of the resurgent Sith Empire and a member of the Emperor's Dark Council. Speculated to be second in power to only the Emperor himself by Imperial Intelligence, Jadus asserted his influence over the Imperial Intelligence network, controlling it through various liaisons. Darth Jadus was against the anti-alien policies of the Empire and allowed aliens into Imperial Intelligence.
            In 3643 BBY a new terrorist organization emerged in the Empire, the Eagle terrorist network, which simultaneously launched an attack to the Kaas City generators, failing only thanks to the efforts of a recruit of the Intelligence, and bombed the Dominator, killing the thousands of Imperial dignitaries aboard for a planned cruise across the Empire. Jadus was onboard and thus presumed dead, leading the Dark Council elected his daughter Darth Zhorrid as his replacement. Zhorrid ordered Intelligence to use all its resources to find the terrorist leader Eagle and provide her with her revenge.
            Imperial Intelligence, thanks to the agent now codenamed Cipher Nine, disassembled the Eagle's entire network and in the end found and killed the Eagle himself, who was attempting to use experimental Imperial weapons known as the Eradicators to launch a devastating attack on Imperial holdings. Before dying, however, the Eagle revealed that he had a mysterious patron.
            It was later discovered that Darth Jadus had faked his own death and saved the remains of the Dominator through the Force, all the while as shvash gas destroyed the rest, and that he was the real leader of the Eagle; he was ultimately bested by Cipher Nine, but his final fate remains undisclosed. One theory is that Jadus was imprisoned or exiled and removed from the Dark Council.[4] Another possibility is that Cipher Nine ends up joining Jadus, acting as his hand to reform Imperial Intelligence from within.
            Either way, Lord Jadus was known to have learned of the Emperor's plans to wipe all life from the galaxy, and left the reaches of the known galaxy in order to later return and enact his plans. If Cipher Nine joined with him, he will tell the Agent of this through one of his operatives that he intends to leave the known galaxy and leaves control of Imperial Intelligence in their hands.
            Darth Jadus was listed as a potential suspect in the attempted assassination of the Alliance Commander on Iokath by Lana Beniko confirming that Jadus was alive.
            A prominent yet enigmatic figure among the Sith, Darth Jadus was known for showing more self-restraint than his fellow Lords, rarely succumbing to the passions and emotions that powered the dark side of the Force. His personal motives and passions were unclear to all; he showed very little interest in concerning himself with the squabbles and power struggles so common among his people, instead focusing his influence on the Imperial Intelligence network. His enigmatic nature, coupled with his tendency to use outsiders and non-Force sensitives rather than other Sith as his favored agents, fostered a sense of unease and distrust among his peers and an almost religious fervour among his servants.[1]
            It was suggested by Imperial Intelligence employees that Darth Jadus' powers were second only to the Emperor himself. Indeed, those unfortunate enough to find themselves in his presence experienced a physical sensation of pain and suffering due to the dark side radiating from him.
            As a Dark Council member, Darth Jadus was immensely powerful with the dark side of the Force capable of force stealth, force choke, force lightning, and healing with the dark side. Darth Jadus was also talented with his single-bladed sith lightsaber.
            Jadus' power was acknowledged by the Emperor himself, who—in a conversation with Cipher 9—declared Jadus to be the best Sith his Empire ever produced.
            Darth Jadus was first identified in an in-universe Holonet entry on the website for BioWare's video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. Included in this entry are Aurebesh phrases such as "Herald of a New Era," "Daughter is only known apprentice," and "Who is the hand of Jadus".
            There are four alternate options to Jadus' fate: in the light side option, Cipher Nine can decide to stop the Eradicators, fight Jadus but let him escape in the end, or bargain with him before letting him go into exile and deactivate the Eradicators; in the dark side, Cipher Nine chooses to attack and arrest Jadus, thus sealing the fate of countless lives on Dromund Kaas; in another dark side option, Cipher Nine can join Jadus, earning the title "Hand of Jadus" and let him reform Intelligence to his own use. If Cipher Nine chooses to serve Jadus, during the class mission on Hoth, the agent runs into one of Jadus' servants, who assigns the agent to survey a detachment of Imperial Guardsmen on the planet. Once the mission is complete, the servant cryptically claims that Jadus has a better grasp of the Sith Emperor's plans.
            Following the conclusion of Chapter 2 of the Imperial Agent story, Jadus tells Cipher Nine that he's removing himself from the war to concentrate on other plans, leaving Nine to carry out his work. He also sanctions the Minister of Intelligence's request for Nine to hunt down and destroy the Star Cabal.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Jadus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthJadus</string></dict>

        <key>Jeken</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1023.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jeken was a male human who enlisted as a cadet in the Imperial Academy, the military training program run by the Galactic Empire. His ambition was to join the ranks of the white-armored stormtroopers, whom he thought were inhrently superior to their clone predecessors.[1]
            At some point, Jeken, five other cadets, and a supervisor were dispatched to the planet Imvur. However, an explosion damaged most of their ship's vital systems, and they were forced to send a distress message. When someone finally came to the cadets' rescue, it turned out that their saviors were a band of rebels. Jeken saw that as an opportunity to capture the rebels and hand them over to the Empire, which would certainly impress the cadets' superiors.[1]
            However, a girl cadet named Reann Tomvig refused to harm those who had come to the cadets' help. When Jeken ordered Tomvig to stun the rebels with a blaster rifle, she refused, prompting the boy to call her weak. What Jeken had not foreseen, however, is that Tomvig would not simply disobey, but actively turn on him and use the blaster to neutralize him.

        <key>Jace Rucklin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1025.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jace Rucklin was a human male racer who lived during the era of the New Republic. Rucklin, who headed his own racing team, had coveted Jarek Yeager's hyperfuel for a long time, and saw Kazuda Xiono's arrival on the Colossus as an opportunity to acquire it. However, Rucklin's manipulation of Xiono to steal the fuel resulted in the loss of his racer, and thus all of the savings he had directed into it. Rucklin chose to ignore his own fault in the loss, and instead blamed Xiono, vowing to get back at him for it. After the loss of his racer, in order to earn the credits for a new one, Rucklin was forced to take a job working in Doza Tower, cleaning and serving food and drink to its residents.
            Jace Rucklin, by 34 ABY, was a racer who lived on the Colossus platform on Castilon, where he had his own racing team, consisting of himself, fellow human Lin Gaava and Sullustan Gorrak Wiles. Rucklin had aspirations of being one of the top racers, but instead of trying to work hard to get to that position, preferred to cut corners, steal and cheat wherever possible. One of the ways he did this was by having all "extraneous" systems, including safety systems, removed from his racer to make it fly faster. He and his team knew that Jarek Yeager, a former racer on the station who owned his own repair shop, likely owned a supply of powerful hyperfuel, and wished to get their hands on it by any means necessary.[1]
            Rucklin saw the arrival of Kazuda Xiono, the newest member of Yeager's Team Fireball, as the perfect opportunity to acquire the hyperfuel. Xiono had acquired a deserved reputation for being naïve soon after his arrival on the platform, and Rucklin knew that Xiono was unlikely to have heard anything about his reputation for being a lazy prankster. Thus, he and his team waited for an opportunity to approach Xiono. They found one in Xiono's early weeks on the platform, when he had come down to Aunt Z's Tavern due to experiencing frustration with the heavy workload Yeager had put him under. Unbeknownst to Rucklin and his friends, Xiono's frustration stemmed in part from the fact that he was actually a spy for the Resistance, and his job as a mechanic was merely a cover.[1]
            After a conversation in which Rucklin revealed Yeager's history as a racer to Xiono, Rucklin challenged Xiono to a friendly speeder bike race. Unbeknownst to Xiono, Rucklin had had Wiles sabotage the bike he was riding. This allowed Rucklin the opportunity to ingratiate himself with Xiono during the race by saving him from the "accident". Thus, when Xiono came by Rucklin's hangar later, he was able to use the incident as leverage to pressure Xiono into sneaking him into Yeager's private hangar to see Yeager's racer, intending to use the opportunity to try and steal Yeager's hyperfuel. When the two entered the shop, they had to avoid Yeager, his astromech droid R1-J5 "Bucket", and Xiono's coworker Tam Ryvora. They weren't caught, and Xiono told Rucklin they wouldn't be able to see the ship because the hangar door was locked. Rucklin stole a canister of hyperfuel behind Xiono's back, and quickly made his exit claiming that they would have to try another day.[1]
            Rucklin was signed up in a race for that day, and expected that with the hyperfuel he was bound to win it. When Xiono came by his hangar later, Rucklin and his team quickly blocked Xiono's view of the stolen hyperfuel and declined his offer of lunch. Rucklin, however, was unaware that more than a few drops of hyperfuel would turn a ship into a flying bomb, and thus added far too much while putting it in his racer. When Xiono learned of the theft and the danger, he realized that Rucklin was in trouble and rushed off to save his life. Rucklin's friends noticed something odd with the racer's engines when he started them, but they were interrupted by Xiono and BB-8 entering the hangar. Xiono jumped onto Rucklin's racer to get him to stop, and wound up ejecting the two of them. As the ejection seat's parachute had been removed, the two nearly fell into the ocean before being rescued by BB-8 and Yeager.[1]
            Rucklin, after being rescued, ignored his own fault in the loss of his ship and, angry about the loss of all the savings he had spent on it, chose to instead blame Xiono, claiming that no one would ever know he had stolen the hyperfuel. He did not know that Yeager was in earshot when he said that. Rucklin eventually vowed to get Xiono back for the incident before storming off with his teammates.[1]
            Due to the loss of his racer, Rucklin was forced to get a new job, working as a servant in Doza Tower and the Aces Lounge. There, he served drinks and cleaned for Captain Imanuel Doza and the members of the Ace Squadron. Rucklin encountered Xiono again when he was invited inside the tower by Torra Doza, who was lonely and looking for a friend to spend some time with. When Rucklin encountered Xiono, he reaffirmed his intent to get revenge on him for the loss of the racer, before Xiono and Torra left the lounge area. Rucklin later saw his chance when he witnessed Xiono sneaking into Doza's office. Xiono intended to download the contents of a datapad the First Order's Commander Pyre had given Doza with the details of the Order's proposal regarding Colossus security. Intent on getting revenge on Xiono, Rucklin interrupted Doza as he was seeing Pyre off the platform, which made Doza angry with him. After Pyre's departure, Doza finally heard Rucklin out about the intruder and, due to his own suspicions of Xiono, headed back to his office with Rucklin. Xiono was alerted to the threat of discovery by BB-8, and by the time Rucklin and Doza arrived at the office, had hidden in a closet near Doza's desk. Rucklin heard Xiono gasp in shock upon realizing Doza had an Imperial uniform stashed in the closet and attempted to open the door, but Doza prevented him, angrily stating that the closet's contents were private. Rucklin was sent off to dispose of the office's garbage. Torra's arrival in the office prevented Doza from looking in the closet himself, allowing Xiono to escape. Rucklin later accidentally saved Xiono's life when he and Torra were inside the trash incinerator, by throwing Doza's garbage in at just the right time for it to intercept one of the incinerator's blasts.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jace_Rucklin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJaceRucklin</string></dict>
        <key>Jonner Jin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1026.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jonner Jin was a human male member of Iron Squadron, a local rebel cell based on the planet Mykapo. In 2 BBY, Jonner and his fellow rebels were involved in a skirmish with an Imperial advance patrol. The Iron Squadron was assisted by the Spectres and the Phoenix Cell, who had come to evacuate civilians from Mykapo. While the Iron Squadron initially declined the Spectres' advice to leave the system before Imperial reinforcements arrived, Jonner along with Gooti Terez and R3-A3 saw reason and departed with them. However, their captain Mart Mattin stayed behind to fight the Imperials. Jonner, Gooti, R3-A3 and the Spectres later joined forces in a successful mission to rescue Mart. As a result, the Iron Squadron joined the rebellion.
            Jonner Jin joined the Iron Squadron during the Age of the Empire. The Iron Squadron was a local rebel cell based at Mykapo and consisted of the humans Mart Mattin, Mart's father, the Theelin Gooti Terez, and the astromech droid R3-A3. The Iron Squadron operated from a YT-2400 light freighter called the Sato's Hammer. After Mart's father died, Mart assumed leadership of the cell. Mart was not interested in the wider rebellion and did not keep in touch with his uncle Commander Jun Sato, the leader of the Phoenix Cell. The Iron Squadron harried Imperial forces in the system.[1]
            In 2 BBY, the Galactic Empire imposed martial law on Mykapo. The Iron Squadron clashed with an Imperial advance patrol. During the skirmish, the Iron Squadron's hyperdrive sustained damaged. Shortly later, the Spectres and Phoenix Squadron arrived to evacuate rebel sympathizers on Mykapo. The Spectres' ship Ghost managed to destroy the TIE fighters attacking Sato's Hammer. This enabled Iron Squadron to destroy the Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser with explosives. Following the skirmish, Mart invited the Spectres' leader Hera Syndulla and her crew to meet with the Iron Squadron.[1]
            Jonner and Gooti welcome Hera and her crew Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, and the astromech droid Chopper aboard their ship. When Sabine noted the rundown state of the freighter, Jonner replied that they did not need a hyperdrive. He led the Spectres to their captain Mart, who was waiting in the cockpit. Jonner sided with his captain Mart when the latter objected to Hera's advice that they leave the system before Imperial reinforcements arrive. He even mockingly asked what "evacuate" meat with Mark finishing off that it meant running away like a coward. He also expressed his unwillingness to listen to Hera's arguments. With the two sides unable to agree, Hera and her crew left the Sato's Hammer and returned to the Ghost. Ezra managed to convince Hera to let him, Sabine, and Chopper stay behind so that they could repair the Iron Squadron's hyperdrive as a means of winning them over. Hera agreed but warned them that they had to leave on the shuttle Phantom II at the first sign of Imperial activity.[1]
            Jonner and Gooti watched while R3-A3, Sabine, and Chopper repaired the hyperdrive. Mart thought it was a waste of time and returned to the cockpit. When Ezra advised Jonner and Gooti that they had to be ready to leave if they could not fix the hyperdrive, the two Iron Squadron members expressed an unwillingness to leave their captain and their home. Ezra then responded that they had to choose their battles carefully. R3, Sabine, and Chopper managed to repair the hyperdrive but their efforts came to naught when Mart redirected the power to the ship's laser cannons and deflector shields. Jonner and the other rebels quickly discovered that Imperial reinforcements under Admiral Kassius Konstantine had exited hyperspace. Upon seeing Konstantine's forces, Jonner and Gooti realized they were outgunned and outnumbered.[1]
            He and Gooti tried to reason with Mart but their captain was determined to fight the Empire. After the ship's power broke down, Mart ordered an evacuation. Jonner, Gooti, R3-A3, and the Spectres fled aboard the Phantom II but Mart changed his mind and decided to fight Konstantine's forces. Konstantine easily neutralized Mart's bombs and disabled the Sato's Hammer's engines. Jonner and the other rebels were forced to leave Mart behind and fled into hyperspace. After rendezvousing with the rebel fleet, Jonner attended a briefing with Hera, the Spectres, Commander Sato, and Captain Rex. Sato sanctioned a mission led by Hera to rescue Mart. Jonner and Gooti were overjoyed they were going back to rescue their captain.[1]
            During the rescue mission, Jonner and Gooti manned the cargo bay of the Ghost. They opened the cargo bay doors which allowed R3-A3 and Chopper to fly out on their rocket boosters and disable a magno-mine that had been planted on the Sato's Hammer. Under Hera's orders, they attached the Ghost to Sato's Hammer. After picking up Sato's Hammer, the rebels were reinforced by Commander Sato who had arrived with a CR90 corvette and several A-wings. Before escaping into hyperspace, the rebels dropped the magno-mine over Konstantine's light cruiser; badly damaging the Imperial ship. Jonner then watched as Grand Admiral Thrawn's Imperial Star Destrpyer Chimaera exited hyperspace. Jonner and his comrades realized the sheer size and power of an Imperial Star Destroyer and that it was folly to take on one alone.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jonner_Jin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJonnerJin</string></dict>

            Vikar Dorn served under the banner of the late Galactic Alliance, though he maintained his position during the rule of the Sith Empire, as the latter system needed the Alliance's bureaucracy to manage the galaxy following the Sith–Imperial War. Dorn's son was captain of the Pellaeon-class Star Destroyer Dauntless.
            In 137 ABY, Sith Lady Darth Maladi used him in an attempt to infiltrate Bastion and have Darth Kruhl kill Roan Fel using the defection of Governor Dorn and the entire crew of the Dauntless as bait.
            However, Kruhl's mission failed and the Sith Lord was killed by Roan Fel himself. With the treachery discovered, Emperor Fel had the entire crew of the Dauntless executed with only Governor Dorn being spared. He was dropped off in an escape pod close to Krayt-loyal ships and made his way back to Coruscant, carrying Kruhl's lightsaber with him. After revealing what happened to Lady Maladi and assuring her that he had not spoken to anyone else, he was killed by the Sith Lady herself.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vikar_Dorn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVikarDorn</string></dict>
        <key>Drake Lo'gaan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1029.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Drake Lo'gaan was a Human male Jedi Padawan during the Clone Wars. Apprenticed to Master Roron Corobb, Lo'gaan participated in the galaxy-wide conflict, but was separated from his master during the Battle of Coruscant. During the battle, Corobb was slain by General Grievous, leaving Lo'gaan without a master. Soon after, Anakin Skywalker sent Lo'gaan to Felucia to aid in the ongoing battle on that world. There, he met Ekria and Zonder, fellow masterless Padawans, and he witnessed the enactment of Order 66. Fleeing back to Coruscant with his new friends, he lived his life on the run from the Inquisitorius, particularly Antinnis Tremayne.
            The trio of Padawans eventually became freelance crime-fighters in Coruscant's underworld, and were involved in a Black Sun plot. Though they thought themselves safe at first, their dealings with Prince Xizor put them in grave danger, and resulted in the death of Zonder at the hands of Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith. Lo'gaan and Ekria sought revenge, and planned to assassinate Vader on Tepasi, but they had a contingency plan in place, in case the attempt failed. Lo'gaan unsuccessfully dueled with Vader, but survived the encounter thanks to trickery on Ekria's part, and the pair were able to live their lives in solitude, believed dead by the agents of the Galactic Empire.
            Accepted into the Jedi Temple and the Jedi Order as an infant, Drake Lo'gaan, as per normal protocol, was trained as a youngling in the hopes of becoming a Jedi Knight's Padawan. At the age of eleven, he fared well in the Jedi Temple Apprentice Tournament, garnering the notice of Jedi Master Roron Corobb. The Ithorian Master accepted Lo'gaan as his apprentice.[2][1]
            Together, Master and Padawan embarked on several missions during the galaxy-wide Clone Wars. During Corobb's final mission, however, the pair would be separated. The Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded Coruscant, with the intent of capturing Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Corobb was one of the Masters tasked with defending the Chancellor, while Lo'gaan was left to fight the invading armies. As the battle began to wind down, Lo'gaan, on a speeder bike, sped to the Chancellor's safe house and engaged a cadre of General Grievous's IG-100 MagnaGuards. While he was fighting them, however, a group of clone commandos under the command of Stass Allie dispatched the droids. Allie, one of the other Masters tasked with defending the Chancellor, had lost contact with Masters Corobb, Moudama, and Ti.[3]
            Waiting to gain entry to the safe house, the group heard a scream of anguish from within. Realizing that Grievous must be inside, the group hurriedly entered into the bunker, searching for the occupants. Meeting up with Mace Windu, they reached the main area of the bunker, only to find Shaak Ti incapacitated, with Masters Corobb and Moudama slain. Neither Grievous nor Palpatine were in sight. Lo'gaan, distraught, cradled the body of his dead master. Palpatine would eventually be rescued by Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the Confederacy forced to retreat.[3]
            As the Clone Wars continued to rage, Lo'gaan stayed at the Temple, masterless, but he resolved to personally hunt down and destroy Grievous. He met Skywalker in the Temple one day, and asked him if he could join in the hunt for Grievous on Utapau. Skywalker explained that Master Kenobi had been chosen to hunt the General instead, but the Hero With No Fear sympathized with Lo'gaan. Lo'gaan accompanied the Jedi Knight to the staging grounds, where Skywalker gave the Council's orders to Stass Allie. Allie was to deliver reinforcements to Felucia, where Shu Mai had released deadly toxins into the water supplies. Skywalker, making an executive decision, told Lo'gaan to go with Allie, and join the Felucia task force.[3]
            At Felucia, Lo'gaan met up with Masters Aayla Secura and Barriss Offee with the 327th Star Corps, as well as fellow Padawans Ekria and Zonder. The Padawans were tasked with securing a water supply station at Jiaozi, while the two masters dealt with the cities of Niango and Har Gau. Lo'gaan, showing initiative, devised a plan to lure away the Felucian resistance guarding the plant. The Selonian Zonder roared loudly, causing the Gossam and battle droid guards to attack. After a brief skirmish, Lo'gaan and the troops feigned a retreat, leading the enemy further into Felucia's jungles. They were able to reach the station before the planet wide toxins had reached it, allowing Ekria to halt the advance of the poisonous fumes. However, she was not able to access the other stations remotely.[3]
            While Ekria was still attempting to shut off the toxin flow, the Padawan's signal to the Masters was jammed. Ekria attempted to bring the first-person cameras built into the clone trooper helmets up on the station's viewscreen, but as she did, she detected a message from Coruscant, bearing Confederate encryption. As Ekria attempted to decrypt it, the Padawans witnessed the murder of the Masters on the viewscreen. Shocked and saddened, the Padawans sought an answer to the sudden reversal of the clone troopers' allegiance. Ekria finally decrypted the message: a hologram ordering Commander CC-5052 to "execute Order 66." Shortly thereafter, the Padawans received a top-priority message from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, telling them that the war was over, and that they were to return to the Jedi Temple.[3] Realizing that the clones were now on the hunt for Jedi, the Padawans were able to flee Felucia and return to Coruscant undetected.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Drake_Lo%27gaan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDrakeLo'gaan</string></dict>

He later became an informant for the Rebel Alliance. Around 0 ABY he established himself in the upper echelons of society on the planet Salliche and passed along sensitive information to the Rebels.
            Following in the footsteps of his forefathers, Geen served during the Clone Wars as the commanding officer of Rom Mohc. After the war, Geen retired to the planet Salliche, where he became involved in the planet's bureaucracy. He cultivated contacts among Salliche's senators and bureaucrats, Imperial naval officers, and acquaintances from the Clone Wars. As a war hero he was invited to high-level receptions on Salliche where he would entertain by telling exaggerated stories from the Clone Wars.[1]
            He spent his time between his estate on Salliche and various plazas and forums in the capital city, Netassa where he would argue politics with legislators and entertain younger generations with his war stories.[1]
            Geen was a Human male. By 0 ABY he was mostly bald but had a tidy beard and he was hunched over. He was known as an entertaining storyteller, often telling stories of the ancient wars whenever possible. He was also a good listener and gleaned information from his contacts, which he passed on to the Rebellion through encrypted communications to sympathizers. He was generally contacted through Imperial NetPost, and contacts seeking him would claim to be relatives of "old war friends."[1]
            In his youth Geen was skilled at combat and was a solid commander. In his later years he became very involved with local government and bureaucracy and could move skillfully around upper echelons of society.[1]

        <key>Zherron</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1033.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zherron was a Human male and the captain of the Khoonda Militia on Dantooine 3951 BBY. A man of straightforward speech and direct action, Zherron did not believe in wasting time or words. Along with Terena Adare, he was considered to be one of the key people holding the Khoonda settlement together.
            A no-nonsense leader, Zherron's aggressive attitude towards Dantooine's mercenaries prompted many, including his own lieutenant Berun Modrul, to raise doubts as to whether he was intentionally provoking them. At the same time, Zherron's commitment to the Khoonda government and Terena Adare, whose goal was peace for the settlers, caused others to believe he was not doing enough about them. Unbeknownst to all but a few, Zherron had planted cameras in a set of atmospheric sensors left for the mercenaries to steal, and was planning on spying on them. He was also working with the mercenary Dopak, although the nature of their partnership is unknown. Zherron believed that the mercenaries were extremely dangerous, and it was necessary to do anything to stop them. He considered those like Berun who wanted to appease them to be living in a sheltered world.
            Zherron and the militia were also constantly occupied with managing Dantooine's large salvager population. Swindling of the settlers, dangerous criminals like Gerevick, and competing claims to caches of salvage were consistently amongst the many problems the militia dealt with, causing Zherron to adopt an attitude of weary resignation regarding salvager business.
            As it turned out, Zherron was proven right about the mercenaries when Azkul revealed his plans to attack Khoonda. Berun and any other detractors quickly withdrew their complaints, and with the help of Meetra Surik, Zherron prepared the militia for the attack. Not a particularly inspirational speaker, Zherron let Surik motivate his troops with a rousing speech. When the Battle of Khoonda began, Zherron's men performed admirably, driving back the mercenaries and killing Azkul.
            When the Telos Security Force put out a call for help during the Battle of Telos IV, Zherron brought a small contingent of militiamen from Dantooine to aid them (possibly supplemented with Dopak and his mercenaries). On Citadel Station, he led the attack to punch a hole in the Sith barricade.
            It is possible for the player to reveal that Zherron is spying on the mercenaries to Terena Adare, causing him to be removed from his post and Berun Modrul to take his place. However, Zherron is reinstated when the mercenaries reveal their plans for attack.
            If the player chooses the dark side path and allies with Azkul, Zherron is killed defending Khoonda.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zherron</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZherron</string></dict>

            In the early days of the Resistance, Ematt served as an agent for Organa by continuing his service in the New Republic military whilst seeking potential converts for the Resistance. After the defection of too many New Republic pilots to go unnoticed, Ematt left his post in the Republic to fully join the Resistance.[2]
            Sometime after, he escorted General Organa to the Mirrin Prime Republic Base to see the recruitment of Commander Poe Dameron, fresh from a skirmish with the First Order. Ematt intercepted the young pilot as he landed with two shore police, and brought him to the General.[9]
            Following the Battle of Starkiller Base, Ematt was promoted from major to general.[10] During the Battle of Crait, Ematt observed the All Terrain MegaCaliber Sixes en route to Crait outpost, and was situated near a trench while his men took positions.[11]
            Caluan Ematt was a human male with brown hair and eyes.[1]
            Caluan Ematt first appeared in the simultaneous release of Smuggler's Run: A Han Solo &amp; Chewbacca Adventure and Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure on Force Friday in 2015, identified only as "Ematt." Later that September, Nestlé released Smuggler's Run, an animated adaptation of the novel, in which Ematt's first name is identified as "Caluan." Jordan D. White, an editor for the Star Wars comics at Marvel who worked on the video, confirmed the spelling on Twitter. He was portrayed by Andrew Jack in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens and Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Caluan_Ematt</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCaluanEmatt</string></dict>
        <key>Jorus C'baoth</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1035.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jorus C'baoth was a male Human from the planet of Bortras who served in the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Republic Classic era. Like fellow Jedi Master Dooku, C'baoth was arrogantly sure of his own skills and talents, believed himself to be a peerless warrior and philosopher, and viewed non-Force sensitives as inferior. A controversial figure among his own peers, C'baoth was regarded as the epitome of a Jedi Master by some, while others were distrustful of him.
            During his exemplary, if unorthodox, career, C'baoth settled a number of conflicts. He notably participated in the demobilization of Ando, defeated a band of Dark Jedi in the Elrood sector, put an end to the Ascendancy Contention of Alderaan, and helped his colleague Tra's M'ins mediate the Duinuogwuin–Gotal conflict. Above all that, he also found time to train a Padawan, the young Human female Lorana Jinzler.
            He was the main proponent of the Outbound Flight project, which he envisioned as being the precursor to the discovery of unknown species who could be taught the ways of the Jedi. However, C'baoth, like Outbound Flight, was ultimately doomed by his arrogance and events outside of his control. With the failure of his vision and the destruction of Outbound Flight at the hands of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force led by Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo, also known as Thrawn, C'baoth eventually fell to the dark side of the Force when he submitted to his anger and attempted to kill Thrawn. He himself died when a Chiss radiation bomb exploded inside of the expedition's main starship, the Outbound Flight.
            Darth Sidious, the Sith alter-ego of the authoritarian politician Palpatine, would later use recovered samples of C'baoth's DNA as the template for the insane clone named Joruus C'baoth. That clone became the guardian of Emperor Palpatine's private treasury, and later worked with Grand Admiral Thrawn during his campaign against the New Republic.
            A Human male, Jorus C'baoth hailed from the city of Reithcas, capital of the bountiful planet Bortras, in the last century of the Galactic Republic. From the time of his birth[5] in 135 BBY,[2] it was evident that the infant C'baoth was keenly attuned to the Force,[5] a mystical energy field that bound the galaxy together.[6] Eventually, his untrained potential drew the attention of the Jedi Order,[5] a group of warriors and philosophers who had been the guardians of peace and justice from the early beginnings of the Republic.[6] As was traditional among the Jedi,[7] C'baoth was claimed from his birth parents and brought to the Jedi Temple on the ecumenopolis of Coruscant, fountainhead of the Republic and headquarters of the Jedi. In the Temple, C'baoth joined the other Jedi Initiates, and the members of the Order became his only family.[5]
            In 128 BBY, at the age of seventeen,[1] C'baoth added to his Jedi studies with an education from Mirnic University.[8] Upon his graduation, he traveled to the Jedi Training Center on Kamparas,[1] home to many Jedi scholars,[9] to continue his instruction in the demanding ways of the Force. After training on Kamparas for two years, he was taken on as a private student.[1] C’baoth's early life was an exception to the rule among Jedi of that time: in principle, Initiates who were not selected to be Padawans by the age of thirteen were shifted into one of the divisions of the Jedi Service Corps.[10]
            In 117 BBY, C'baoth joined the ranks of the Jedi Knights,[1] whose numbers formed the backbone of the Order.[11] He decided to follow the path of the Jedi Consulars, who chose to perfect the art of diplomacy and meditation over physical combat.[12] The knighted Jorus C'baoth became a firm supporter of the Galactic Republic, and served it well in a number of ways, most notably as a negotiator and mediator for many of the galaxy's racially-charged conflicts. He notably served as part of the Demilitarization Observation Group stationed on the oceanic planet of Ando, where the native Aqualish subspecies endlessly feuded with each other over mineral rights. A primary observer within the group, the Jedi from Bortras encountered another member of the task force, the ambitious Senator Palpatine of the Chommell sector. The two got along, and when they returned to Coruscant, C'baoth and Palpatine established a long-standing friendship that helped shape the development of C'baoth's career.[13]
            A few years after the events on Ando, the Council of Reassignment appointed Jorus C'baoth as Palpatine's personal adviser on Jedi-related matters. During his tenure as a member of the senator's staff, the Jedi discussed the Extragalactic Society, often referred to as ExGal, a community of scientists devoted to the search for life outside the galaxy. The two friends shared a mutual interest for the ExGal's ambitious project. However, a couple of years before the Battle of Naboo[13] in 32 BBY, C'baoth received visions of the dark side of the Force growing stronger. Intent on searching for the sources of his premonitions, the Jedi from Bortras chose to leave the service of Palpatine. He was reassigned once again and began his inquiries, which led him to the Elrood sector, in the Outer Rim. In that remote area of the galaxy, C'baoth discovered a group of marauding Dark Jedi who brought terror to the sector. With the help of a small strike team of fellow Knights, C'baoth vanquished the rogue Force-users.[13] Unbeknownst to him, his old friend Palpatine himself was a powerful darksider, a Dark Lord of the Sith known as Darth Sidious.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jorus_C%27baoth</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJorusC'baoth</string></dict>

        <key>Ven Zallow</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1037.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ven Zallow was a human male member of the Jedi Order by 3653 BBY, during the Great Galactic War. When a pair of intruders—Darth Malgus and Eleena Daru—entered the Jedi Temple on the Republic capital of Coruscant, Zallow, accompanied by his colleagues, was quick to confront the two. Before anything could be done, a captured Republic shuttle full of Sith warriors and Sith Inquisitors crashed through the Temple's main entrance. Its passengers quickly disembarked, immediately attacking the group of Jedi. Zallow fought against Malgus in a display of Force powers and lightsaber skills, but he was soon impaled by the Sith Lord, killed as the reconstituted Sith Empire's assault on Coruscant began.
            Ven Zallow was a human male Jedi Master alive during the Great Galactic War,[2] a conflict begun in 3681 BBY when the forgotten Sith Empire emerged from hiding to combat the Galactic Republic.[3] It was around this time that Zallow trained his apprentice, Aryn Leneer, to Knighthood; when she reached the rank, Zallow gave her a Nautolan tranquillity bracelet.[2] In 3653 BBY, twenty-eight years after the war's beginning, the Sith forces contacted the Republic with their wish to negotiate an end to the conflict. The Jedi Order, sworn defenders of the Republic, were skeptical of the Sith's intentions, but they realized that they had little chance of winning the war and decided to see if peace was really possible.[3] Leneer had been selected as one of the Republic's delegates to the peace conference on the Core World of Alderaan, and Zallow saw her off as she departed Coruscant, capital planet of the Republic. Unknown to the Republic, the Sith planned to use the talks as a diversion as their forces moved in on the Republic capital.[2]
            Zallow was present at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant when Darth Malgus and his lover, Eleena Daru—members of a Sith advance force in preparation for their attack—proceeded to kill a squad of Temple security guards that were trying to bar them from entering the Temple. As the pair of intruders strode in, Zallow—accompanied by his lightsaber-wielding allies, who had taken up positions flanking him on numerous levels—positioned himself in front of Malgus without a word, his eyes locked on Malgus's. Before either opponent could act, a captured Republic shuttle crashed through the Temple's main entrance, damaging the surrounding area and skidding to a stop behind Malgus. The Jedi held their ground for a moment as the shuttle came to a halt. The shuttle's hatch opened, revealing a strike force of at least twenty-five Sith warriors who ignited their lightsabers and engaged the assembled Jedi and members of Temple Security in a pitched battle.[2]
            After immobilizing the Twi'lek by throwing her against a stone pillar, Zallow was alerted[1] by his droid companion, the astromech droid T7-O1,[4] to an impending strike from Malgus. He and the Sith Lord engaged in combat, and the Jedi held his own against his opponent. He was knocked back by a roundhouse kick, using the opportunity to strike at a pair of Sith before leaping into the air as Malgus threw his lightsaber at his adversary, narrowly missing the blade. However, while he was still airborne, Malgus Force pushed him through a mound of rubble.[1]
            Malgus pulled his lightsaber back to his hand as he Force jumped over the rubble and, bringing his weapon in a killing strike, drove it into the floor where Zallow had been only a moment earlier. The Jedi, however, had evaded the strike and once again engaged Malgus in blade-to-blade combat, even landing a blow to his enemy's face with the hilt of his lightsaber. Ultimately, he was no match for Malgus, opening himself up to a fatal thrust through his abdomen. As he lay dying, the Sith Lord told him how the Jedi Order had been deceived, and that the Republic would fall as a result. Zallow's last sight was that of the Temple Precinct in flames, with scores of Sith starfighters, warships, and ground forces continuing the attack on the capital world,[1] a battle that would culminate with the death of the Republic's Supreme Chancellor and the destruction of the Temple itself.[5] Malgus saw to it that the Temple served as Zallow's and the others' final resting place.[2]
            On Alderaan, Leneer felt Zallow's death and immediately realized that the negotiations had been a ruse. When the talks concluded, she reflected on Zallow's passing and vowed to face her Master's killer.[2]
            Ven Zallow was a wise, composed Jedi Master whose presence in the Force greatly comforted his onetime apprentice, Aryn Leneer.[2] When Darth Malgus and Eleena Daru breached the Temple's defenses, Zallow led his comrades in confronting the two in a standoff. Even as the captured Republic shuttle crashed through the building's main entrance, the Jedi stood his ground while his companions took a few steps back. When the Sith emerged from the craft, Zallow joined his allies in defending the Temple, soon rushing to combat Malgus in an ultimately fruitless attempt.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ven_Zallow</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVenZallow</string></dict>

        <key>Tau  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1039.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Xesh was a Force-sensitive Human male who was captured and enslaved as a child by the Infinite Empire of the Rakata species. Branded with the Aurebesh letter Xesh on his face, back, and arms, Xesh was trained in the dark side of the Force as a Force Hound, the personal warrior of the Rakatan Predor Tul'kar. However, he gave himself a new name, Tau, which meant "soul" in his native language, and kept it a secret to all except Shae Koda. Powerful and skilled, Xesh excelled as a warrior, though his friendship with a fellow slave named Trill became a bitter rivalry when the two became Force Hounds. In Tul'kar's service, Xesh discovered many planets with strong Force signatures, and was considered to be one of the best Force Hounds in the entire Empire by the year 25,793 BBY, when he was tasked with finding a Force-strong planet in the Deep Core.
            Xesh was successful in finding a path to the world, which was the planet Tython, but Tul'kar's starship Devourer exploded over Tython and Xesh found himself the only survivor—only to be confronted by Shae Koda, Tasha Ryo, and Sek'nos Rath: three young Je'daii Journeyers, members of an order of Force-sensitive warriors, scholars, and healers. Believing the Je'daii to be warriors like himself, Xesh fought them before fleeing into the canyon known as the Rift. However, Xesh's arrival on Tython caused a powerful Force storm that began to sweep across the planet, leading the Je'daii to pursue the dark stranger into the Rift. After witnessing Shae Koda's use of the light side of the Force in defense of her friends, a power that was alien and intoxicating to Xesh, the Force Hound joined the Je'daii in battling a saarl, an enormous creature in the Rift.
            Defeated by the Je'daii, Xesh was exiled to the moon of Bogan to meditate on the Force, but his fellow exile, the mad Je'daii Daegen Lok, recruited Xesh in his mission to construct new Forcesabers—the powerful weapons of the Force Hounds. The two escaped Bogan and traveled the Settled Worlds of the Tython system, acquiring the materials needed for the Forcesabers, but Xesh grew more and more uneasy about his "ally" as their journey continued and as they were pursued by Je'daii, among them Shae Koda and Sek'nos Rath. Xesh captured Koda after rescuing her from death on the planet Nox, but Lok's attempt to secure the allegiance of the Twi'lek warlord Volnos Ryo ended in disaster as Ryo turned on Lok and their Je'daii pursuers caught up to them. Convinced by Koda to make his destiny his own, Xesh turned on Lok and helped the Je'daii capture the mad warrior.
            A Human male slave of the Infinite Empire of the Rakata species,[2] Xesh was found to be Force-sensitive and placed in a brood of other Force-sensitive children.,[4] Branded with a tattoo of the Aurebesh letter Xesh on his face, upper arms, and back,[5] the boy found a friend in a fellow slave named Trill, and she defended him against the brood leader Yirt when the larger child attempted to attack him. While the rest of the slaves turned on and began to attack Yirt, Trill and Xesh left Yirt at the other slaves' mercy. The two became friends and made blood oaths to protect and not to kill each other.[6]
            In the years that followed, Xesh and the rest of the brood were encased in the machines of the Rakata, which drew on their strength in the Force to fuel the Rakata's ships. It was then that he first touched the dark side of the Force, his powers unknowingly fueled by the pain, anger, and hate that he felt.[4] These machines and the pain that they caused also effectively stripped Xesh of his empathy, leaving him unable to experience emotions such as love or compassion.[7] One of the Rakata, a Predor named Tul'kar sensed Xesh's power and singled him out from the brood, training him as a Force Hound. Not long afterwards, Tul'kar forced him to fight Trill, who was also training as a Force Hound, and the two battled aboard Tul'kar's ship Devourer. Xesh was victorious in their battle, and he was ordered by Tul'kar to strike down Trill with his new Forcesaber. However, in an effort to save Trill's life, Xesh proposed that Tul'kar present Trill as a gift to his superior, Skal'nas, as a gift—but also an insult, as Trill would be less powerful than Xesh. Applauding his slave's cunning, Tul'kar agreed, and Xesh departed the chamber without responding to Trill's calling his name. Trill perceived Xesh's actions as a betrayal, and Xesh earned her undying hatred after their battle.[4]
            During his training on the planet Byss, Xesh was pitted against Isk, a Force Hound belonging to Tul'kar's superior Skal'nas, and Xesh was initially on the defensive against Isk, who was rumored to be Skal'nas's best Force Hound. However, when Isk attempted to use a set of darts against Xesh, the Human picked the darts out of the air as they passed before leaping on the offensive. Xesh was victorious in the battle, but refused to kill the defeated Isk when he begged for mercy and a good death in battle.[5]
            As Tul'kar's Hound, Xesh lived a life of loneliness, becoming the best Force Hound in the entire Infinite Empire.[4] Garbed in black and grey armor, Xesh sought out planets with powerful Force signatures, after which the Rakata would conquer the planets and cull the Force-sensitives from the native population.[1] Among Xesh's discoveries was the planet Sriluur, which was inhabited by the Weequay species.[4] Xesh led the Flesh Raiders, mutated lower-caste Rakata who were bred as soldiers for the Empire, in many battles, including one where they conquered the Givin species.[8] In 25,793 BBY, Xesh located the planet of Tatooine, and he led Tul'kar's forces there to conquer it and the native Kumumgah. Xesh then identified the Force-sensitive Kumumgah from the population, though his selection of a Kumumgah named Lonai caused Lonai's father to try and attack Tul'kar.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Xesh_(Force_Hound)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascTau</string></dict>
        <key>Zellos</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1040.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zellos was a Human male who served as a Grand Moff of the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Old Republic. Zellos commanded the second Imperial invasion of the Mid Rim planet Bothawui, an operation that became a drawn-out ground assault against a guerrilla force of Republic soldiers and Jedi Knights led by the Jedi Master Belth Allusis.
            Despite impressive Imperial advantages, Bothawui's Republic defenders inflicted considerable damage to the Imperial strike force. Zellos's men eventually defeated the majority of the Republic forces, prompting the Grand Moff to offer Allusis survival in exchange for his surrender. The Jedi refused, and Allusis and his forces were massacred, but not before they killed a majority of Zellos's forces. The Battle of Bothawui became a tremendous embarrassment for Zellos, who was not heard from again after returning to the Empire.
            The Human male Zellos lived during the Great Galactic War between the Old Republic and the revitalized Sith Empire, serving as an Imperial Grand Moff. In the initial stages of the war, the Sith Emperor had targeted the Outer Rim Territories in a widely successful campaign. After the Imperial capture of the Seswenna sector, the Emperor turned his sights toward the Mid Rim. The first planned target was the Bothan sector; however, the first Imperial invasion of Bothan Space met with disaster, as the Republic had anticipated the move and stationed its entire fleet over Bothawui itself.[1]
            This first major Republic victory provoked the Empire to attempt to redeem its losses by mounting a second campaign to take the planet, with Grand Moff Zellos commanding the assault. With Imperial warships from across the galaxy at his command, the Grand Moff led the second invasion of Bothan Space, this time intending to bombard Bothawui from orbit. The Sith vessels were unable to do so, however, as a powerful planetary shield protected Bothawui's surface. Zellos's forces—a fifty thousand-strong Imperial army—instead landed on the planet to engage the Republic defenders and destroy the shield generator. The small Republic force of Jedi and soldiers that remained after the first battle at Bothawui was led by Jedi Master Belth Allusis,[1] a leading member of the Jedi High Council[2] who developed new tactics and battle plans to combat the Imperials in the Bothan forests.[1]
            Zellos and his advisors believed the battle would be a swift victory for the Empire, and so they sent their troops into battle in direct assaults. This proved to be detrimental to the Imperial forces, as Allusis's tactics and determination allowed the Jedi and his men to repel the Imperial soldier. For every Republic trooper killed, the Empire lost ten. Zellos was eventually forced to call in reinforcements that overwhelmed the Republic defenders, who rallied to Allusis for one final stand. However, before allowing his men to finish them off, Zellos extended an offer of peace to Allusis. The Grand Moff promised to spare the Jedi Master's life if he surrendered, but Allusis refused the offer, and he and his men fought to the death. Before falling, the Republic forces inflicted enough damage on the Imperial army to drive them off Bothawui.[1] Zellos's invasion was unsuccessful and served as a major morale boost for the exhausted Republic.[3] The Grand Moff's failure on Bothawui later became the focus of a holorecord created by the Kel Dor Jedi Master Gnost-Dural in the aftermath of the end of the war.[1] The record was submitted to the Jedi Archives on Tython alongside a journal kept by Master Dural during the Great War. The journal also made mention of Moff Zellos and postulated that the Imperial commander would not be seen again after being punished by his Sith superiors.[2]
            Grand Moff Zellos was a little-known[2] but high-ranking official within the Sith Empire and took part in the Imperial conquest of the galaxy. As the commanding officer during the Battle of Bothawui, Zellos hoped to use his overwhelming numbers to crush the Republic resistance on the planet. However, he and his fellow commanders overestimated their advantage and used simple, straightforward assaults during the battle. This overconfidence was detrimental to their efforts, pushing Zellos to seek reinforcements. When he finally had Allusis and his defenders at his mercy, Zellos offered the Jedi Master peace in exchange for surrender. After his offer was refused, Zellos allowed his forces to kill Allusis and the rest of the Republic troops, inadvertently martyring Bothawui's defenders.[1][3]
            Grand Moff Zellos was introduced in the fifth installment of the Galactic Timeline, an in-universe account of the events leading up to the LucasArts/BioWare massively multiplayer online video game titled Star Wars: The Old Republic. The timeline is narrated by Kel-Dor Jedi Master Gnost-Dural, whose voice is provided by actor Lance Henriksen.[4] Zellos is again mentioned and pictured in The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural, a book which was included with collector's editions of Star Wars: The Old Republic.[5] The game and the journal were released on December 20, 2011. The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural consistently misspells Zellos's name as "Zelos."[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zellos</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZellos</string></dict>

        <key>Dalven Kyrell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1042.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dalven Kyrell, call sign HJ-290, was a human male second-wave aristocrat from the Outer Rim planet Jelucan. He was the older brother of Thane Kyrell, both of whom attended different Imperial Academies and later served in the Imperial Navy. The two had a difficult relationship during their childhood with Dalven bullying his younger brother. Despite his father Oris Kyrell's best efforts to secure his eldest son a place at the Imperial Academy, Dalven graduated as a a low-ranking clerical officer in the Imperial Navy.
            By contrast, his younger brother Thane became an elite TIE fighter pilot in the Navy before defecting to the Rebel Alliance. In the months following the Battle of Jakku, he served as a lieutenant under the leadership of Commander Nash Windrider. Kyrell's assignments were considered to be tedious and unskilled by his commanding officer.
            Dalven Kyrell was the eldest son of Oris Kyrell and Ganaire Kyrell. He had a younger brother named Thane Kyrell, whom he frequently bullied. His family were Second-wavers, the descendants of a group of affluent human migrants who dominated and looked down upon the First Wavers, an earlier wave of human settlers who lived in the valleys of Jelucan. Despite lacking any interest in starships and piloting, the young Dalven wanted to join the Imperial Academy because he wanted to gain prestige and power. By contrast, Thane was an enthusiastic fan of starships and regularly studied manuals and practiced gliding.[1]
            At the age of twelve, Dalven and his family attended a public parade in Jelucan's main city Valentia. Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, a senior Imperial government official, had visited Valentia to announce the official incorporation of Jelucan into the Galactic Empire. For this parade, the Imperial Navy had marshaled out several Imperial Star Destroyers, TIE fighters, and Lambda-class shuttles to impress the local inhabitants. During the parade, he belittled Thane for correctly identifying the engine roar of a Lambda-class shuttle and told his parents that they should not have brought his younger brother along. Thane ignored his older brother's whining and befriended a valley dweller named Ciena Ree after defending her from a group of second-wave bullies.[1]
            As a teenager, Dalven continued his acrimonious relationship with his younger brother. He despised Thane's First Waver friend Ciena as a primitive barbarian and made fun of her poverty and old-fashioned ways. On one occasion, Dalven's taunts provoked his younger brother into striking him until they were forcibly pulled apart by their father Oris, who was a strict disciplinarian who regularly beat his sons. Oris favored his older son Dalven over Thane, which deepened the wedge between the two brothers. Dalven also forbade his younger brother from flying his V-171 airspeeder, something which Thane and Ciena ignored.[1]
            When Dalven was old enough to join the Imperial Academy, Oris bribed the local official to admit his son in order to bolster the family name. By contrast, Oris did not afford his younger son Thane such a privilege and made it clear that Thane would have to work his own way to the Academy. Due to his father Oris' connections to the Imperial establishment on Jelucan, Dalven was given a place at an unspecified lesser Imperial Academy. As an Imperial cadet, he was assigned the designation HJ290. Despite his parents' hopes for their eldest son, Dalven performed poorly in his studies at the Imperial Academy. By contrast, Thane passed the academy preparatory course with flying colors and was admitted to the prestigious Royal Imperial Academy.[1]
            Upon graduation, Dalven was assigned to work as a third-class clerical staff in the Imperial Navy. Rather than lose face, Dalven told his family that he had received the rank of lieutenant in the Navy. Shortly after receiving his new uniform, Dalven encountered his younger brother Thane, who had been at the Royal Imperial Academy for just three months. Due to their difficult relationship, the two brothers did not exchange any greetings. Dalven expressed bemusement that his younger brother had not "washed out yet." After Thane realized Dalven had been assigned to work as clerical staff, Dalven bid his younger brother farewell before slipping away.[1]
            Unlike his younger brother Thane, Dalven remained loyal to the Galactic Empire and did not defect to the Rebellion following the destruction of Alderaan. Dalven and his parents believed a faux Imperial report by the Imperial officer Ciena Ree claiming that Thane had committed suicide due to his inability to cope with Alderaan's destruction. They were unaware that Thane had become a starfighter pilot in the Rebel Alliance's Corona Squadron. Dalven continued serving the Imperial Navy following the Battle of Endor and the Battle of Jakku.[1]
            In the wake of the Empire's major defeat at the hands of the New Republic on the planet Jakku, the now-Lieutenant Dalven was assigned to the Imperial attack cruiser Garrote where he assisted commander Nash Windrider, a senior TIE fighter pilot who had been a former friend of Thane. While Windrider knew the truth about Thane's survival, he chose to keep this information from Kyrell and treat him as an individual. As the flight commander's assistant, Dalven's tasks were considered basic.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dalven_Kyrell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDalvenKyrell</string></dict>

        <key>Isolder</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1044.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Isolder was the former heir, or Chume'da, of the Hapes Consortium. As the second son of Queen Mother Ta'a Chume, Isolder was not expected to rule. However, after his older brother Kalen was murdered, Isolder went on an undercover quest to hunt down the person responsible. Impressed by his finding of the culprit, his mother granted him the rank of Chume'da. In 8 ABY, Isolder fell in love with Leia Organa when she came to Hapes to discuss a possible alliance between the New Republic and the Hapes Consortium. However, she was kidnapped by Han Solo, former smuggler and New Republic General. With Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, he followed Han and Leia to the planet Dathomir, where they were captured by the Dathomiri Witch Teneniel Djo. Though she was in love with Skywalker at first, she later fell in love with Isolder, and married him after they defeated Zsinj, an Imperial Warlord.
            Shortly after his marriage to Teneniel, Ta'a Chume stepped down as Queen Mother, and Isolder and Teneniel ruled over the Consortium. Isolder and Teneniel had a daughter, Tenel Ka, who trained as a Jedi, and was the new Chume'da of the Hapes Cluster. However, Isolder and Teneniel's relationship became rocky, especially when Ta'a Chume became unhappy with Tenel Ka, who refused to take the Hapan crown. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Isolder was pivotal in allowing the Hapan Royal Navy to participate at the ill-fated Battle of Fondor, and later suffered the murder of his wife due to his mother's plotting. Tenel Ka, however, took the throne instead of her friend, Jaina Solo, who had been manipulated by Ta'a Chume into trying to take the throne. After he crowned his daughter as the new Queen Mother, Isolder served as an advisor to her, and helped her deal with the politics of Hapes. He would later become a grandfather to Allana, Tenel Ka's daughter along with the Jedi Jacen Solo; though his identity as the father was kept a secret to many except for a select few, one of them being Isolder. Isolder was later killed by Solo, who had become the Sith Lord Darth Caedus, during the Second Galactic Civil War, by having his neck snapped with the Force while he was trying to save his daughter and Allana from a nanovirus sent to kill them.
            Isolder was born into the royal family of Hapes as the younger son of Ta'a Chume and her consort, although he later had several younger half-brothers from Ta'a Chume's quest to provide a female heir to the throne.[3] Growing up, he had the company of his older brother Kalen, who was the Chume'da of the Hapes Consortium. Kalen and Isolder were close, and Isolder did not envy his brother's status as the heir, mainly because he knew that as the second child he had more options available to him.[5]
            When Isolder was nineteen,[5] Kalen was kidnapped and murdered by a pirate near the Terephon system, which left Isolder devastated. In order to track down his brother's murderer, Isolder went undercover as a privateer to get information on who committed the crime. After two years of going so deep undercover that his own mother's spies could not even locate him, Isolder located the perpetrator, a pirate named Harravan, and had him arrested. Unfortunately, Harravan was killed in his jail cell before he could be interrogated further.[6]
            Impressed by Isolder's resolve to bring his brother's murderer to justice, Ta'a Chume named him the new Chume'da. However, Isolder suffered further tragedy when his fiancée, Lady Elliar, apparently committed suicide by drowning herself in one of Hapes' reflecting pools. It would later come out that Ta'a Chume had arranged the murders of both Kalen and Lady Elliar on political grounds, as she found them both too weak to rule.[6]
            When Leia Organa came to Hapes in 8 ABY to discuss a possible alliance with the New Republic, Isolder fell in love with her. As was the Hapan custom, Isolder asked his mother for permission to marry Leia, which she pretended to agree to. When the Hapans arrived at Coruscant, they presented Leia with a gift from each of the Hapes Consortium's many planets. Isolder himself was presented as a gift from Hapes, and he proposed marriage to Leia.[6]
            Upon seeing Leia's shocked expression, Isolder requested that she spend some time to get to know him and that they take a tour of the Hapes Cluster before she made her final decision. Shortly afterward, Isolder was informed by his chief of security, Astarta, that Leia was the target of an assassination attempt. Isolder assumed that his aunt was behind it, but could not prove it. When the attempt on Leia's life was made a short while later, Isolder and Astarta were able to foil it.[6]
            Han Solo, who was threatened by and jealous of Isolder, told Isolder that he was going to challenge him for Leia's hand in marriage. Isolder responded by bribing Solo with a Hapes Nova battle cruiser if he would fly far away and leave Leia alone. Solo refused, and after he won the deed to the planet Dathomir in a high stakes game of sabacc, he kidnapped Leia using the Gun of Command she received as a gift and took her to Dathomir for the sole purpose of impressing her. Upon hearing that Leia was kidnapped by Solo, Isolder set out to gather leads on the pair's whereabouts, but his mother and her agents acquired the information before he did. Isolder then had a conversation with his mother, and despite her advice regarding putting himself in danger, he resolved to rescue Leia by himself.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Isolder</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascIsolder</string></dict>

He was presumed killed when the Crusader's schism was destroyed. The presumption proved to be wrong, however. Following this realization Mandalore placed a bounty on the Blacklist for him, causing him to be chased by the best Bounty Hunters in the galaxy. Jicoln however proved to be extremely elusive prey. Hiding out on Taris, Jicoln successfully evaded capture for nearly a decade, becoming one with his surroundings, Jicoln used the environment of Taris itself as a weapon. At some point Jicoln killed the Sith Lord Darth Shattra on Taris and kept his skull as a trophy. Cadera had a son named Torian.
            As hunters continually gave up or died on the hunt, it was assumed that no one would ever catch him. As such the hunt for Jicoln became more a tradition than an actual hunt, each new Great Hunt Champion taking on the hunt as their first blacklist contract. During the start of the Galactic War however, Jicoln met his match when the newest winner of the great hunt, aided by Jicoln's son Torian, took up the hunt. Seeing the Champion as a potentially worthy opponent, Jicoln challenged the hunter to the "Game of Annihilation", a Mandalorian challenge where the loser not only died, but was said to have their legacy and all memory of them completely eradicated.
            As Jicoln stalked the Champion trying to kill them, Torian successfully tracked his father and ambushed him at his base camp inside the wreckage of the Endar Spire. Unaware that Torian was his son Jicoln badly wounded him and escaped, but was wounded himself and forced to set up a camp elsewhere, where he was confronted by the Champion. Jicoln berated the champion for letting a novice (Torian) try to finish him, saying that the hunter and Mandalore were content to let younger people die for them. After he was defeated Torian appeared and confronted his father, revealing himself to be his son. In the end Jicoln was either killed by the hunter, his son Torian, or frozen in carbonite and sent to Mandalore, completing the oldest contract on the Blacklist.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jicoln_Cadera</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJicolnCadera</string></dict>
        <key>Kadir  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1047.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kadir was an elderly male Human who worked as a janitor at the South Apartments on the planet Taris. However, his quality of work was often complained about, although Kadir claimed to do his best with the resources available to him. In 3956 BBY, he encountered Galactic Republic soldiers Revan and Carth Onasi in the South Apartments, telling them about himself and giving them directions to nearby points of interest.
            Born on the Outer Rim world of Taris, Kadir was an elderly man[1] by 3956 BBY.[2] In his younger years, he enjoyed going to the Upper City Cantina for a drink and to catch up on the latest news, but as he grew older he began to prefer a more solitary lifestyle. Kadir spent most of his time in the South Apartments of the Upper City, where he worked as a janitor. The tenants of the South Apartments constantly complained about the messiness of the building, even though Kadir claimed he did the best he could with the equipment that was available to him. He asked several times for an assistant to help him with his work, but his requests were denied by the owners of the building. He found life in the Upper City decent but was wary of the swoop gangs that were active in the Lower City.[1]
            When, in 3956 BBY,[2] Darth Malak's Sith Empire ambushed and destroyed the Galactic Republic cruiser Endar Spire upon its arrival into the Taris system, two Republic soldiers, Revan and Carth Onasi, managed to flee to the surface of Taris in escape pods. After they crash-landed, they began renting an old, unused room in the South Apartments for use as a hideout. The Sith, trying to prevent any surviving Republic forces from leaving, proceeded to capture and quarantine the planet.[1]
            Kadir had just finished cleaning the floor of the South Apartments when he was approached by Revan and Onasi. Kadir told the duo about himself, Taris, and his opinion on the Sith, as well as giving them directions to the nearby Upper City cantina and Kebla Yurt's Equipment Emporium. Revan and Onasi eventually left, and Kadir went back to work cleaning the apartments.[1]
            Kadir was highly sensitive, but friendly and helpful as long as others respected him and did not use his occupation as a source of insult. Residents living illegally in the apartments did not feel the need to hide their activities from Kadir, as he was perceived to be senile and therefore harmless. As a janitor, Kadir was expected to clean the entire South Apartments alone. He did his best but was unable to complete all of his tasks without an assistant or more advanced equipment, which led to complaints from many of the apartment's tenants.[1]
            Kadir was content with his occupation and living standards. He had never left and was not planning to leave his homeworld during the course of his lifetime, and so was unconcerned when the Sith enforced a quarantine in 3956 BBY that banned all starships from entering or leaving Taris.[1]
            Kadir's first appearance was as a non-player character labeled "Janitor" in the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video game, in which the player, Revan, can interact with him. However, the nature of the conversation is such that it does not progress any plot, nor does it change the players' alignment. Therefore, it is unclear whether Revan ever canonically interacts with Kadir, and, if so, the exact form the conversation takes.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kadir_(Tarisian)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKadir</string></dict>
        <key>Calphayus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1048.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Calphayus, also known as the "Prophet of the Masters", was a powerful Sith Assassin and a member of the Dread Masters. He wielded a cyan bladed saberstaff.
            Calphayus was freed with the other Dread Masters by an Imperial who traveled to The Tomb on Belsavis. After demonstrating their powers on a Republic security force, the Dread Masters terrorized the Esh-kha before leaving the planet. After the Sith Emperor's supposed death, the Dread Masters broke away from the Empire and decided to take the galaxy for themselves.
            He planned Asation's assault, making his presence clear via mental statements throughout the progression of the Strike teams who came to assist the Gree, though he never appeared on Asation. Calphayus dispatched the three most powerful Commanders of the Dread Host, named Ciphas, Heirad and Kel'sara. These three Sith sought to stop the strike team, but through their intense battle, they were defeated. Calphayus stated upon Kel'sara`s death; "The Shield is broken, but the sword is drawn." Calphayus ultimately unleashed the Terror From Beyond after the death of Kephess, but the Terror was defeated and the plans of using Asation as a standing ground failed.
            Upon their return to Oricon, Calphayus along with the rest of the Dread Masters began to become insane with the loss of Styrak. His visions became stronger and more detailed, but his over confidence led him to believe they were accurate and would in fact occur. Calphayus dueled with the team responsible for the death of Kephess, Styrak, Brontes, Ciphas, Heirad and Kel'sara. His mastery of time, space and knowledge allowed him to extend his power through the future and past, though his plans were foiled. He was defeated in his inner sanctum and returned to the council room to recuperate.
            When confronted once more, Calphayus began to emit a deadly field of power, reflecting all damage to the user as he proceeded to drop corrupted fields beneath him, giving his enemies little room to work with. Eventually Calphayus was defeated, but survived the encounter. Broken, alone and free, he escaped the palace, removing the golden crest he and his fellow Dread Masters wore to mask their faces, revealing him to be a withered old man, a testament to how long he had been a Sith and a Dread Master.
            Calphayus wandered Oricon after the death of his fellow masters, soon arriving at the Republic Strike team camp. There he sought to reason with the team, telling them of his rather human past. He was once married, felt no fear or pain towards his wife or life in general. But once he and his friends, now Dread Masters, studied the Phobis devices, they became linked mentally and physically in a weave of Terror and Madness, distorting and changing him into a living entity of Madness. Calphayus was weak, scared, alone and looking for hope. The strike team decided to show mercy, and let him be cared for and evaluated by the Jedi.
            Republic players have the option to spare Calphayus and allow him to undergo treatment by the Jedi (light side) or deem him unworthy of redemption for his past crimes and kill him (dark side). Imperial players do not get the option to spare or kill Calphayus.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Calphayus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCalphayus</string></dict>
        <key>Jaric Kaedan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1049.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jaric Kaedan was a Human male Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Great Galactic War against the resurgent Sith Empire. Also known as the Order's Watchman, Kaedan was born in the Outer Rim Territories in the decades before the war and taken in for training by the Jedi at the age of twelve, becoming a Jedi Knight under the tutelage of Ngani Zho. Serving valiantly on battlefields across the galaxy during the war, Kaedan was instrumental in the capture of the Sith Lords known as the Dread Masters in 3668 BBY, and as a Jedi Master he fought in the Battle of Rhen Var in the last months of the war. When the Treaty of Coruscant brought the war to a close in 3653 BBY, Kaedan was appointed to the Jedi High Council in the subsequent Cold War and accompanied the rest of Order to their recently rediscovered homeworld of Tython. Training a Sullustan Padawan by the name of Nae Nuuv to Knighthood, Kaedan remained ever-vigilant against the threat of the Sith, and he joined the Republic Military in combating the Empire on Ilum in 3641 BBY after the Galactic War began. Leading a contingent to reclaim the Jedi Temple on the Order's sacred world, Kaedan was killed by a Sith strike team during the Battle of Ilum.
            A Force-sensitive Human male, Jaric Kaedan born in the Outer Rim Territories[1] sometime before the year 3691 BBY.[2] He was discovered by the Jedi Order at the age of twelve[1] and underwent training in the ways of the Force by Jedi Master Ngani Zho,[4] attaining the rank of Jedi Knight sometime during the Great Galactic War between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. In 3668 BBY, Kaedan led a team of troopers from the Republic Special Forces Division on a mission to capture the six Sith Lords known as the Dread Masters. Kaedan and the Special Forces team infiltrated the dreadnought and successfully defeated them in combat, withstanding the Sith's ability to influence their opponents' fear through battle meditation. Kaedan also downloaded the dreadnought's entire Imperial database before scuttling the vessel, gaining a valuable source of intelligence for the Republic and convincing the Empire that the Dread Masters had been killed in the assault.[2] Sometime after becoming a Knight, Kaedan had a hostile encounter with the Cult of M'dweshuu,[4] a brutal religious sect of the Nikto species,[7] and Kaedan was rescued from the situation by Master Zho. However, Kaedan became angry with Zho as a result of the encounter, and he still had not spoken with his former Master[4] by the time of Zho's death in 3643 BBY.[8]
            As the war neared the end of its third decade, Kaedan was sent to the planet Rhen Var alongside Satele Shan, Syo Bakarn, and Bela Kiwiiks, all of whom were former students of Master Zho. By that time, Kaedan had become a master of a variation of the seventh form of lightsaber combat known as "Juyo-Kos," and he was considered to be living weapon who was guided by the Force itself. The four Jedi found the Republic Military's 45th Battalion in disarray after a brutal Imperial invasion, and Kaedan discussed their plans with Kiwiiks and Shan while Bakarn healed wounded soldiers. He scoffed at what he saw as fear on the behalf of Kiwiiks, claiming that the Jedi would easily hold off the enemy at the pass, but he was contradicted by Shan. Under the leadership of Shan, the Jedi and the remaining Republic troopers launched a furious assault on the Imperial forces, and Kaedan cut down many enemy soldiers and Sith with his twin green-bladed lightsabers. During the battle, Kaedan rescued Bakarn from an attacking Sith by shoving his fellow Jedi out of the way and blocking the enemy's blade with his own weapons. The battle ended when Shan defeated Darth Mekhis, the Sith commander on Rhen Var and a member of the Empire's ruling Dark Council, in a duel within the Sith's fortress.[4] The war ended not long afterwards with the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant in 3653 BBY, which forced the Republic to withdraw all of their forces and submit to the Empire's terms on account of the Imperial invasion of the capital planet Coruscant.[9]
            During the subsequent Cold War, Kaedan was made a Jedi Master and later appointed to the Jedi High Council alongside Bakarn,[10] Shan, Kiwiiks, Orgus Din,[5] and another Jedi, as six of the Council members had been killed during the Sacking of Coruscant.[11]
            Some time later, as Tol Braga's strike team, which included himself, Leeha Narezz, Warren Sedoru and the Hero of Tython, was preparing to depart for the Emperor's cloaked space station in hopes of capturing him so he could be redeemed, the Jedi Council and Jedi Knight Jomar Chul chose to intervene. Kaedan expressed uncertainty that Braga's plan would succeed, but Chul had a more disturbing revelation. Chul explained that he had a vision of the Hero falling to the dark side and becoming Sith and insisted he take the Hero's place on the mission. However, Satele and Kiwiiks expressed confidence in the Hero's loyalty and sanctioned the mission, to Chul's frustration as he stormed out of the Council chamber. Kaedan pleaded one last time with Braga to abandon his plan, but the latter insisted it would work.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jaric_Kaedan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJaricKaedan</string></dict>

        <key>Lando Calrissian</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1051.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lando Calrissian was a Human male professional gambler, entrepreneur, smuggler, and general throughout various points in his life. Born on Socorro, he became a gambler and con man early in his life and acquired his own ship, the Millennium Falcon, in a game of sabacc with a man named Cix Trouvee. He went on to have numerous adventures with the Falcon and its piloting droid, Vuffi Raa, during which he ran afoul of a Sorcerer of Tund named Rokur Gepta, whom Calrissian eventually killed. After a series of events led to him losing the Millennium Falcon to a Corellian named Han Solo on Bespin, Calrissian eventually became the Baron Administrator of Cloud City for a time—a position he once again gained through sabacc.
            In 3 ABY, Cloud City was taken over by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War as part of a deal gone wrong. Calrissian had previously agreed to turn over a group of Rebels to the Empire, including Han Solo and Leia Organa, as part of bait for a trap for Jedi Luke Skywalker. However, Darth Vader altered the deal to the point where Calrissian felt he was no longer able to tolerate it. Subsequently, he joined the Rebel Alliance and took part in numerous missions on its behalf; in particular, in search for Han Solo, who had been frozen in carbonite due to Calrissian's betrayal on Bespin. Calrissian eventually participated in Solo's rescue and the defeat of Jabba the Hutt. Following Solo's rescue, Calrissian continued to serve with the Alliance and during the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Calrissian piloted his old ship, the Millennium Falcon, into the second Death Star's core to destroy its reactor.
            Afterward, he continued to serve the newly formed New Republic in times of need, but spent most of his time pursuing various business ventures, specializing in mining. A venture on the sun-baked world of Nkllon was soured by multiple attacks from the Empire under Grand Admiral Thrawn, but Calrissian invested in a number of other entrepreneurial plans, including mining operations on Varn and Kessel. In 18 ABY, Calrissian met and fell in love with Tendra Risant, marrying her soon after the Bastion Accords were signed. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Calrissian aided the New Republic through his leadership and the YVH 1 droids that his company, Tendrando Arms, produced to combat the extragalactic invaders. He also helped to arrange the election of Cal Omas as Chief of State following the New Republic's reorganization into the Galactic Alliance.
            Calrissian, along with his wife Tendra, continued to manage Tendrando Arms following the war. His YVH droids played significant roles in the subsequent Dark Nest Crisis, Swarm War, and Second Galactic Civil War. During the latter conflict, Calrissian aided his friends Han and Leia Solo in their efforts against their son Jacen Solo, who had fallen to the dark side and become a Sith, until Calrissian was informed that Tendra was pregnant; he then spent the rest of the war with her. After the war's conclusion, Calrissian settled down with Tendra in a life of quiet luxury, managing Tendrando Arms and raising his son, Lando Calrissian, Junior. He was later contacted by Luke Skywalker for assistance during a mission to the Maw with Skywalker's Sith allies. Calrissian reluctantly agreed, and successfully carried out the mission. Afterward, he returned to Coruscant and warned the Jedi of not only the danger posed by the Sith, but also the hidden menace which Skywalker and the Sith were pursuing. To that end, he assisted in getting a large number of Jedi StealthX wing starfighters offworld to assist the Skywalkers.
            According to historians, Calrissian's early years were obscured by history and Calrissian's own fabrications.[11] He was originally a Socorran,[1] leaving him with a hint of a Corellian accent[12] thanks to the Corellian origin of Socorro's settlers.[13] His own memories pointed to his having a stable family life until at least the age of seventeen,[14] and he had a vivid enough memory of his mother to recall her ability to memorize hundreds of songs and poems.[15] Calrissian also had enough of a recollection of his father to remember a bit of advice given by him, "You can't think deeper than your pockets."[16] He may have had at least one brother, as evidenced by his thinking of himself as his mother's "favorite son."[17] At the age of three, Calrissian and his mother visited a city during holidays. The young Calrissian stopped to look at an animated display and lost his mother, who went away. Frightened, he wandered through the crowded streets of the city for ten minutes until he found her. This event left a deep impression on him, and he never quite trusted the universe afterward.[18] Calrissian's occupations in his youth were broad, diverse, and temporary, as he was at various times a gambler, rogue, smuggler, mercenary, and con artist.[19]
            By the age of seventeen, Calrissian had already learned to play sabacc. Once, he was able to talk a group of gamblers into letting him participate in a game at a local saloon. Lying to his parents, he ducked school and entered the competition, thus breaking several laws regarding minors. During one round, Calrissian managed to get a winning combination, sabacc, and exclaimed that he had won.

        <key>Hondo Karr</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1053.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Hondo Karr was a Human male Mandalorian, and who served next to Mand'alor Chernan Ordo in the Battle of Botajef. During the battle he was betrayed and, in order to survive and expose the traitor, put on the armor of a stormtrooper and got conscripted into the Joker Squad, a unit in the Army of the Fel Empire. Ten years later, during the Second Imperial Civil War, Karr deserted the new Empire at the Battle of Borosk and found his way into the Galactic Alliance Remnant's famed Rogue Squadron, where he fought for some time, until a chance arose for him to reunite with his former wife and return to the Mandalorian ways, deciding to hunt down the one who betrayed him and bring him to justice.
            In 127 ABY Hondo Karr served next to Mand'alor Chernan Ordo in the Battle of Botajef. During the battle, another Mandalorian by the name of Yaga Auchs, betrayed his comrades, which led to the Mand'alor's death, and left Karr to die. Found by Vevec, father of his wife Tes, Karr decided to get off-world and expose Auchs's treachery. He removed his beskar'gam and put on the armor of a dead stormtrooper. Soon, Vevec was killed by advancing troopers and Karr, posing as the last soldier of his unit, was accepted in the 407th Stormtrooper Division.
            During the Battle of Borosk, Karr was shocked at the notion of being ordered to kill fellow stormtroopers. Despite his feelings, he continued to follow his orders. But the final straw came after the battle was over. Darth Maleval, the Sith Lord overseeing the battle, put Lieutenant Gil Cassel, Karr's commanding officer, through a cruel loyalty test: he was to kill his own brother, or be executed as a traitor himself. Gil refused, and the Sith Lord executed both men. Karr, enraged at this, attacked Maleval with a vibroknife. But Maleval simply knocked Karr out of the way. Saying that avenging a traitor made him a traitor, Maleval attacked Karr with his electro-whip. However, the Quarren Sith Lord was shot in the back by Anson Trask, a fellow member of the 407th Division. Karr complemented Trask on his shooting, and left. The official report by Sergeant Ran Harkas stated that Karr had been killed in the battle.
            Karr left the Empire and joined Admiral Gar Stazi and the Galactic Alliance Remnant. He was made a member of Rogue Squadron, despite his past. Karr later earned the respect of Andurgo, a fellow Rogue pilot, when he took the blame for a knife fight that they had gotten into.
            At the Battle of Mon Calamari, he led a task force of Alliance troops disguised as stormtroopers as part of Admiral Gar Stazi's plan to hijack the Advanced Star Destroyer Imperious. He later became involved on his risky mission to smuggle a group of Mon Calamari refugees from Napdu. While the mission went successfully, he was confronted by his former wife Tes Vevec, who believed Karr had killed her father and was seeking vengeance. However, Karr was able to disarm her and convince her to believe his true story. Reunited with his wife, Karr left Rogue Squadron, once again donned a suit of Mandalorian armor which he repainted black and gold, the traditional Mandalorian colors for "justice" and "vengeance", and swore to track down Yaga Auchs, who'd declared himself the new Mand'alor.
            A Mandalorian and ex-stormtrooper, Karr had a silent, intense personality and a fondness for vibroknives. His experiences on the battlefield, and the deaths of individuals such as Vevec and Jes Gistang, had led him to avoid forming attachments to his comrades-in-arms. Nevertheless he kept a personal code of loyalty to those that served alongside him, including his superiors, as well as a dislike for unnecessary cruelty, an attitude that prompted him to attack Darth Maleval when the Sith Lord executed the Cassel brothers.
            A figure of Hondo Karr was created by Entertainment Earth and unveiled at Comic Con International 2008 as part of the Joker Squad action figure 6-pack.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hondo_Karr</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHondoKarr</string></dict>
        <key>Morgan Katarn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1054.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Morgan Katarn was a Force-sensitive Human male who was close friends with Jedi Master Qu Rahn, a leader in the Rebel Alliance, and the father of Kyle Katarn.
            During childhood, Morgan often used his Force power to entertain his younger sister. He became reluctant to use the Force, however, when a Force Push led to the accidental death of a bully.
            He was an agro-mech craftsman and a self-taught roboticist; he constructed his home droid WeeGee.
            As a farmer, a faulty BT-16 perimeter droid killed his wife Patricia. Despite Morgan's allegiance to the Rebellion, he sent his son Kyle Katarn to the Imperial Academy on Carida in hopes of giving him a proper education.
            Morgan in the meantime learned the location of the mythical Valley of the Jedi, situated at an ancient battle site on the planet Ruusan, a source of almost unlimited power; it brought him in the path of the Jedi Qu Rahn, who was looking for it. Morgan had been entrusted with the lightsaber of his Jedi friend, which he placed within a hidden compartment in the family's homemade droid, WeeGee. Along with this, Morgan created a holorecording for his son Kyle that only the droid could decode. It told Kyle of his Jedi potential and of the importance of protecting the location of the Valley of the Jedi, as well as entrusting Rahn's Lightsaber to him.
            Morgan Katarn had put a complex map of Ruusan on the roof of his home believing that nobody would notice its existence.
            Jerec was interested in whatever information Katarn possessed, and ordered the Ghost Battalion to capture him alive. Led by Lieutenant Brazack and disguised as Rebels, the Battalion launched a raid on Sulon. They killed the Danga family and burned the Katarn homestead, but Morgan avoided capture as he was absent. He returned during the assault and secretly recorded the attack with his electrobinoculars before the soldiers left which he presented shortly later in a Rebel meeting; Katarn and Skorg Jameson considered they were an attempt to attack the G-Tap, to force the population of Sulon to depend on SoroSuub Corporation and, by extension, pay taxes to the Empire.
            In an attack on Barons Hed by Imperial forces, again masquerading as Rebels, Morgan was captured and brought aboard the Vengeance by Jerec who interrogated and then beheaded him with a vibroblade. Morgan's head was then placed on a spike outside the walls of Barons Hed. This led Kyle to despise the Rebellion. Only when Jan Ors revealed the truth did Kyle follow in his father's footsteps and desert the Empire.
            What Jerec did not know at this time was the map to the Valley of the Jedi within the roof of his homestead. He later found the map after forcing the information from the mind of Qu Rhan.
            Morgan appeared as a Force ghost—speaking to Luke Skywalker about the Valley of the Jedi and then later to his son Kyle, at the Valley itself.
            Morgan Katarn was portrayed by Jacob Witkin for the live-action sequences of Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II and all other appearances of Morgan are based on Witkin's likeness. Morgan Katarn was voiced by David Chase in Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire audio drama and Dark Forces: Rebel Agent audio drama. Jacob Witkin would later reprise his role as Morgan Katarn in Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.
            There appears to be some conflict between the sources as regards the death of Morgan Katarn. In Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire Jerec beheads him with a vibroblade, yet in the Soldier for the Empire audio dramatization Jerec beheads him with his lightsaber. Still another source, Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight Maw tells Kyle that Jerec gave Morgan a sweet slow death. Of course, it is possible that Maw just says it to goad Kyle into getting into touch with the dark side, or that Morgan was tortured prior to his decapitation.
            In Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, Morgan Katarn's multiplayer skin is used in campaign mode as a single, generic Jedi in the Yavin IV level.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Morgan_Katarn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMorganKatarn</string></dict>

        <key>Kyle Katarn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1056.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Kyle Katarn was a famous Human male Rebel operative from Sulon and later a Jedi of the New Jedi Order. He was a former Imperial stormtrooper who defected to the Rebellion. Often paired with fellow Rebel agent and smuggler Jan Ors, he performed many covert missions for the Rebel Alliance and later the New Republic, including the sabotage of the Dark Trooper Project.
            Katarn was later informed of his Force-sensitivity, and taught himself to become a Jedi while in search of the Valley of the Jedi. During this journey, he confronted the dark side within both himself and in the form of the Dark Jedi Jerec and his minions. After defeating them, Katarn went on to become a Jedi Master, teaching at the Jedi Praxeum. He participated in the offensives against the Yuuzhan Vong and became a part of the Jedi High Council in the New Jedi Order.
            Kyle was the son of Morgan and Patricia Katarn, farmers from the Sullust colony moon of Sulon. Growing up on the farm, Katarn had found a brother of sorts in his father's custom-made labor droid, WeeGee. As a result, Katarn became one of the few Humans in the galaxy fluent in the electronic language of droidspeak.[4]
            After learning about his mother's death at the claw of a malfunctioning BT-16 perimeter security droid, Katarn enrolled at the Imperial Academy on Carida. Living out on the rim, he had few other opportunities to obtain an education. During a raid on a Rebel asteroid base, Katarn began to suspect his Force potential, a trait passed to him by his father, when he experienced several premonitions that saved the lives of many of his strike team members. While on the mission, Katarn also met Jan Ors, an agent working for the Rebellion. Katarn and Ors were on opposite sides of the war, but they experienced a strange connection that led Katarn to spare her life as well as the lives of many of the station's inhabitants. As a result of the success of his mission, Katarn became a decorated Imperial stormtrooper officer, but his father, unbeknownst to him, was a supporter of the Rebel Alliance.
            Following this last mission, which was his Omega Exercise, Katarn learned that his father had been killed in a suspected Rebel raid on his homeworld of Sulon. Katarn, recalling the lives he spared on the asteroid base, became extremely hateful towards the Rebellion, believing them to be murderers.[4]
            Putting aside his grief for the time, Katarn took a pleasure cruise on the Star of Empire, his last bit of freedom before officially becoming an officer in the Imperial navy. It was while on this ship that he met Lando Calrissian, and ran into Jan Ors for the second time. After a brief chase and a brawl with some of Ors's fellow agents, Katarn's attention was grabbed when Ors dropped the name Sulon. Ors showed Katarn footage from the battle there that had been obtained by a reporter and her loyal droid. She explained to him that it was in fact the Imperials who had staged the attack. They had painted Rebel insignias on their ships to make it seem as if the Rebels had been the aggressors. Their use of standard Imperial tactics, which Katarn had studied extensively at the Imperial Academy, gave them away.[4]
            After seeing the footage for himself, Katarn became distrustful towards the Empire and defected, becoming a neutral mercenary. He left the Star of Empire with Ors and her fellow agents aboard their ship after a brief scuffle with some Imperials and a bounty hunter that worked for them. During this incident, the droid with the recordings of the battle on Sulon was captured and self-destructed, allowing Katarn and the others to make a clean escape. Ors took Katarn back to her base and introduced him to Mon Mothma, the leader of the Alliance, and he became a Rebel spy.[4]
            Soon after his recruitment into the Alliance, Katarn was responsible for introducing the Twi'lek Rianna Saren to the organization. He first tasked her with infiltrating a Black Sun warehouse on Coruscant to discover how they were involved with the Empire. After Saren successfully completed this mission, Katarn revealed to her that he was a Rebel agent and introduced her to Leia Organa.[12]
            Katarn's first mission for the Alliance was the infiltration of an Imperial facility on Danuta to retrieve the plans for the first Death Star as a part of Operation Skyhook. While viewing the briefing information, he recognized his friend from the Academy, Meck Odom, as one of the officers in charge of guarding the plans. Katarn met with Odom secretly, and he gave Katarn information that assisted him in completing his mission. He also deactivated the perimeter, allowing Katarn entry into the base. The partial plans stolen by Katarn were eventually combined with those captured at Toprawa, on the Death Star itself, and by Rianna Saren and Zeeo after their battle against Imperial slave master Zarian Kheev on Danuta,[12] to create a complete outline of the station.[3]
            Soon after the Battle of Yavin, Mon Mothma asked Katarn to investigate the destruction of Tak Base resulting from the attack on Tak Base. Katarn accepted, and, upon request, took on Jan Ors as his mission officer. Katarn's investigation revealed the Imperial Dark Trooper project, led by Clone Wars veteran General Rom Mohc. Several clues led Katarn to Anoat, where he captured Moff Rebus, an infamous Imperial weapons engineer. After raiding a testing facility for phrik on the planet Fest, Katarn was led to the Gromas system, where the mineral was being mined and the first stage of the Dark Trooper was manufactured. After destroying the facility, Katarn had to rescue Crix Madine from an Imperial detention center on Orinackra and traveled to the Ramsees Hed docking port on Cal-Seti. There, he was able to track a smuggling ship that was making runs to the frozen planet of Anteevy, where the second stage of Dark Trooper construction was being completed. Katarn destroyed the facility on Anteevy and was led to Nar Shaddaa, where he located a nav card describing the activities of all the smugglers involved in the Dark Trooper project. Upon leaving the planet, though, Katarn and Ors were briefly captured by Jabba the Hutt.[3]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kyle_Katarn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKyleKatarn</string></dict>
        <key>Ketu</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1057.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ketu was a Human male Je'daii Temple Master who served the Je'daii Order on Tython at the height of the Infinite Empire's reign. He was considered to be one of the Order's most powerful and wise masters of the era, and served as the leader of the Je'daii Council. Residing at Akar Kesh, the Temple of Balance, Ketu was looked to in times of crisis, war, and peace, to lead the Je'daii through and keep the planet Tython in Balance with the Force.
            A Force-sensitive Human, Ketu was trained in the ways of the Force by the Je'daii Order on the planet Tython, one of nine planets in the Tython system which made up the Settled Worlds. Trained directly under Je'daii Master Rajivari, Ketu was appointed as a Je'daii Temple Master, the highest ranking members of the Order, in 25,805 BBY following the death of Master Telaat.[3] Governing the Great Temple of Balance, Akar Kesh, Ketu carried no weapon and along with the other Temple Masters formed the Masters' Council, meeting via holocommunication within the massive Tho Yor at Akar Kesh.[4] A teacher and adviser to Je'daii of all ages, Ketu resided within a chamber carved into the body of the great monolithic pillar which contained the Temple of Akar Kesh.[5]
            When the Devourer, a starship of Rakatan design, crash landed on Tython in 25,793 BBY Master Ketu met with Je'daii Ranger Rori Fenn within his chambers to discuss the Force storm which gripped the planet. Unsettled by the wave of dark side energy which had tipped the scales of the Balance in the Force, and fearing that the ship might be but the first of an entire fleet, Ketu dispatched Fenn to the site near the Rift to determine the nature of the crash and search out survivors.[5] Traveling up into the Tho Yor above Akar Kesh to meet via holocommunication with members of the Masters' Council, Ketu listened to a report from Temple Master Kora Ryo who believed the Force storm that had set over Tython was the worst since the arrival of the Tho Yor nearly ten thousand years prior. After listening to a report given remotely by Temple Master Quan-Jang, Ketu ordered the members of the Council to gather what Je'daii they could and enter into group meditation in order to dissipate the storm and return the Force to balance.[4] Successfully ending the storm through their combined meditation, Ketu traveled to Mahara Kesh to meet with the Je'daii who had investigate the crash site and to meet their prisoner, the sole survivor of the vessel. Known as Xesh, the Human was steeped in the dark side of the Force and was far from balanced. Having conferred with the Council, Ketu banished Xesh to the moon of Bogan to meditate and reflect on the dark side until he found Balance. Despite the pleas of Je'daii Journeyers Tasha Ryo, Shae Koda, and Sek'nos Rath, Ketu's decision was made and Xesh was taken offworld.[6]
            Seeking answers, Ketu journeyed out beyond the waterfalls of Akar Kesh in search of his former master, Rajivari. Finding him deep in meditation at the feet of an ancient and weathered statue, Ketu recounted the crash of the ship and the pleas of the Journeyers who claimed to have had a vision regarding Xesh's arrival. Rajivari rebuked his former student for dismissing their vision and exiling Xesh, claiming that the Council had made the same mistake seven years prior by exiling Daegen Lok and ignoring his own vision. Disagreeing with Rajivari, Ketu left on the paddle boat he had arrived on with more questions then answers.[3] Following Xesh's disappearance from Bogan with fellow exile Daegen Lok, Ketu received Journeyer Tasha Ryo and Masters Rajivari and Ters Sendon in his private quarters. Ryo revealed to him an ancient holocron created by the Kwa race which had once maintained a colony on Tython in the distant past. According to the holocron's gatekeeper called A'nang, the Infinite Empire of the Rakata posed a terrible threat to any world that they encountered because they were vicious and warlike. Realizing that the vision of war Je'daii Lok had been exiled for years prior was coming true, Ketu demanded that Lok and Xesh be captured in anticipation of an invasion by the Rakata. If Xesh, the only survivor of the Rakatan ship which had crashed on Tython, knew anything, Ketu was determined to hear of it.[7] Following the successful capture of both Xesh and Lok, Ketu began to oversee the Order's preparation for war. Asking Ranger Hawk Ryo to his chambers, Ketu inquired after further details of Lok's vision seven years prior. Ryo had been present for the vision and had in fact shared in it, but had lied about it and convinced himself that he had been hallucinating. In Lok's vision, the Je'daii saw himself leading an army to fight against the Rakatan invasion; but Ryo claimed Lok was wrong: Xesh was leading the Je'daii.[8]
            When the Infinite Empire revealed itself, it launched a massive assault on the Tython system which saw the fall of many worlds. As they made their slow approach toward Tython, Master Ketu remained on Tython while Master Rajivari commanded Je'daii forces from Shikaakwa.[9] Following the conclusion of the year-long conflict, Ketu met with the victorious Je'daii general Daegen Lok at the ruins of Anil Kesh, the site of the final victory against the Rakata. Ketu believed it was time to do away with the mysterious weapon known as the Forcesaber, but Lok disagreed and found that it would be useful in the coming years as things changed on Tython.[10]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ketu</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKetu</string></dict>

        <key>Moden Canady</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1060.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Moden Canady was a human male who served as a naval officer in both the Galactic Empire and the First Order. During the reign of the Empire, Canady commanded the Star Destroyer Solicitude of the Imperial Starfleet. He later joined the First Order, becoming captain of the Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix, a capacity in which he served during the evacuation of D'Qar. To his irritation, however, he had to put up with the crew of the Fulminatrix, who were younger than him and, in Canady's view, inexperienced and arrogant. Canady, along with everyone else on his ship, were killed in a Resistance bombing run led by Poe Dameron in the space battle above D'Qar.
            Moden Canady[1] served as the commander[4] of the Star Destroyer Solicitude of the Imperial Starfleet during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Following the Empire's fall, Canady became an officer of the First Order.[4] He eventually became the captain of the Fulminatrix.[1]
            During the evacuation of D'Qar, General Armitage Hux ordered Canady to command the Fulminatrix against the Resistance. During the battle, he ordered his warrant officer, Suday Bascus, to reorient the ship's topside cannons and prepare the onboard fighter squadrons for deployment against the Resistance Fleet, and proceeded to sternly remind the man that there was a difference between the orders "prep for launch" and "launch" when Bascus protested that Hux had previously ordered for the ship not to deploy their fighter squadrons due to wanting to give a demonstration to the Resistance.[5]
            In a surprise maneuver, Wing Commander Poe Dameron led a lone spearhead attack on the point-defense cannons of the Fulminatrix, to the annoyance of General Hux who demanded to know why Canady was not blasting the ship. Canady responded by stating that the ship was too fast and too close for the cannons and ordered his crew to launch their fighters. Canady was then informed by Bascus that there were several Resistance bombers approaching the dreadnought. While his fighters wiped out all but one of the bombers, Canady ordered the crew to fire on the Resistance base, destroying the complex after it was fully evacuated and then had them target the main Resistance cruiser. Before they could fire, however, the gunner Paige Tico managed to launch her ship's payload of bombs against the Fulminatrix, causing systematic destruction. Accepting he had been bested, Canady stood firm silently respecting the courage of his enemies as his ship blew up, killing him and his loathed crew.[3]
            A veteran officer of the Galactic Empire, Moden Canady was proud to serve the First Order just like when he served the Empire at the beginning of his career. However, he loathed having to serve alongside arrogant and inexperienced young First Order officers due to their lack of discipline and failure to work as a team hindering his operational duties, to the point that he once entertained a brief fantasy of ejecting one out of an airlock.[5] Despite this loathing, he nonetheless sympathized to a degree with their zeal for the First Order.[1]
            Canady also detested serving under the command of General Armitage Hux, a First Order officer younger than him.[4] He also held some irritation towards Hux, to the extent that he once privately denounced Hux as a "bloody idiot" after signing off, due to Hux insisting on continuing bad strategy.[6] As Canady suspected, Hux's orders would prove to be Canady's undoing, as Poe Dameron's and Paige Tico's actions eventually led to his death.[3]
            Unlike many officers of the First Order, Canady was honorable, and he demonstrated that trait until the very end. When he became aware that the Fulminatrix had been defeated and there was no escape, he accepted his fate, and remained on his Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought rather than trying to flee.[3]
            Canady was portrayed by Mark Lewis Jones in the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.[3] Jones also provided the voice for Darth Decimus in the 2011 video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, which belongs to the Star Wars Legends continuity.[7]
            Canady's surname is a reference to May Dove Canady, the titular main character of the 2002 film May, on which The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson previously worked as editor.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Moden_Canady</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascModenCanady</string></dict>
        <key>Rycus Kilran</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1061.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rycus Kilran was a Human male who served as Grand Moff of the Sith Empire during the Cold War and the Galactic War. He was best known for his role during the Sacking of Coruscant, which earned him the nickname of the "Butcher of Coruscant," and as the pacifier of the Togruta Uprising.
            Born on Dromund Kaas to a wealthy family with a proud military tradition, Kilran grew into a creative strategist and military leader. He proved himself, to no one's surprise, a capable right-hand man to the Sith during the Empire's early assaults on the Brema sector. When his Sith superior died during the Battle of Ord Ibanna, who Rycus was serving as tactical advisor—he assumed command of the ragged Imperial fleet and led them to a swift and decisive victory.[1]
            In the years that followed, Kilran's authority grew with his list of triumphs, and both the Sith and the Minister of War learned respect for his unorthodox strategies. His brutally effective strikes during the final days of the war, as well as his tactics during the Sacking of Coruscant, earned the Captain the nickname "the Butcher of Coruscant" among Republic civilians, a name he adopted with characteristic irony. His heroic stand against a Jedi boarding party earned him his scars. After the war ended, he was granted the honorary title Grand Moff in recognition of his contributions.[1]
            After the time of the Great Galactic War, Kilran ordered Revinal Orzik, captain of the Black Talon, to intercept a Republic warship, the Brentaal Star, and eliminate the wanted passenger, a renegade Imperial general. When Captain Orzik refused to carry on what he saw as a suicide mission, Kilran sent a small team of operatives to take care of the situation, even while dealing with a Republic boarding party sent against him from a small vessel, the Esseles.[3]
            Towards the end of the Cold War, Kilran was charged with maintaining the prison within the Maelstrom where the Sith Emperor had held a powerful prisoner - the Jedi Master Revan - for three hundred years. He was confronted by the same Republic strike team from the Esseles, now dispatched by Master Oteg. The team had obtained a Gree computer to navigate the Maelstrom from the Imperial base on Taral V, despite Kilran's efforts to bombard the planet before they could successfully escape.
            Impressed and infuriated by the persistence of the Republic team, Kilran personally boarded the prison and informed Darth Malgus - who was watching from a nearby holoterminal - that he would put the intruders out of their misery. Malgus ordered him to focus solely on preserving the prisoner, but Kilran elected to attack anyway, believing he could deal with the problem. In the end, however, he proved unable to withstand the assault as the Republic forces struck him down in the prison's core, putting an end to the Butcher of Coruscant.[4]
            Upon his death, Kilran was succeeded by Grand Moff Ilyan Regus.[5]
            Apart from being the most cunning strategist the Empire has to offer, he has been described as both charismatic and an intellectual genius. He is also very patriotic towards the Empire and would no doubt fight to the bitter end for it. He also had a strong sense of pride; when he was faced with the team of individuals who had repeatedly humiliated him he was willing to disobey Darth Malgus and try to kill them rather than securing Revan like he was ordered to. He was also a great lover of fine wines.[1]
            Kilran was first introduced through a development diary released by BioWare.[3]
            He is voiced by Simon Templeman.
            There are several phrases written in Aurebesh on his page at the official site. When translated, they read: "defense of the secret prison", "Chasing the General", "personal combat expert".[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rycus_Kilran</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRycusKilran</string></dict>
        <key>Kix</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1062.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"Kix" was the nickname of a clone trooper medic who served in the 501st Legion, a unit in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army, during the Clone Wars. Around 21 BBY, Kix participated in a hunt for the Confederacy of Independent Systems Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies, General Grievous, on the planet Saleucami under the command of High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi. Kix, along with troopers Jesse and Hardcase, went with Clone Captain Rex to scour through the planet's wetlands on BARC speeders in search for escape pods that had been jettisoned from Grievous' crashed ship. When two commando droids attacked the clones, Rex was shot in the chest. Kix, Jesse and Hardcase took the injured Rex to a nearby homestead to recover, while they returned to join Kenobi and his team.
            Sometime after Saleucami, Kix joined Rex and the 501st Legion on the planet Umbara, where he served as a medic during a battle there. During the initial assault on the native Umbarans, Kix and the team served under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. Skywalker, however, was relieved of his duties after General Pong Krell arrived, who assumed command of Kix and the 501st Legion on Umbara. During the battle, it was revealed that General Krell was secretly working against the Republic, and so Kix helped in the hunt for, and subsequent apprehension of, the traitorous Jedi.
            "Kix" was the nickname of a clone trooper medic who served in the Grand Army of the Republic.[2] Like all clone troopers, Kix was a clone of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett.[1] Around 21 BBY,[4] during the Clone Wars, Kix served the Galactic Republic under the command of High Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi. After a battle above the planet Saleucami, Confederate General Grievous used an escape pod to jettison from his starship and landed on Saleucami's surface. Chasing after Grievous, Kenobi gathered a team of clone troopers, including Kix, to hunt down the cyborg General on Saleucami.[2] The team found the wreckage of Grievous' ship,[5] and Commander CC-2224, nicknamed "Cody," told Kenobi that the ship had crashed recently. Kenobi decided to split the group into two teams and ordered Captain CT-7567, nicknamed "Rex," to find the other missing escape pods with troopers Kix, Jesse, and Hardcase, while he, Cody, and Crys stayed behind to go through the remains of the crashed ship.[2]
            After mounting separate BARC speeders, Kix's team rode through the wetlands of the planet's surface. Ahead of them, two commando droids were stationed on top of a hill overlooking the clones. Utilizing a blaster sniper rifle, one of the droids shot Rex, knocking the clone Captain off his speeder. Jesse ordered Kix to turn his BARC around and protect the Captain, while he and Hardcase drove toward the hill from where the shot had been fired. Jesse and Hardcase destroyed the droids while Kix examined Rex's injury, and Kix informed Jesse that Rex's injury was severe. Hardcase told Kix and Jesse that the two droid commandos might have called for backup, and they needed to find shelter for Rex.[2] After noticing domesticated eopies,[5] Jesse concluded that they were on farmland, which meant there was a homestead nearby. Kix attached a flatbed onto the side of his BARC speeder and laid Rex on it before the team drove off to find the farmer's homestead.[2]
            Upon arriving at the nearby homestead, a female Twi'lek, Suu, greeted the clones warily, pointing a rifle at the intruders. Kix and Jesse informed her that they were friends and they needed a place to settle the injured Rex for the night, and Suu gave the clones permission to use the barn. After Kix placed a bacta patch on Rex's wound, he regained consciousness, and Jesse and the other troopers informed him of what had recently transpired. Kix told Rex that he was in no condition to fight and that he should rest. Before Kix and the team left to continue their search for the escape pods, Rex gave Jesse the responsibility of leading the search party. After the clones boarded their BARC speeders, Kenobi contacted the group via comlink and called for Rex. Jesse responded and informed the Jedi Master that Rex had been injured, and that the Captain had given him the duty of leading the search for the escape pods. Kenobi told Jesse that Grievous was heading for an abandoned escape pod, and ordered the troopers to drive westward, trapping Grievous between the two squads.[2]
            Later, Jesse contacted Kenobi and informed the Jedi that Kix and the clone troopers had a visual of the escape pod. Grievous was the first to arrive at the escape pod and Kenobi had already engaged Grievous' forces by the time Jesse's team arrived on their BARC speeders. As Kix, Hardcase and Jesse fired their speeder's blaster cannons at Grievous' battle droids, Jesse spotted an approaching Confederate shuttle in the sky and warned Kenobi via comlink. After a clone trooper onboard an AT-TE walker told Kenobi that the walker's guns were overheated, Kenobi ordered Cody and Jesse to cover him as he raced toward Grievous. Kenobi and Grievous engaged in a lightsaber duel as the Confederate shuttle approached them, eventually coming to a stop as it hovered above the escape pod. Grievous fired his tow cable at the hull of the shuttle and fled in the vehicle. While Kix remained with Hardcase, Jesse and Cody—aboard their speeders—returned to Kenobi after dispatching the remaining battle droids. The Jedi Master told both clone troopers to contact the fleet and order them to send a transport to pick them all up.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kix</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKix</string></dict>
        <key>Vidar Kim</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1063.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vidar Kim was a male Human politician from the planet Naboo. Kim served as the Senator of the Chommell sector in the Senate of the Galactic Republic in the 50s BBY, and was the tutor of a young noble boy named Palpatine. Unknown to Kim, Palpatine had been recruited as an apprentice by the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis.
            Senator Kim's eldest son, Ronhar, had been identified as Force-sensitive and turned over to the Jedi Order in his infancy, a choice Senator Kim would later regret before his death. Kim's politics were conservative and isolationist, and he clashed with politicians like Bon Tapalo and Ars Veruna who wished to open Naboo to the wider galaxy. Tragedy struck Kim in 54 BBY when his wife and two children perished in a starship accident over Kaadara. Convinced that his political opponents had been behind his family's deaths to force his retirement, Kim's behaviour became increasingly erratic, attempting to lure Ronhar away from the Jedi Order to rejoin him on Naboo. Identifying the Senator as a liability to the Sith Grand Plan, at the behest of Darth Plagueis Palpatine arranged Kim's assassination in 52 BBY.
            Born on the planet Naboo, the capital world of the Chommell sector, Vidar Kim first tasted politics during his required years of service in the Legislative Youth Program. Becoming the administrative aide of a young female Senator, Kim slowly began his ascent through Naboo politics.[2]
            At some point, Kim met his wife, and was happily married to her for years, fathering three sons, including a Force-sensitive boy named Ronhar Kim. When the Jedi Order approached the family, Kim and his wife parted ways with little Ronhar, sending him to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to be initiated in the ways of the Jedi.[2]
            As a conservative Naboo, Kim garnered the support of House Palpatine's patriarch, Cosinga Palpatine, as both men shared a pro-isolationist stance. Discouraging the bedding of corporate entities who wanted to exploit the rich plasma reserves in the planet's core, Kim did all he could to persuade the monarchy and the Senator to avoid selling their rare resource offworld. As Kim finished his time at the Apprentice Legislator program, he met the eldest son of his supporter, a young boy by the name of Palpatine; Kim took the rebellious youth under his wing and tutored him during his time in the Youth Program. Despite the fact that Palpatine—a strong supporter of Naboo's opening to the galaxy—and his mentor had vastly different political viewpoints, they got along well and were close friends. Vidar once told Palpatine that he was like the younger brother that he had never had.[2]
            Kim's conservative politics and influential backers eventually saw him succeed the outgoing Senator as the Chommell sector's representative in the Galactic Republic's Senate. Kim's isolationist stance saw him clash with King Bon Tapalo over the sale of Naboo's plasma reserves: Tapalo had arranged a deal with the Trade Federation to export Naboo's plasma through it, and Kim saw the deal as unjust and exploitative, pointing out that the Federation sold the plasma on for up to twenty times the price it paid for it. Kim came to feel that he was only kept on as Senator to placate the noble houses of Naboo that had opposed Tapalo in the election of 65 BBY.[2]
            By 54 BBY, Senator Kim was joined in the Senate by his pupil, now ambassador, Palpatine and Kinman Doriana. Unknown to Kim, Palpatine had been taken as the apprentice of the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis. The Muun Sith Lord had ordered Palpatine to deepen his connection to Kim upon hearing that the Senator had sired a Forceful son. Plagueis thought to turn the boy to the dark side of the Force at a future date if it would help further the Grand Plan. Both Kim and Palpatine knew that the younger man would one day replace him in the Senate, and that Kim only continued to serve in the position to appeal to the opponents of the current King Bon Tapalo. During a gala on Malastare in the wake of the Vinta Harvest Classic, Senator Kim and his entourage were in attendance when the Senator received a communiqué from Naboo, revealing the death of his entire family in a airspeeder accident over Kaadara.[2]
            Returning immediately to Naboo, Kim, his entourage and a large throng of mourners gathered at the Funeral Temple in Theed for his family's cremation. The funeral procession was led by King Tapalo into the Temple, where the three bodies were laid upon a massive pyre and reduced to ashes. Walking on foot to the nearby Livet Tower, Senator Kim reflected in silence around the Eternal Flame before giving an emotional farewell to his family, spreading their ashes into the Solleu River and over the Virdugo Plunge.[2]
            Broken by the tragedy, Kim devised a far-fetched plot to lead his only living son, the Jedi Knight Ronhar Kim, away from the Order and to carry on the family lineage. Returning to Coruscant within a month of his family's accident, Kim was angered when his only remaining son refused him, reaffirming his oath to the Jedi Order. Two years past without further communication between the Kims, though the whole affair weighed heavily on the Senator. In 52 BBY, Kim called upon Palpatine to discuss matters of great import at his home in Theed. Detailing his belief that the King and his adviser, Ars Veruna, had arranged the crash to kill his family as a means to make him retire, Kim outlined his plan to reveal the King's corruption to the Jedi High Council. While on Coruscant, Kim had arranged a meeting with his son with the intention of swaying him to his cause and getting him to investigate on Naboo.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vidar_Kim</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVidarKim</string></dict>
        <key>Jai Kell</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1064.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jai Kell was a male human cadet at the Academy for Young Imperials on Lothal fifteen years after the rise of the Galactic Empire. He was known to have a mother, who also lived on Lothal. During his time at the Imperial Academy, he was a member of Unit Aurek which was part of squad LRC077. Kell had an amicable relationship with Zare Leonis and Pandak Symes but did not get along with Nazhros Oleg. While Kell was Force-sensitive, he was unaware of his Force powers that allowed him to excel in his Academy training.
            Later, Unit Aurek was joined by Dev Morgan, who was actually the Force-sensitive rebel and Jedi-in-training Ezra Bridger. Ezra was on a mission to steal a decoder from Imperial Headquarters which contained the location of a kyber crystal shipment. Due to their enhanced physical abilities, Kell and Morgan attracted the attention of the Grand Inquisitor, who ran a secret program known as Project Harvester which identified Force-sensitive individuals. After Bridger learned that the Inquisitor was coming, he and Leonis persuaded a reluctant Kell to escape the Imperial Academy. The Spectres then arranged for Kell and his mother to go into hiding.
            Four years later, Jai, now a member of Ryder Azadi's Lothal resistance, encountered the Spectres once again. They had been sent to Lothal by Rebel Alliance leader Mon Mothma in response to a message from Ryder about a new TIE Defender the Empire was developing on the planet. Jai helped Ezra and Sabine Wren avoid detection and arrest, and later helped the Spectres escape the occupied Jhothal through its sewer system. He later helped recover the hyperdrive of the stolen TIE/D Defender Elite prototype, and assisted in destroying the air defenses placed to defend the Imperial Armory Complex.
            Jai Kell was born and raised on the planet Lothal during the Age of the Empire. During his childhood, he and his family visited Pretor Flats one winter and regarded it as a beautiful place. While he still had a mother, Kell's father had died two years before he had enrolled at the Academy for Young Imperials in Lothal's Capital City. The Academy for Young Imperials was a junior one-year academy that prepared Imperial cadets for training at more specialized senior academies which prepared cadets for a career with the Stormtroopers, the Imperial Army, and the Imperial Navy respectively. Jai joined the Empire with the hope of seeing the wider galaxy and reaching a top rank in the Galactic Empire.[1]
            During his time at the Imperial Academy, Jai was assigned to Unit Aurek, a four-member cell within the cadet squad LRC077. He befriended his fellow Aurek members Zare Leonis and Pandak Symes. However, Jai had an acrimonious relationship with Nazhros Oleg, who was disliked by the other cadets for being selfish and a bully. Unknown to Jai or the other cadets, Leonis was a rebel sympathizer who had infiltrated the Academy to find his missing sister Dhara Leonis, who had disappeared during a field exercise the previous year. Throughout their two-week orientation, Jai and his fellow cadets participated in frequent running drills and field exercises under the supervision of Sergeant Currahee and Lieutenant Chiron. Like his fellow cadets, Jai regarded Currahee as a "witch" because of her fiery temper and even nicknamed her "Curry". Jai also thought that Lieutenant Chiron was "inhuman" due to his incredible running stamina.[1]
            One night, while their fellow cadet Symes was sleeping, Jai caught Oleg "borrowing" Symes' chance cube from his footlocker. When Oleg alleged that Symes had gained the cube by cheating during a game, Jai responded that Symes was not a cheater; prompting Oleg to return the stolen cube. Jai then turned to chat with Leonis about their personal backgrounds. After learning that Leonis was a recent migrant who had been born offworld, Jai asked Oleg where he had come from. Oleg revealed that he had come from the Outer Rim colony world of Eufornis Minor, and added that his ambition was to make it to a senior academy so that he did not have to return to Lothal again, which he dismissed as a "dirtball". Cool-minded, Jai did not take insult at his homeworld being disparaged and instead commented that the seniors would have to wait.[1]
            The following morning, Jai and his fellow cadets were woken up by Sergeant Currahee, who did a footlocker inspection. The tough-minded Currahee found infractions with the entire Unit Aurek and reprimanded Kell and Leonis for leaving dirt on their boots. As punishment, she issued all the cadets in the unit three demerits each. Later that day, Jai's fellow cadet Symes found himself falling behind the other cadets and was regularly berated by Sergeant Currahee. When Leonis attempted to help Symes, Jai tried to advise him that he couldn't since it was not his responsibility.[1]
            As the Orientation period progressed, Jai and his fellow cadets were issued with helmets and E-11 blaster rifles, standard Imperial Military equipment. Near the end of the orientation phase, Jai and his fellow Unit Aurek cadets took part in a training exercise which involved the cadets deploying from a Sentinel-class landing craft into a lake. After disembarking, Jai and the rest of Unit Aurek had to reassemble their rifles before embarking on an obstacle course to reach a pre-set destination. While navigating through the obstacle course, the cadets had to avoid being hit by trainers with their blasters set on stun mode.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jai_Kell</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJaiKell</string></dict>
        <key>Ronhar Kim</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1065.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ronhar Kim was a male Human Jedi Master from Naboo and a General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He was eventually betrayed by his close friend, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, which led to his death.
            A Force-sensitive born on the planet Naboo, Ronhar Kim was one of the three sons of Senator Vidar Kim, who represented their homeworld in the Galactic Senate.[2] Kim was given over to the Jedi Order as an infant, and only returned to Naboo after the deaths of his mother and older brothers in an accident. Having constructed a blue-bladed lightsaber and attained the rank of Jedi Knight, he met with his father who tried to get him to abandon the Order and return to politics on Naboo. Kim lamented the loss of his family members and his father's pain, but stood firmly with the Jedi, saying that they were his family now. His father was furious, and the two didn't talk for two years.[1]
            Some time had passed before the two reunited on Coruscant, and discussed politics while riding aboard an airspeeder in the Coruscant skyline. While they were talking, they were attacked from behind by an assassin on a speeder bike. Senator Kim was immediately killed, while Jedi Kim vaulted from the speeder and knocked the assassin to the ground. Kim attempted to interrogate the assassin, but the being produced a hypodermic needle and injected herself, dying instantly. After his father's death, Kim was the only remaining member of his bloodline.[1]
            Kim attended his father's funeral at the Naboo Embassy on Coruscant, and was there approached by a young man named Palpatine, who had been elected to take Senator Kim's place in the Senate. Kim expressed to Palpatine that perhaps he should have remained on Naboo as his father had asked, and perhaps they both would have had different paths in life. Palpatine in turn told Kim that the Jedi were far more important than any senator, and that he shouldn't regret his decisions. Palpatine then proposed that the two of them could become good friends, and could teach one another about the Jedi and politics in turn.[1]
            Around 32 BBY, after receiving the title of Jedi Master, Kim visited Palpatine in his new office as Supreme Chancellor. Palpatine and Kim joked with one another, and took a walk through the halls of the Senate accompanied by a pair of Senate Guards. They were approached by Senator Viento, who began to discuss the topic of creating a personal guard for Palpatine. The Chancellor pointed out that he already had the Senate Guards protecting him, who ironically then pointed their weapons at him. While they attempted to assassinate the Chancellor, only to be engaged by Kim, who killed one guard and wounded the other. He began to coerce the assassin to answer who he worked for, but just as ten years earlier, the guard injected himself with a poison that instantly killed him. Master Kim connected the two assassination attempts, but still had no answers. While Master Kim deliberated over the implications of this connection, the Jedi Master selected Cerean Initiate Tap-Nar-Pal as his Padawan[1]
            Ten years later, the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems went to war. Forever known as the Clone Wars, the conflict saw Master Kim and his Padawan joining the Grand Army of the Republic as commanding officers, Kim as a General and Pal as a Commander. While most of the Order was unaware of the Sith's involvement in the war, Master Kim had information gleaned from Jedi High Council meetings that there was a mysterious second Sith, the master of Darth Tyranus, otherwise known as Count Dooku. Master Kim, intrigued with the idea, was pleased when Padawan Pal devised a plan to capture the elusive Sith Lord. As the Council believed that the Sith was hidden within the members of the Republic government, Tap-Nar-Pal suggested that they test all the members of the Senate to determine their respective midi-chlorian counts. Whomever had the highest count would clearly be the Sith they sought.[1]
            Kim and his Padawan presented the plan to Chancellor Palpatine within an elegant garden, who immediately rejected the idea as too controversial. He pointed out that some Senators such as Bail Organa of Alderaan would object to the test on principle, but this was not sufficient to dissuade them. Palpatine asked the two Jedi to hold off on suggesting the plan to the High Council until they could discuss it at a later time. Kim said that he and Tap-Nar-Pal were leaving on a simple mission to Merson to battle pirates for a few days, and they would hold off on informing the Council until then.[1]
            Kim quickly mourned the loss of his Padawan, then ordered Dox to engage the droid forces. He told Dox to die well, and the Jedi joined the clones in attacking the battle droids. Kim was gunned down, wounded in several places, and collapsed to the ground. As he died, he realized he had been set up by the second Sith, until a B2 super battle droid shot him in the head, killing him.[1]
            Kim and Tap-Nar-Pal were publicly mourned by Palpatine before the full Galactic Senate. He used their death as an excuse to goad on the war effort and further increase security measures, boosting his own executive power. Just as Palpatine planned, Tap-Nar-Pal's and Kim's idea to expose Darth Sidious died with them.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ronhar_Kim</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRonharKim</string></dict>
        <key>Kreel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1066.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sergeant Kreel, designated Agent 5241, was an undercover stormtrooper and SCAR trooper of the Galactic Empire, serving in the 501st Legion under the direct command of Darth Vader. He operated as the gamemaster in Grakkus the Hutt's arena on Nar Shaddaa. He was tasked with training new candidates to fight in the arena, including Luke Skywalker. During Skywalker's arena fight with Kongo the Disemboweler, Agent 5241 contacted the Empire to inform them that Skywalker was on Nar Shaddaa. After his mission on Nar Shaddaa was complete, Kreel was given command of an elite group of SCAR troopers, designated Task Force 99.
            Kreel was born on Chagar IX. When he was four, Kreel watched a man die. It made him cry like a baby for a dozen more times. Two years later, Kreel watched his own father being murdered in front of him, but he did not cry. His mother was also said to have died in the arenas. He then started to kill people and worked in the fighting pits. Kreel made the fighting pits his way of life in order to survive. Sometime later when Kreel first saw the Galactic Empire's stormtroopers, he viewed them as being beautiful. After the Empire toppled Chagar IX's warlords and shut down the fighting pits, Kreel and his people were given jobs, a sense of purpose, and peace. When he was old enough, Kreel joined the Stormtrooper Corps.[1]
            He then went to the Imperial Academy, where he became friends with a ranger named Izak Anzio of Agamar. During their first mission together, Izak was killed by the Rebels' mortars before their transport landed. Kreel then killed every Rebel he could find that day and vowed to continue doing so.[1] Kreel eventually became a sergeant in the 501st Legion.[5]
            He was then recruited by the Sith Lord, Darth Vader for a deep undercover assignment;[1] to infiltrate Grakkus the Hutt's palace on Nar Shaddaa.[7] He posed as one of Grakkus's greatest fighting slaves that he had bought. In his role, Kreel trained Wookiees, lizard men and space pirates to fight in the arena for Grakkus and his audience.[5] He called himself the "Gamemaster".[3]
            Eventually, he was given Luke Skywalker to train for Grakkus's games. Along with the MagnaGuards, Kreel taught Skywalker how to fight. He spoke with Grakkus and watched as the MagnaGuards fought Skywalker. Later, he was shown the beast that Skywalker would face.[3] Kreel then took Skywalker to the arena to fight Kongo the Disemboweler. Kreel soon contacted a group of TIE/ln space superiority starfighters, informing them that Skywalker was there.[5]
            Kreel triggered Kongo's shock collar and then took out Grakkus's MagnaGuards using a lightsaber. He then arrested Grakkus, telling him that his arena was closed. He was joined by several of the TIE pilots who surrounded Skywalker. However, as they were taking Grakkus and Skywalker, Grakkus initiated an E.M.P. that disabled Kreel's and the TIE pilots guns. Kreel then drew his lightsaber as Kongo was revived. Kreel attempted to subdue Skywalker but was attacked by Grakkus. He ordered the pilots and stormtroopers to capture Skywalker and his allies. Afterwards, Kreel spoke with Vader about Skywalker as he showed the Sith Lord Grakkus' collection of Jedi artifacts.[7]
            Not long after Nar Shaddaa, Kreel was given command of a SCAR trooper squad, Task Force 99.[1] Kreel and the squad then went to Sunspot Prison to find Kolar Ludd. Kreel and his squad were given a new assignment,[8] on the Ghost Moon. There, they were able to shoot down the Rebels' Taylander shuttle. He and his Squad then attacked of the rebel forces, with Kreel destroying a tank with his lightsaber. The attack was successful, with Kreel and his squad capturing Admiral Verette, and interrogating him.[1]
            Kreel then had Verette tied to his shuttle and sent it to the captured Star Destroyer Harbinger as distraction, while he and his SCAR troopers boarded the Harbinger to retake it.[9] Kreel then fought and dueled Skywalker, confirming to Luke that he was the Gamemaster from Grakkus's arena.[10] During the fighting, Kreel was contacted by Vader and was warned not to injure Skywalker- a contact that allowed Skywalker to sense Vader's presence, leaving him distracted. Kreel took advantage of Luke's attempt to use The Force, which he claimed to just get in the way of true fighting skill- but before he could fully overpower the young Jedi, Luke struck out with a Force push that rocked the entire Star Destroyer, trapping Kreel under wreckage and debris. While Luke and the others escaped, Kreel ordered his team to salvage the mission by destroying the Star Destroyer, while he used his lightsaber to cut off his own arm at the shoulder, allowing him to rejoin them as they escaped the ship. While Vader was furious that Kreel and his SCAR team had thoroughly failed in every one of their objectives, Kreel and the Task Force escaped the brunt of his wrath by presenting a valuable captive- the Protocol droid C-3PO.[11]
            Kreel and SCAR Squadron took 3PO to the Devastator where they attempted to interrogate him in order to find the Rebel fleet or any new bases. However, Kreel was ordered to get rid of 3PO by Vader. Despite Vader's orders, Kreel decided to use 3PO as bait to lure the Rebels to them.[12]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kreel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKreel</string></dict>
        <key>Sarro Xaj</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1067.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Sarro Xaj was a Human male Jedi Knight who had a massive physique and studied under Master Raskta Lsu, and fought alongside her in the New Sith Wars on Ruusan. He was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight around 997 BBY and followed in her footsteps, training to become a Jedi Weapon Master.[1]
            Xaj joined Raskta Lsu, Worror Dowmat, Valenthyne Farfalla and Johun Othone on the Justice Crusader to Tython, in pursuit of the Sith Lord Darth Bane and his apprentice Zannah. Once they arrived at Belia Darzu's castle, they immediately engaged in a duel with Darth Bane and Darth Zannah.[1]
            Xaj wielded a blue double-bladed lightsaber nearly three meters long and attacked Zannah in concert with his fellow Jedi Othone. Unfortunately, Othone's lack of skill actually hindered Xaj's efforts. As Xaj pressed his offensive he was interrupted by Othone's basic strikes and was forced to pull up his attacks in order to avoid killing his companion. At one point in the battle, Farfalla called for reinforcements and Xaj shouted for Othone to help him, leaving Xaj to duel Zannah alone. Xaj was able to overpower Zannah in one-on-one combat, using the Force channeled through him by Worror's battle meditation. He exhausted his opponent with his superior strength and drove her back into a corner. As he moved to finish her off, Worror's concentration was broken and his battle meditation cut off, robbing Xaj of the power afforded to him by the Ithorian Jedi Master. Xaj hesitated and glanced toward his companions to see what had happened. Zannah used the opportunity to assault Xaj's mind with Sith sorcery and then killed him with a blow to his chest.[1]
            Following his death on Tython, the Jedi High Council, alerted to the existence of Darth Bane by Caleb of Ambria sent a team of Jedi, including Masters Tho'natu and Obba to destroy him. On Ambria, in Caleb's camp, the Jedi discovered the lightsaber hilts of the slain Jedi, including Xaj's. Upon the team's arrival they were assaulted by a deranged Darovit, whom they assumed to be Bane suffering from overexposure to the orbalisk armor. Slaying him, they deemed that the Sith were extinct, and returned the lightsaber hilts to the Temple.[1]
            Once returned to the Temple, the Jedi created a memorial to those Jedi who were responsible for the destruction of the Sith. All five Jedi's lightsaber hilts were set into a large white stone block in the gardens around the base of the Tower of First Knowledge. Under each hilt was a depiction of its wielder, along with their name.[2]
            Sarro Xaj was a massive man, standing over two meters tall and weighing 150 kilograms. He had olive brown skin and a single topknot of black hair. In his youth, Xaj's passion for lightsaber combat was enough to catch the eye of Weapons Master Raskta Lsu. He was confident in his abilities, humorously speculating that the upcoming battle with the Sith Lords on Tython might be too easy. He even smiled at Zannah in the midst of combat once he was able to engage her in a duel alone, free of the encumbrance of Othone.[1]
            As a Padawan, Xaj chose to follow his master's footsteps in seeking to perfect his skills with a lightsaber. He joined his master in the Ruusan campaign and a few years after the end of the New Sith Wars Lsu completed his training, deeming him worthy of the rank of Jedi Knight. Eventually he earned the rank of Weapons Master. His skill with a double-bladed lightsaber was enough to overwhelm Darth Zannah in one on one combat with the aid of Worror's battle meditation. Zannah described Xaj's fighting style as having more refinement than Bane's. Once the effects were cut off he was distracted and was unable to defend himself from Zannah's Sith sorcery, resulting in his death.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sarro_Xaj</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSarroXaj</string></dict>
        <key>CC-1010</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1068.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>CC-1010, nicknamed "Fox," was a clone trooper commander created from the genetic template of the human bounty hunter Jango Fett. As one of the clone troopers bred for leadership, Fox served as commander of the Coruscant Guard—an elite division of the Grand Army of the Republic, composed of clone shock troopers who were stationed on the Galactic Republic capital world of Coruscant as a domestic security force. A highly decorated and fearless soldier, noted for his sense of duty and honor, Fox lived to serve and protect the members of the Galactic Senate, including their elected leader, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine.
            Fox continued to lead the Coruscant Guard during the early days of the Galactic Empire, the authoritarian government that replaced the Republic by the end of the Clone Wars. However, Fox was ultimately executed by the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who broke the veteran commander's neck by way of the dark side of the Force after the shock troopers opened fire on Vader, having mistook him for a fugitive Jedi.
            CC-1010, a clone who went by the nickname "Fox,"[1] was bred from the genetic material of Jango Fett as part of a program to grow an army on the the planet Kamino.[3] In 22 BBY, approximately one decade after the initial creation of the clone army,[5] Fox and his brethren were called to service by the Galactic Republic, resulting in the formation of the Grand Army of the Republic and the start of the Clone Wars. While thousands of clone troopers served on the front lines under the leadership of the Jedi Order,[3] Fox was stationed on Coruscant where he served as commander of the Coruscant Guard. Under Fox's command, the Guard served as peacekeepers on the Republic capital and were also responsible for the safety of the Galactic Senate as well as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine.[1]
            During the mission to rescue Rotta, son of Jabba Desilijic Tiure, the Hutt crime lord Ziro made Senator Padmé Amidala his prisoner in order to prevent her from exposing his part in Rotta's abduction. She was ultimately liberated by the efforts of Commander Fox and a contingent of clone shock troopers who raided Ziro's establishment in Galactic City, having been informed of the Hutt's illegal actions by Amidala's protocol droid C-3PO. After eliminating the security droids, Fox arrested Ziro who, confessed his betrayal to Jabba[6] before being taken to prison at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center.[7][8]
            The capture of Ziro consequently led to a crisis on Coruscant when a group of senators were taken hostage by several mercenaries, including the bounty hunter Cad Bane. In response, a squad of shock troopers secured the Chancellor's office in the Senate headquarters while Fox and his troops surrounded the detention center to prevent Ziro's escape. In spite of his efforts, Fox was forced to allow the bounty hunters to leave with Ziro in order to save Bane's hostages.[8]
            In 21 BBY, a group of modified demolition droids were sent to disrupt the Confederate–Republic peace initiative on Coruscant. At the time Fox was tasked with protecting the central power distribution grid on Level 5000. The droids deceived him with a security clearance code, which Fox deemed authentic. As a result, the droids completed their mission by destroying power grid, causing a city-wide blackout on Coruscant. Infuriated by the Confederacy's terrorist attack on the galactic capital, the Senate rejected the peace initiative.[9]
            Following the terrorist attack on the Jedi Temple of Coruscant in 19 BBY, Letta Turmond was imprisoned in the Republic Center for Military Operations due to her participation in the attack. Ahsoka Tano, the Jedi Padawan who arrested the terrorist, visited the facility at Turmond's request, but was required to surrender her lightsabers to Commander Fox as a security precaution. Although the clone initially praised Tano for bringing Turmond to justice, he was compelled to arrest her after Turmond was strangled to death by way of the Force. Unknown to Fox,[10] Turmond was murdered by the fallen Jedi Barriss Offee, whose distorted views led her to commit acts of betrayal and terrorism.[11] Offee further tainted her incarcerated comrade's reputation by killing three clone officers with her lightsaber, leading Fox to believe that Tano was the culprit. In response to Tano's escape attempt, Fox deployed the Coruscant Guard alongside Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Clone Captain CT-7567 ("Rex") as they pursued the Jedi escapee.[10]
            In the aftermath of the incident with Tano,[12] whose innocence was proven after Skywalker disrupted her trial to reveal Offee as the real traitor,[13] Fox was ordered to hunt another fugitive—the ARC trooper CT-5555 ("Fives") of the 501st Legion. Fives fled from the Grand Republic Medical Facility where he had attempted to assassinate Chancellor Palpatine after learning of his involvement in a conspiracy to destroy the Jedi Order. Tracking the renegade clone to Level 1315, Fox and a contingent of clone shock troopers confronted Fives, demanding that he stand down. In his panic and desperation, the ARC trooper raised a blaster pistol at the approaching guards, but Fox opened fire, killing Fives with a shot through his heart.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/CC-1010</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCC1010</string></dict>
        <key>Korso</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1069.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Korso was a human male[2] criminal who provided muscle for Tobias Beckett's gang. On the planet Mimban, he disguised himself in stolen Imperial swamp trooper armor, an Imperial fleet trooper helmet, and an Imperial officer greatcoat.[3] He helped Beckett to infiltrate the Imperial Army in exchange for passage off Mimban. He was killed by a Mimbanese during the Mimban campaign.[1]
            Korso was played by New Zealand actor John Tui in the 2018 Star Wars Anthology film Solo: A Star Wars Story.[4] According to screenwriter Jon Kasdan, Tui's performance was great, but given the hectic environment of the scene, it became confusing to introduce Korso as he was going to immediately get killed off, likely hinting that Korso was featured in deleted scenes. The character's original logic, as a larger man, was that Beckett's gang had lost their muscle and Beckett saw Chewbacca as a useful replacement.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korso</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascKorso</string></dict>

During the Battle of Christophsis, Spark formed part of the clone crew aboard the Republic stealth ship, where he served under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Clone Commander Blackout.
            Spark was drafted in as a crew member of the stealth ship after one of its original members was killed. Despite originally being told that they were to deliver vital supplies to Senator Bail Organa on the surface of Christophsis, the plan soon changed when General Anakin Skywalker chose to attack Admiral Trench's command ship directly. The crew of the stealth ship were able to then destroy Trench's cruiser, allowing the delivery of supplies to the planet's surface. After they arrived, Spark was told that he was now officially part of the stealth ship crew.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/CT-1284</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCT1284</string></dict>
        <key>CT-1409</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1071.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>CT-1409—nicknamed "Echo"—was a clone trooper who served the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Born on Kamino, Echo was originally identified as CT-21-0408, a cadet of the Domino Squad along with his friends, Hevy, Cutup, Droidbait and Fives, before he graduated from the clone training center. On his first assignment after graduating, Echo was tasked with guarding the Rishi Station moon base, where he, along with Fives and the Clone Captain Rex, aided in warning the Republic of an impending Separatist attack on Kamino. Echo was commended for his bravery and absorbed into the 501st Legion.
            After the attack on the Rishi moon, Echo defended his homeworld from Separatist forces as they attacked Tipoca City, where they sought to destroy the Republic's cloning facilities. Once the 501st successfully repelled the attack, Echo and Fives were both promoted to the elite rank of ARC trooper. Echo was later tasked with a mission to Lola Sayu, where he and the 501st were to retrieve coordinates to the Nexus Route from the Jedi Master Even Piell, who had been imprisoned on Lola Sayu's Citadel. Despite Piell's death during the mission, it was ultimately a success, but Echo was seemingly killed when trying to secure an escape.
            The severely injured Echo was taken prisoner by Separatists forces, where he was sold to the foreman of the Techno Union, Wat Tambor. Echo was kept alive by being turned into a cyborg, albeit at the cost of his consciousness. He became an unwitting pawn for the Separatists during their campaign on Anaxes, led by the Admiral Trench. When Rex found traces of Echo's survival, he, accompanied by Clone Force 99 and the Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, led a mission to rescue Echo on Skako Minor. They succeeded, and, in turn, Echo used his cybernetic capabilities to turn the tide against the Separatists on Anaxes, leading to the Republic's victory.
            CT-1409 was born on the planet Kamino, as all the clone troopers of the Galactic Republic were.[1] He sarcastically[3] received the nickname "Echo" for having a tendency to repeat orders during training exercises, annoying his fellow troopers. Echo lived in the barracks of Tipoca City, where he endured physical and mental training, and was identified by the designation CT-21-0408 as a cadet. Like all clones, Echo was a genetic copy of the once renowned bounty hunter Jango Fett, although, due to the millions of clones straining what DNA was left of the deceased Fett, it was speculated by the Kaminoan Administrator Lama Su that Echo, along with the other cadets in his unit, was too deficient to be a soldier.[1]
            During one of their final training exercises, Echo and Domino Squad—the cadets CT-4040 "Cutup", CT-00-2010 "Droidbait", CT-5555 "Fives", and CT-782 "Hevy"—had failed to work together on the field, causing them to fight amongst each other. Echo insisted that the squad simply follow orders to pass their training, for which he was mocked by Hevy as the squad cast blame for the failure on each other. The string of recent disappointments by Domino Squad caused their trainers—the Togruta Jedi Shaak Ti, the Siniteen Bric, and the Arcona El-Les—to grow concerned about their chances of successfully being inducted into the Grand Army of the Republic. Shaak Ti observed that Echo had issues adapting to the battlefield, as he was too busy trying to impose the rules of the exercise on his squad-mates, and Bric wanted to flatly abandon the whole squad.[1]
            Soon after, the ARC trooper Colt visited the cadets with the intention of pitting them against their final test. On the mock-battlefield, Echo and Domino Squad were expected to face nonlethal battle droids and climb to the top of a citadel. However, the squad was unable to work together yet again, automatically failing the test when they chose to leave an injured Droidbait behind. Colt reprimanded Echo and the others for breaking the most important rule of working as one. Following their failure, Echo and Fives requested a transfer to Bravo Squad, a group that had easily passed the citadel challenge, as they were unable to cooperate with the rest of team. Shaak Ti denied their request, insisting the clones reassess their teamwork before they take on their last chance at the final challenge.[1]
            The next day, Echo and Domino Squad went into the challenge with a renewed inspiration; Hevy had received encouragement from the malformed clone 99, a member of the maintenance crew, while Cutup had proved resilient when Bric tried to goad him into a fight. Echo and his team coherently made their way through the battle droids on the battlefield, making it to the citadel without trouble. However, they were unable to conventionally scale the tower when they realized their ascension cables were not with them, having been removed by Bric beforehand without their knowledge. In a surprise to Bric, the clone cadets managed to strategize and used the citadel's blaster cannons to scale the tower after neutralizing them, leading to their success. Shaak Ti, in that moment, believed the squad to be one of the best she had ever seen. Echo and the other members of Domino Squad henceforth became clone troopers, and were sent on their first deployment to partake in the Clone Wars.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/CT-1409</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCT1409</string></dict>
        <key>Daric LaRone</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1072.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Daric LaRone was a Human male stormtrooper born on the planet Copperline. He had two younger brothers. While serving on the Reprisal, LaRone became unsatisfied with service to the New Order after being ordered to massacre civilians on Teardrop. Confronted by Imperial Security Bureau Major Drelfin over his tacit refusal to kill the civilians, he was forced to murder Drelfin in self-defense. He and fellow stormtroopers Korlo Brightwater, Taxtro Grave, Saberan Marcross, and Joak Quiller took an ISB-modified Suwantek TL-1800, the Gillia, and fled, intending to go the Outer Rim Territories.
            However, still feeling compelled by their duty to Imperial citizens, LaRone led the group in a number of vigilante actions on Drunost and Janusar, with LaRone christening them the Hand of Judgment. Later, he and his four comrades met up with Rebellion heroes Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca and they managed to work out a mutual working relationship between the Rebels and ex-stormtroopers. LaRone and the group ended up on Shelkonwa, where they helped Mara Jade eliminate treasonous Governor Barshnis Choard. After learning the identity of him and his men, Jade let them go and the five stormtroopers made their way across the galaxy intent on aiding other Imperial citizens.
            LaRone and his ex-stormtrooper companions continued their vigilante actions, eliminating small-time warlords and forcing the resignation of a small-time administrator. Their actions were monitored by Jade, who decided to enlist their assistance in infiltrating the palace of Governor Bidor Ferrouz, who was suspected of treason, on Poln Major. With little other choice but to lend their aid, LaRone and his men helped Jade breach the palace security, only to encounter Luke Skywalker again shortly afterward. Skywalker became embroiled in a plot by a local warlord, Nuso Esva, to seize control of the system after pitting the Rebel Alliance and Empire against each other, and LaRone and his stormtroopers helped rescue him. When Jade caught wind of the plot, she rescued Ferrouz and Rebel ambassador named Vestin Axlon and gave them a temporary reprieve while they deal with Esva. She entrusted the two to LaRone and his men and they hunkered down in an abandoned tapcafe to hold off attacks from Esva's people, several of whom had already infiltrated Ferrouz's palace staff.
            However, Axlon proved traitorous and, though LaRone and some local Troukree allies they had acquired were able to deal with him, they soon faced waves of attackers in the employ of Esva. LaRone and his men put up a valiant defense, fending off the onslaught. After the attackers were defeated and Esva's forces in orbit defeated by a newly-arrived Imperial fleet, LaRone and his companions were taken by the Troukree to meet their employer. That individual turned out to be Senior Captain Thrawn, who recruited them to train an indigenous force of stormtroopers from worlds sympathetic to the Empire that were located in the Unknown Regions.
            In 18 BBY, LaRone watched as the new Imperial Military came to cleanse his homeworld Copperline of the pirates who had plagued it for decades. In 10 BBY, when Imperial recruiters showed up, he enlisted as a Imperial Army with the call number TKR 330, not wanting to become a poor farmer like the rest of Copperline's residents. Three years later, he was accepted in the Stormtrooper Corps. He enjoyed the first six years of duty, until his service on worlds such as Elriss and Bompreil had made him doubt his loyalty. The turning point for him came when the planet Alderaan was destroyed, and he was ordered to kill civilians during a raid on Teardrop in 0.5 ABY, while stationed as part of the stormtrooper contingent aboard the Reprisal. LaRone was hesitant to open fire on the civilians and was horrified at the deaths that were caused.[1]
            Returning to Reprisal, LaRone was later confronted by Imperial Security Bureau Major Drelfin, who initially criticized him for not following regulations. Once Drelfin realized that LaRone had disregarded orders on Teardrop, though, the ISB officer grew more agitated and was intent on executing LaRone. In response, LaRone disarmed and slew Drelfin with his own blaster. The other stormtroopers who witnessed the event—Saberan Marcross, Taxtro Grave, Joak Quiller, and Korlo Brightwater, along with LaRone—realized that not only were their careers in the military over, but their lives would probably also be taken in any subsequent investigation, stole the Gillia, a Suwantek TL-1800 that had been specially modified by the ISB, and fled Reprisal. To facilitate their escape, they used ISB codes on the ship and pretended to be ISB operatives leaving Reprisal on a secret mission. Exploring the ship, the ex-stormtroopers soon found that the ship was stocked with weapons, several sets of stormtrooper armor, scouttrooper armor and even a spacetooper suit. Also onboard were credits, equipment for forging identities and even a pair of speeder bikes.[1]
            Journeying to Drunost in their stolen ship, the five ex-stormtroopers landed, in search of food stores and other supplies, with LaRone as the unofficial leader. LaRone and Grave were able to purchase their supplies and were returning to the ship when a group of farmers they were traveling alongside came under attack by a swoop gang. LaRone and Grave held them off with hand blasters, until Brightwater, Marcross, and Quiller arrived with vehicles and heavier weapons, handily defeating them. Unbeknownst to them, they were helping to protect a supply of arms being transported by the Rebel Alliance. Leaving the scene, they boarded their ship and left for Janusar to obtain spare parts for their speeders, as well as fuel for the ship.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Daric_LaRone</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDaricLaRone</string></dict>
        <key>Malleus</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1073.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Malleus, who was originally known as Telloti Cillmam'n, was a Force-sensitive Human male from Taanab. Born during the last years of the Galactic Republic, he was detected by the Jedi Order at a young age and sent to be trained at the Jedi Temple of Coruscant as a member of the Boma Clan of Initiates. At the age of thirteen, he fought in the Apprentice Tournament to attract the attention of a potential Jedi Master. Failing to be selected, he was subsequently deemed too old to become a Padawan learner. As was customary, he was forced to join the ranks of the Exploration Corps instead.
            In 19 BBY, after seven years of service in the Corps, Cillmam'n was dispatched to Nicht Ka with Master Ekim Ryelli and Staguu Itincoovar. Once there, he found the armor and lightsaber of the ancient Dark Jedi Warb Null. After donning the armor, Cillmam'n was flooded with visions that made him turn to the dark side. Carried away by his newfound power, he dueled Ryelli, whom he ended up killing by decapitation, and, after disposing of Itincoovar as well, he left the planet. Now a Dark Jedi himself, Cillmam'n assumed the identity of Malleus, the Hammer of the Dark Side.
            A native of the agriworld of Taanab[1] in the Inner Rim of the galaxy[3] the Human male Telloti Cillmam'n was born in 39 BBY, during the waning decades of the Galactic Republic. He was keenly atuned to the Force,[1] a mystical energy field that sprung from all lifeforms.[4] The infant's potential attracted the attention of the Jedi Order,[1] an ancient order of protectors unified by their belief and observance of the Force.[4] As was traditional among the Jedi,[5] Cillmam'n was taken from his family to undergo training on the planet Coruscant, capital of the Republic and seat of the Jedi Order.[1]
            He grew up in the Jedi Temple, where he was sorted in the Boma Clan—one of several groupings of Jedi Initiates that were designed to appeal to the traits of their members. His classmates included another male Human, Lumas Etima, with whom the Taanab-born youngling would later develop a rivalry.[1] As all members of the Boma Clan, Cillmam'n[1] enjoyed the personal attention of Yoda, the Grand Master of the Order, who gave them lightsaber instructional courses.[6] Like most Jedi initiates, he did not remember anything about his parents or homeworld. As a child, he maintained good relations with Even Piell and Jocasta Nu, both senior Jedi Masters, who would tell him tales of the Jedi clashing with Sith Lords in the days of old. Piell's stories in particular thrilled the young Human, who began to dream that he too would be remembered in history.[1]
            As was custom in the Order, an initiate had to attract the attention of a Jedi Master and become a Padawan learner when he or she achieved the age of thirteen. Otherwise, he or she would be considered too old to proceed in his or her advanced training.[6] In 26 BBY, Cillmam'n participated in the Jedi Temple's annual lightsaber tournament as part of the Apprentice Trials. He hoped that, by exhibiting his combat skills and Force talents, he would be able to catch a Master's eye. During the tournament, Cillmam'n bested most of his fellow younglings, including Lumas Etima. In spite of that, no Jedi Master claimed him as Padawan. On top of that, Cillmam'n bitterly witnessed Etima, whom he had dueled and defeated, being chosen by Master Ekim Ryelli. Like many other washouts, he was transferred by the Council of Reassignment to the Exploration Corps, a branch of the Jedi Service Corps, where his talents would be used for archaeology and scouting rather then defending the galaxy with a lightsaber. Meanwhile, the teaching relationship between Ryelli and Etima was cut short when the Clone Wars broke out in 22 BBY. While the two were fighting the battle droids of the Separatist Droid Army on Geonosis, the apprentice ended up being killed whereas the master lost three fingers on his left hand. That traumatic incident reinforced Cillmam'n's opinion that he should have been chosen instead of Etima. As for Ryelli, he retired from combat and became a Jedi archaeologist.[1]
            From 26 to 19 BBY, Cillmam'n piloted a Pathfinder scout vessel in the Exploration Corps, although he did it with lingering bitterness and disappointment. In 19 BBY, while the Clone Wars were drawing to a close, Cillmam'n was tasked with accompanying Master Ryelli to Nicht Ka, an ammonia-washed world located on the border of the ancient Sith Empire, along with the Givin astrogator Staguu Itincoovar. Once the Jedi explorers had set foot into the ruins, the archaeologist started examining a few peculiar carvings on the walls. After sending Itincoovar back to their ship so he could do some philological research and help decipher the carvings, Ryelli allowed Cillmam'n to look around the place in the mean time. In another room, the young pilot came across a antique armor that had once belonged to Warb Null,[1] Dark Jedi and metallurgist extraordinaire, whose brief reign of terror had been ended by the Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma in 3998 BBY.[7] The suit was complete, except for the missing right glove, and came with a special, long-handle lightsaber. Feeling a strange fascination for that artefact, Cillmam'n put on the entire suit of armor, and was instantly flooded with visions and voices of the ancient Sith history. With the strength of that armor, the young man thought he could bring an end to the Clone Wars on his own by killing Dooku, leader of the Separatist Confederacy that fought against the Republic.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malleus</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMalleus</string></dict>
        <key>Malorum</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1074.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Malorum was a Human male who became one of the first members of the Inquisitorius during the time following the formation of the Galactic Empire.
            Tall and imposing, Malorum wore a dark maroon robe similar to that worn by Emperor Palpatine.[2] Malorum was slightly Force-sensitive, though he was never recruited by the Jedi.[3]
            Malorum initially worked as an Imperial Intelligence operative, and along with Director Armand Isard, visited the Jedi Temple in the aftermath of Order 66. There, he saw a hologram of Emperor Palpatine addressing Anakin Skywalker as Lord Vader. Thus, Malorum was one of a few in the Empire—along with Prince Xizor, two decades later—who knew Vader's true identity, although Vader and Palpatine were unaware of this fact.[1]
            Following the incident, Malorum was plucked out of obscurity by Palpatine, who revealed that he was a Sith and placed Malorum in charge of the Inquisitorius.[2] He was assisted by a lower Inquisitor, Hydra.[4] Subsequently, Malorum made it his business to discover everything he could about Skywalker, through bribes and surveillance, and digging into what had happened months before.[2] He learned that Skywalker was the father of Senator Amidala's (presumed deceased) child. He employed Boba Fett to investigate Naboo and the asteroid field of Polis Massa, searching for information about the late Padmé Amidala.[2] Malorum acted on his own initiative, hoping to ingratiate himself with Vader, while at the same time obtaining information to bring about his downfall. He became known as Vader's "pet" through his investigations in Vader's name. Malorum, however, wanted to replace Vader as the Emperor's apprentice,[3] and planned to become Emperor himself one day.[1]
            Eventually, Malorum was reassigned to Bellassa, where he worked as the chief of security, training Imperial Security Bureau agents on the planet. Malorum became obsessed with hunting down the escaped fugitive and ex-Jedi Ferus Olin, enlisting the help of bounty hunters such as Boba Fett and D'harhan to help crush the Rebel uprising on Bellassa.[2]
            The ghost of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn then instructed his former Padawan, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, to help Olin; because while doing so, Kenobi would learn that Malorum was investigating Polis Massa and thus Kenobi would learn about the importance of stopping Malorum before the Skywalker twins could be discovered. Olin managed to escape Bellassa with the help of Kenobi.[2] For a time, Kenobi overestimated the influence and power of Malorum, believing him to be directly behind the Inquisitorius operations in Acherin. Although Kenobi returned soon afterward to his self-imposed exile in Tatooine, he ordered Olin to deal with the threat of Malorum.[5]
            Malorum was then assigned to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. He set up his office in the former living quarters of Jedi Master Yoda. While in the Jedi Temple, he was paid a visit by Darth Vader. Malorum told Vader all he knew about Polis Massa, hoping to please Vader. However, when Vader heard the name of the place, he grew furious at this reminder of his dead wife, and he nearly killed Malorum.[3] The unexpected discovery of an intruder in the Temple led to Vader freeing Malorum so that the Inquisitor could track him, but to Vader's surprise, Malorum failed.[6]
            Later, Malorum set a sleeper bomb in the Temple. His goal was to destroy the Temple and disgrace Vader in the Emperor's eyes. The bomb, however, was deactivated by Ferus Olin, Trever Flume, and Fy-Tor-Ana. When stormtroopers captured Ferus, they interrogated him and asked him the name of the Jedi Ferus met on Bellassa. Ferus refused to talk, despite threats of execution.[3]
            Malorum sent Ferus to the prison world of Dontamo, and later ordered his execution. He then visted Naboo to learn more about Amidala. Malorum's time on Naboo was frustrating, with Queen Apailana and other Naboo politicians refusing to give him a straight answer[1] — he particularly found the Queen's attitude exasperating.[7] Malorum then killed Ryoo Thule after deducing that Amidala's child still lived, but was stopped by Ferus Olin before he could report this information. Malorum and Ferus faced off in a vicious lightsaber duel on Naboo. In the end, Malorum lost grip of his lightsaber and fell to his death into the Naboo power generator.
            Although Olin had jammed the planetary communications, Palpatine knew of Malorum's death in a matter of moments, and contacted Olin to congratulate him for his success and make him an offer, before Olin could report to Kenobi.[1]
            Malorum was considered introverted, unpleasant, and not likable at all; his assistant Hydra shared these traits to a greater level.[8]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malorum</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMalorum</string></dict>
        <key>Ahlan Matale</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1075.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ahlan Matale was a Human male living on Dantooine during the Jedi Civil War. He was native to the Core Worlds, but moved to Dantooine to get his family away from the crowded bustle of city life. He soon became one of the most successful plantation owners on Dantooine, and was arguably the most powerful man on Dantooine; until the arrival of the Sandrals. Ahlan and Nurik Sandral developed a heated rivalry, and grew an immense dislike of each other. Ahlan's hatred of the Sandrals caused him to become overly possessive of his son. After his son disappeared, Ahlan immediately suspected Nurik, and the two families came dangerously close to feuding, until the local Jedi Council intervened.
            Dissatisfied with the crowded core worlds, Ahlan Matale decided to move his family to the distant rural world of Dantooine. Ahlan used his own finances to buy an estate, and took up farming.[1]
            Shortly after his move, however, another family moved to Dantooine from the core worlds, the Sandrals. Ahlan did not like Nurik, the leader of the Sandral family, and convinced himself that Nurik had followed him to Dantooine to steal his wealth. Ahlan spread his hatred onto his son, to ensure that the Sandrals would face the full force of Matale hatred.[1]
            Over time, the Matales and the Sandrals developed a heated rivalry, fighting over land and so forth. The many arguments between Ahlan and Nurik sometimes came to the brink of open warfare between the two families. On one instance, Ahlan detected a battalion of Sandral droids on his estate. Assuming that the Sandrals were most likely attempting to assassinate him or spy out the ways of his estate in preparation of an invasion, Ahlan sent his own battalion of droids to destroy the "invaders". In truth, Nurik was simply searching for his son Casus.[1]
            A few weeks later, Ahlan's son, Shen, disappeared. Ahlan was certain that Nurik was responsible. However, he was not totally willing to invade the Sandrals just yet, fearing that they might harm Shen in retaliation. So, instead, Ahlan went to the Jedi, who had established a secret enclave on Dantooine. However, Ahlan grew impatient waiting for the Jedi to act, and threatened to attack the Sandral estate if the Jedi did not act.[1]
            Finally, the Jedi Council of the Dantooine Enclave sent a amnesiac Revan to investigate. Ahlan was frustrated that even the Padawan wasted time he thought would be better used searching the Sandral estate. Instead, Revan insisted on questioning Ahlan about the families' history with each other. Ahlan decided to attempt to motivate the Jedi Padawan with credits, much to the chagrin of Revan, who politely informed Ahlan that Jedi could not be bought with credits. Eventually, Revan left for the Sandral estate.[1]
            Eventually, Ahlan grew tired of waiting for Revan to conclude his investigation, and took a pair of droids to the Sandral estate, to take matters into his own hands. Upon arriving at the front gate, Ahlan discovered Revan with Shen, who had indeed been imprisoned by Nurik, and also with Rahasia Sandral, Nurik's daughter.[1]
            Although briefly relieved at the sight of his son, Ahlan was quickly overtaken by rage when he realized that Shen was in fact in love with Rahasia. The unhappy reunion was interrupted when Nurik, upon realizing Shen's escape, took a pair of droids to confront Ahlan. Nurik accused Ahlan of kidnapping his son Casus, to which Ahlan profusely denied. Nurik also criticized Rahasia for fraternizing with the "Matale dog", meaning Shen. Ahlan was outraged at this last remark, and the two men came close to opening fire on each other, were it not for Revan, who pleaded with Ahlan and Nurik, and begged them to allow their children to bypass their feud and join their lives. Ahlan initially refused and ordered Shen to come back to the estate with him. Nurik however suggested that they comply with Revan, and pointed out that they had nearly ruined their children's lives with their over-possessiveness.[1]
            Ahlan was uncertain, but eventually conceded to his son's love for Rahasia. He and Nurik then agreed to buy their children their own house.[1]
            While it is uncertain if Ahlan escaped the Sith invasion of Dantooine, but seeing as how several wealthy settlers were rumored to escape Dantooine, while others were executed, and Ahlan's estate was preserved and used as the post-invasion center of government, Khoonda, it is likely that Ahlan survived.[1] But Terena Adare said the Matales were all "removed" from Dantooine, so it is possible he was killed when the Sith invaded.
            Ahlan was notoriously impatient and impulsive. Although he was correct about his assumption that Nurik kidnapped Shen, it was nevertheless viewed by many as an unfounded conclusion. Ahlan also looked down on those who were not wealthy, and possessed the belief that his wealth made him superior to everyone else. He also viewed those who were wealthy like him with dislike and suspicion, as he did with the Sandrals. Ahlan was also a little paranoid as a result of his feud with Nurik, and never left his home without a contingent of droid bodyguards.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ahlan_Matale</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAhlanMatale</string></dict>
        <key>Martio Batch</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1076.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Martio Batch was an Imperial officer who rose through the ranks to become one of the twelve Grand Admirals of the Galactic Empire appointed by Emperor Palpatine during an elaborate New Year's Fete Week ceremony two years before the Battle of Yavin. Batch disliked the Imperial court politics that his fellow Grand Admirals reveled in, and as a result of his low profile, he earned the nickname the "invisible admiral." Following the Imperial defeat at the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, the Emperor tasked Batch with designing a fool-proof cloaking device that would catch the Rebel Alliance off-guard and ensure the Empire's ultimate victory. Batch spent years aboard the Imdaar Alpha research station trying to develop the cloaking device, using hibridium to develop an experimental cloak. His efforts, however, suffered from a fatal flaw; while the cloaked ship would be invisible, the pilot would be unable to see out.
            Around 3 ABY, Batch abandoned his hibridium-based design and attempted to recreate the successful stygium cloaking screen used in cloaked ships in the past. Batch diverted the Empire's new Tarkin superweapon to the planet Aeten II, where the stygium crystals required for the cloak had been mined before the supply ran dry, and used the weapon's powerful superlaser to shatter the planet, releasing millions of free-floating crystals from the planet's core. Now that he had crystals at his disposal, the Grand Admiral easily recreated the stygium screen, and the Empire began fitting modified V38 assault fighters with the technology. Following extensive testing, Batch's new cloaked TIE phantoms were soon ordered into full production. However, the Rebel Alliance had discovered the project. During an operation to acquire one of the TIE phantoms, the Rebels managed to destroy the Imdaar Alpha research facility, as well as all the cloaked fighters and the cloaking technology in the process. Batch survived the attack and fled to the Outer Rim Territories with his remaining ships. However, his crew soon turned on him, assassinating the Grand Admiral before joining renegade Warlord Harrsk's new splinter kingdom in the Deep Core.
            Martio Batch, a Human male, was an officer of the Galactic Empire who rose to prominence and became one of the twelve Grand Admirals appointed by Emperor Palpatine during an elaborate New Year's Fete Week ceremony two years before the Battle of Yavin. Unlike his fellow Grand Admirals, Batch had a distaste for Imperial court politics and made fewer public appearances, earning him the nickname the "invisible admiral."[3][4]
            After the loss of the Death Star at the hands of the Rebel Alliance at the Battle of Yavin,[5] the Emperor tasked Batch with designing a fool-proof cloaking device.[3] The loss at Yavin had enraged the Imperial command, leading them to seek a weapon that would ensure the Empire's ultimate victory over the Rebels.[6] Palpatine considered Batch an ideal candidate to lead the secret development project due to his low profile.[3]
            Batch spent years aboard the Imdaar Alpha research station trying to develop the cloaking device. The devices had once been common, operating on stygium crystals mined from the planet Aeten II in the Dreighton Nebula. Eventually, the Aeten II mines ran dry and cloaking technology became increasingly rare.[3] While conducting research into alternatives to stygium, Batch contributed a section titled "What You Don't See: Cloaking Devices" describing cloaking devices to the Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide, the official military guidebook of the Empire.[7]
            Using hibridium as an alternative, Batch developed an experimental cloak, but it suffered from a fatal flaw; while the cloaked ship would be invisible, the pilot would be unable to see out.[3] Around 3 ABY, Batch attempted to recreate the stygium cloaking screen that had been successful in the past, abandoning the hibridium-based cloaking technology.[1] Batch came upon success when he pulled rank[4] to divert the Empire's new Tarkin superweapon, a stripped-down version of the Death Star, to Aeten II. Using the weapon's powerful superlaser, Batch shattered Aeten II, releasing millions of free-floating crystals from the planet's core.[3] This was the Tarkin's only offensive action before it was destroyed by a Rebel strike team at Patriim.[8]
            Now that he had the necessary crystals at his disposal, the Grand Admiral easily recreated the stygium screen used long ago. Under Batch's command,[3] the Empire began fitting modified V38 assault fighters with the technology at the facility on Imdaar Alpha, with the aim of producing a fleet of the cloaked starfighters. In addition to the stygium, the fighters required a supply of oridium fuel, and the Empire established a mining facility in the Belt of Arah to extract and process the ore.[6] To protect his investment, Batch requisitioned the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Terror, under the command of Admiral Sarn.[3] Both the Terror and the Imdaar Alpha facility were also fitted with the cloaking technology.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Martio_Batch</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMartioBatch</string></dict>
        <key>Mart Mattin</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1077.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Mart Mattin was the nephew of Commander Jun Sato and the leader of Iron Squadron. After his father died, Mart took over leadership of the squadron. The Iron Squadron became the only rebel cell on the planet Mykapo and harassed Imperial forces there.
            In 2 BBY, the Empire imposed martial law on Mykapo and dispatched an advance patrol there. The Iron Squadron's YT-2400 light freighter Sato's Hammer was attacked by the Imperial patrol. With the help of the Spectres and Phoenix Cell, the Iron Squadron managed to wipe out the patrol. Mart declined Hera Syndulla's advice to leave the system.
            While his crew left with the Spectres, Mart took on Imperial reinforcements led by Admiral Kassius Konstantine. His ship sustained damaged during the skirmish and Mart was forced to send a distress transmission to the Spectres. The Spectres and his Iron Squadron comrades rescued him with the help of his uncle Commander Jun Sato. Mart and his crew then joined the rebellion.
            Mart Mattin lived on the planet Mykapo during the Age of the Empire with his father[1] and mother.[4] His father was the leader of a rebel cell called the Iron Squadron, which consisted of the Theelin Gooti Terez, the human Jonner Jin, and the astromech droid R3-A3. These rebels operated from a YT-2400 light freighter called Sato's Hammer. At some point, Mart's father was killed during a clash with Imperial forces. Mart took over leadership of the Iron Squadron and did not maintain contact with his uncle Jun Sato, the commander of the Phoenix Cell. Mart and his fellow Iron Squadron members regarded Mykapo as their home and harassed Imperial forces there.[1]
            In 2 BBY, the Empire decided to impose martial law on Mykapo. They dispatched an advance patrol, consisting of a Gozanti-class cruiser and several TIE fighters to lock down the system. Mart's Iron Squadron clashed with the Imperial patrol and sustained damage to their ship's hyperdrive. Shortly later, Hera Syndulla and her Spectres along with Phoenix Squadron arrived to evacuate rebel sympathizers on Mykapo. They came to the aid of Iron Squadron by attacking the Imperial fighters. Hera contacted the Iron Squadron and told them that they needed to evacuate the system. Mart thanked the rebels for their help but declined their offer of assistance. When Hera reiterated her warning, Mart replied that the Iron Squadron did not run. He then flew the Sato's Hammer towards the Gozanti cruiser and dropped several explosive cargo pieces which destroyed the Imperial ship.[1]
            Following the skirmish, Mart chatted with Hera via the intercom and invited her and her crew aboard the Sato's Hammer. Hera's ship Ghost docked with the Sato's Hammer and Mart's crew entertained Hera and her rebel comrades Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, and the astromech droid Chopper. Mart met with the Spectres in his ship's cockpit and acknowledged that he was Commander Sato's nephew. When Mart asked Hera if his uncle had sent him, Hera replied that she and her fellow rebels had come to evacuate rebel dissidents from Mykapo. Mart rejected any idea of evacuating Mykapo as cowardice and remarked that he could hold off the Empire. When Hera warned them that the Empire would return, Mart responded that he and his crew had just destroyed a Star Destroyer; mistaking the Gozanti cruiser for one. In the end, Mart and his crew decline Hera's offer to leave and reiterated that they would defend Mykapo from the Empire.[1]
            Despite the unsuccessful meeting, Ezra persuaded Hera to let him, Sabine, and Chopper stay behind to repair the Iron Squadron's hyperdrive. Ezra was still determined to win over the squadron. Hera reluctantly sanctioned his mission but warned the rebels that they needed to leave at the first sign of Imperial activity. Mart and his crew allowed Sabine and Chopper to assist R3-A3 with the repairs. However, he still thought that it was a waste of time. Sabine and the droids managed to repair the hyperdrive. However, their efforts came to naught because Mart redirected the power to the armaments and deflector shields. Upon sighting Imperial reinforcements, Mart ordered his crew to their battle stations. This second Imperial force was commanded by Admiral Kassius Konstantine and consisted of an Arquitens-class command cruiser and two more Gozanti cruisers.[1]
            Despite the odds stacked against the Iron Squadron, Mart refused to back down and flew the Sato's Hammer towards Konstantine's forces. Ezra and Sabine disagreed and managed to convince Gooti, Jonner, and R3-A3 to accompany them into their shuttle, Phantom II. When the ship's power broke down, Mart saw reason and accompanied the rebels aboard the Phantom II. Once everyone else had gone aboard, Mart stayed behind and disengaged the airlock. Changing his mind, Mart launched a frontal attack on Konstantine's light cruiser. However, the Admiral neutralized his explosives by unleashing his frontal batteries. Mart attempted to flee but the Sato's Hammer's engines were knocked out by TIE fighters. Trapped, Mart then told the Spectres and his crew to flee without him.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mart_Mattin</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascMartMattin</string></dict>
        <key>Jai Maruk</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1078.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jai Maruk was a male Human Jedi Master who served the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars, at which time he wielded a sky blue lightsaber.
            Jai Maruk was a male Human native from the planet Druckenwell, and was nicknamed "the Hawk-bat." He was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant at some point in his early years for Jedi training, and had attained the rank of Jedi Master by the time the Clone Wars occurred.
            After returning from a costly mission on Vjun, where he lost a lightsaber duel against the Separatist-aligned Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress, Maruk was allowed to return to Coruscant by Count Dooku in order to lure Grand Master Yoda into a trap.
            While eating his meal in the dining hall of the Jedi Temple, Maruk expressed his feelings about how one certain youngling, Tallisibeth Enwandung-Esterhazy, should be sent to the Agricultural Corps because of her apparent lack of the Force. Yoda made a bet with Maruk, that if Esterhazy were to win the fighting competition, he would have to take her as his Padawan learner. After watching Enwandung-Esterhazy defeat all other competition, Maruk hesitantly took her as his Padawan.
            On a secret return mission to Vjun to confront Count Dooku, Master Maruk, Yoda, Master Maks Leem, Enwandung-Esterhazy, and Whie Malreaux were attacked by Ventress on Phindar. In a hard-fought rematch which nearly caused Maruk to turn to the dark side of the Force, Maruk was fatally slashed on the abdomen by Ventress. His Padawan clambered to his side and begged him not to leave her and, with his last breath, Maruk promised that he never would.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jai_Maruk</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJaiMaruk</string></dict>

        <key>Rush Clovis</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1080.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Baron Rush Clovis was a Human male who served as the representative of Scipio and a delegate for the InterGalactic Banking Clan in the Galactic Senate during the latter days of the Old Republic. Clovis entered the Senate in 25 BBY and quickly formed a relationship with fellow first-year senator, Padmé Amidala. Amidala, the representative of Naboo and the Chommell sector, served with Clovis on several committees, and the two eventually became romantically involved. Amidala soon insisted that they keep their relationship strictly professional, however—a request that was not well received by Clovis.
            Clovis continued in his post as senator for a further three years, until the outbreak of the galaxy-wide Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems in 22 BBY. As a senatorial delegate for the Confederate-allied InterGalactic Banking Clan, Clovis began clandestine dealings with Separatist interests on behalf of the clan while maintaining his appearance as a Republic Loyalist. In the early days of the war, the Banking Clan invested heavily in the creation of a new droid factory for the Separatist Droid Army to be built on the Outer Rim world of Geonosis. The factory was a joint venture with the Trade Federation, necessitating that Clovis work alongside fellow covert Confederate operative, Senator Lott Dod, and Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser. Unbeknownst to Clovis, the Jedi High Council suspected him of treason, and so asked his former flame, Padmé Amidala, to gather information on his dealings. Under the belief that Amidala was interested in resurrecting their relationship, Clovis allowed the Naboo Senator to accompany him to a meeting with Dod and Poggle on Cato Neimoidia, during which she discovered his allegiance to the Confederacy and his investments in the new Geonosian droid foundry.
            Before Amidala could relate this information back to the Jedi Order, she was poisoned by Dod, who hoped to use her as leverage over Clovis in their financial dealings. Amidala's poisoning was discovered by her secret husband, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who was posing undercover as her security guard. Understanding that his former love's life was in danger, Clovis assisted Skywalker in his attempt to get her off of Cato Neimoidia, during which he confronted Dod and forced his co-conspirator to provide them with an antidote to Amidala's poison. Despite his aid in removing Amidala from Lott Dod's palace, Skywalker was still bitter with Clovis due to his advances on Amidala, and so left the Senator on Cato Neimoidia to face the wrath of Dod and Poggle the Lesser.
            Clovis later rose to power once more when he was able to be voted into the leadership of the Banking Clan, however once more Rush became entangled with the Separatists and Dooku threatened to take everything he had again. This led to Rush running for his life once Dooku abandoned him and the Republic troops arrived to arrest him. Later Clovis was dangling from the side of a falling building being held by his enemy Anakin Skywalker with Padmé in the other hand. Although Anakin could hold both, Rush let go of Anakin's arm to save his love Padmé.
            Rush Clovis was a charismatic and wealthy[6] Human male noble hailing from the Core World of Scipio.[1] In 25 BBY,[7] Clovis became the senatorial representative of his planet in the congress of the Galactic Republic. In addition to his duties as Senator of Scipio, Clovis also held the title of baron, and served as a delegate for the InterGalactic Banking Clan—a financial corporation that had gained representation in the Galactic Senate[4] as a functional constituency.[8]
            Early in his career on the Republic capital planet Coruscant, Clovis became acquainted with fellow first-year senator, Padmé Amidala,[4] from the Mid Rim world of Naboo.[9] As the representative of the Chommell sector,[10] Amidala served on several senatorial committees with Clovis, and the two soon became close friends. Their relationship eventually became romantically charged, and Amidala was driven to request a return to professional decorum between the two, as she was primarily focused on her duties as a senator at the time. Clovis reacted poorly to Amidala's choice, and the two stopped speaking to one another all together.[4]
            Clovis continued to serve as a senator for a further three years,[4] during which time the Republic became embroiled in the Separatist Crisis and the resultant Clone Wars. During the Separatist Crisis, a number of sectors and corporations declared their intentions to leave the Republic and form a Confederacy of Independent Systems; InterGalactic Banking Clan Chairman San Hill was among the corporate executives who contributed to the creation of the Confederacy, and became a founding member of the Separatist Council. The Clone Wars erupted that year, revealing San Hill's new allegiance and placing the Banking Clan as an enemy of the Republic.[11]
            Despite the revelation of the Banking Clan's involvement in the Confederacy, the organization was not exiled from the Republic government—in fact, the InterGalactic Banking Clan was still able to provide financial services to both the Republic and the Confederacy,[12] as the extent of the institution's complicity in the war had not been revealed. The Banking Clan avoided any public connection to the Separatists, allowing Clovis to retain his position in the Senate. The Scipio Senator continued to represent the interests of the IBC in the early days of the war, but was in reality pursuing a Confederate agenda and became involved in activities that would be considered treasonous if discovered by Republic authorities. On behalf of the Banking Clan, Clovis entered into a business venture with Trade Federation Senator Lott Dod[4] in 21 BBY.[13] Like Clovis, Dod represented a Confederate financier, but was able to retain his position by claiming that Federation goods were being co-opted without the approval of the conglomerate's governing board.[12] The two jointly invested in a new Confederate droid foundry to be built on Geonosis that, when completed, would be the largest battle droid factory ever built. The Senators both expected large returns on their investment, but Dod eventually became heavily indebted to the Banking Clan, and was forced to sign over much of his holdings over the Neimoidian purse world of Cato Neimoidia to Clovis's organization.[4] The Scipio senator then used the Neimoidian's payments as collateral on loans used to build new armies and warships for the Confederacy.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rush_Clovis/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRushClovis</string></dict>
        <key>Dopak</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1081.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Dopak was a veteran of the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War who ended up as a mercenary on Dantooine under the leadership of former elite Sith commando Azkul.
            Like many veterans of the recent war, Dopak found himself unemployed as the fighting ended. He turned to soldiering for pay, and initially found work for the Republic in the Outer Rim. But the Republic, short on credits post-war, scaled back on expenses and Dopak and his compatriots were some of the casualties. Dopak subsequently joined the unnamed group of mercenaries on Dantooine.
            By the time Meetra Surik meets him, Dopak is Sith veteran Azkul's de-facto second-in-command. In conversation he displays a hardened worldview and an annoyance with the settlers in general, but stops short of being hostile toward them. He said of the settlers: "So the galaxy has dealt them a bad hand. They should ante up and get back in the game." Dopak had a grudging respect for Administrator Terena Adare, but said she needed to learn the mercenaries would not leave Dantooine just because Adare did not want them around.
            However, Dopak was not as hard-hearted as some of his comments suggested him to be. He did not agree with Azkul on his methods and actions against the settlers of Dantooine. Eventually, Dopak secretly entered an alliance with Khoonda militia leader Zherron.
            When Meetra Surik arrived on Dantooine, she earned Zherron's trust and delivered a coded message to Dopak. The message gave Dopak confirmation of Azkul's plans to attack Khoonda. Accompanying this were two words, spoken by Zherron to Meetra Surik, and then by Surik to Dopak: "Go ahead."
            During the Battle of Khoonda, Azkul attempted to kill its leader, Administrator Terena Adare. Dopak stood with Administrator Terena Adare once the mercenaries under Azkul got inside Khoonda's main building. He defected to the side of the militia, taking a small number of other mercenaries with him.
            After the battle, Dopak expressed a desire to continue mercenary work, saying, "I plan to leave with as many of my men as will come with me, and look for some work that is more honorable than the wholesale slaughter of civilians." It is unknown if he fought in the Battle of Telos IV.
            The player has the option to talk to Dopak after the battle, as he remains inside the Khoonda building. If the player commends Dopak for his change in sides, and claims that it was he that made victory possible, then the player will gain light side points.
            Dopak's survival once he defects to the side of the Khoonda Militia is not guaranteed; he can die in the fighting if the enemy characters are able to focus enough of their efforts on him. The same goes for the mercenary NPCs who side with Dopak against those still following Azkul.
            Alternatively, if the player does not give Dopak his message from Zherron before the attack on Khoonda, then Dopak is forced to fight alongside the mercenaries in the battle, where he dies if the player sides with the militia, or survives if the player sides with the mercenaries. In the latter instance, wherein Khoonda is conquered by Azkul's forces, Dopak will appear in the Khoonda building, but will not enter dialogue with Meetra Surik.
            It is never explicitly stated what side Dopak was on in either of the two wars he was in. Given that he does not have the distinctive views of Mandalorians, he was more likely with the Republic in his first war. But being as principled as he is, however rough-edged, Dopak may well have served with the Republic a second time against Darth Revan, and later Darth Malak. Given that most of the mercenaries on Dantooine are Sith veterans, Dopak may have made a point of not mentioning precisely what military service he was in to avoid giving them a reason to watch and suspect him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dopak</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDopak</string></dict>

        <key>Corlac</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1083.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Corlac, also known as TK-605, was a human male who served as a stormtrooper of the Galactic Empire in the Battle of Jakku. After gunning down their corporal, Corlac and the stormtrooper Terex buried their armor and spent a year building an "Ugly" starship to escape Jakku. While Terex was still determined to rebuild the Empire, Corlac wanted to form a criminal empire with the help of the female criminals Wenda and Bett. After gaining access to the Rothana Imperial Shipyards, Corlac and the ladies conspired to assassinate Terex. However, Terex discovered their plot and blasted them to death with the Carrion Spike's laser cannons.
            During the Galactic Civil War, Corlac signed up to serve the Galactic Empire as a stormtrooper. He was given the designation "TK-605". Corlac, along with fellow trooper TK-603 and their corporal fought the New Republic forces at Jakku. As the battle ended in favor of the New Republic, Corlac realized that the Empire had lost. When the corporal ordered them to fight to the last man under the threat of death, Corlac shot him dead. When TK-603 expressed shock, Corlac responded that he did not feel like fighting to the last man and asked TK-603 if he agreed.[2]
            When TK-603 expressed confusion and asked what were their orders, TK-605 pointed to a stricken Star Destroyer and said that the Empire was dead and there was nobody to order them around anymore. Taking off his helmet, TK-605 said that he did not work for them anymore. When TK-603 asked if he was taking off his armor, Corlac responded that the New Republic would be hunting down Imperials and they had a better chance of surviving without their armor. TK-603 realized that Corlac was right. As the two buried their armor, Corlac asked TK-603 what was his name. TK-603 reluctantly introduced himself as Terex.[2]
            The two men then hid until nightfall before heading to a settlement to find work. When Terex expressed unease about abandoning his armor, Corlac agreed that it was little more than "trash." Corlac and Terec spent about a year building an "Ugly" out of salvaged parts including the head of an AT-AT walker and TIE Interceptor wings. The two men came to regard each other as squad mates. While Terex was still determined to rejoin the Imperial remnants and help put down the Rebellion, Corlac was not interested and wanted to travel to the Outer Rim planet of Kaddak where had some contacts. Terex agreed to come provided he could bring his armor.[2]
            On Kaddak, Corlac re-established contacts with the female crime bosses Wenda and Bett, who ran a large ship repair and salvage operation. While Corlac had abandoned the Empire, Terex was still determined to rebuild the Empire. knowing that Terex had once worked at the Rothana Imperial Shipyards, Corlac manipulated Terex into helping him and his criminal associates Wenda and Bett gain access to the shipyards under the pretext of bringing back the Empire.[3] In truth, Corlac and his associates planned to use the shipyard to obtain ships for their pirate fleet.[1]
            After some attempts, Terex managed to gain Corlac, Wenda, and Bett access to the shipyard's repair bay. While the shipyard had been abandoned, it was still being maintained on auto-security mode by droids and other automated systems.[3] By 7 ABY, Corlac and his associates had taken control of the former Rothana Imperial shipyards. While Terex was repairing Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin's former starship Carrion Spike, Corlac informed Wenda and Bett that their plan to rebuild the Empire was a ruse to get Terex's help. Since the Carrion Spike had cloaking capabilities, Corlac planned to use it for piracy operations. Once Terex had fixed the ship, Corlac planned to kill Terex, regarding him as little more than a tool.[1]
            Unknown to Corlac and his criminal associates, Terex was eavesdropping on them over the intercom. He activated the Carrion Spike's weapons systems and obliterated the shipyard's control station, killing Corlac, Wenda, and Bett. Realizing that the Empire was finally gone, Terex took control of Corlac, Wenda, and Bett's gang. Terex became the leader of the Ranc gang until his pirates intercepted a shipment bound for an Imperial remnant known as the First Order. Terex subsequently left the Ranc gang and joined the First Order's Security Bureau as a spy.[1]
            Corlac was a human man with blonde hair and dark eyes. While Corlac served the Empire as a stormtrooper and claimed that Terex was his partner, he was only concerned with looking out for himself.[1] Following the Battle of Jakku, Corlac was pragmatic enough to realize that the Empire was a lost cause and cast aside his stormtrooper armor. Corlac also convinced his friend Terex to do the same. Corlac and Terex used their mechanical and scavenging skills to cobble together an "Ugly" out of discarded ship and vehicle parts.[2] Corlac was also a manipulator who played on Terex's desire to build the Empire in order to achieve his own goal of building a criminal empire. Corlac was even willing to kill his former comrade in arms to achieve these goals. However, Corlac in his pride underestimated Terex's vindictiveness.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Corlac</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascCorlac</string></dict>

He was met by Meetra Surik while protesting in Iziz's Merchant Quarter where he later instigated a riot. Ponlar tried to persuade Surik to help him and his crowd in an attack on some loyalist soldiers when a guard threatened to have him arrested.
            However, Surik refused because she believed that Talia was the rightful ruler of Onderon. Ponlar's speeches eventually began to call for a riot, but Surik eventually persuaded him to stop his propaganda.

Less than seventeen days after the battle, the captain was told to rendezvous with a messenger at Rendezvous Point: Victim in the Outer Rim Territories. Once the red-clad envoy finally boarded the Torment, Duvat discovered that his visitor carried a top secret message that allegedly came from Emperor Sheev Palpatine himself.[1] Although the Emperor had actually died during the Battle of Endor,[2] the captain dismissed it as enemy propaganda.

        <key>Biggs Darklighter</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1088.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Biggs Darklighter was a Human male starfighter pilot who served the Alliance to Restore the Republic and a childhood friend of Luke Skywalker during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Darklighter flew a T-65 X-wing starfighter with Red Squadron during the Battle of Yavin as Red Three, where he perished.
            Darklighter was born on Tatooine to the local agricultural magnate Huff Darklighter and his wife. He was raised a privileged child. The elder Darklighter owned dozens of moisture farms and bought water from other farmers at cut-rate prices. The water he did not use to irrigate his own crops he sold at high prices. As a teenager, Darklighter spent much of his time in the town of Anchorhead, where he met young Luke Skywalker. A strong friendship quickly developed between the two. Together, along with their friends Janek "Tank" Sunber, jealous Laze "Fixer" Loneozner, Camie Loneozner, and tagalongs "Deak" and Windy Starkiller, they would often socialize at Tosche Station, a power distribution center just outside Anchorhead.[1]
            The strong bond between Darklighter and Skywalker was fueled by an intense undercurrent of competition that kept their lives charged. Together, they raced landspeeders through the streets of Anchorhead and T-16 skyhoppers through Beggar's Canyon in the Jundland Wastes "tagging" womp rats. They constantly pushed one another to the limit, becoming expert pilots. Skywalker was a better shot in his T-16, but Darklighter was the better pilot in his newer model. During one run through the canyon, Darklighter "threaded" his way through a small opening in a sixty-meter spindle of rock known as the Stone Needle, giving him near-legendary status among the Anchorhead residents. Skywalker, of course, was soon forced to match the feat.[1]
            Darklighter and Skywalker also engaged in another semidangerous sport, "invented" by Fixer. Sandsurfing involved a "surfer" wearing repulsor disks on their feet while being dragged behind a sand skiff. Fixer, jealous of the superior piloting skills of his two friends, invented an obstacle course through the Dune Sea to prove himself better than they. During one run over the Great Pit of Carkoon, Fixer was knocked unconscious and fell towards the maw of the Sarlacc. Fortunately, Darklighter and Skywalker were able to save their friend. Not wishing the stunt to be duplicated, the two declared Fixer "king of the sandsurfers."[1]
            While young, Darklighter developed a romantic caring for Kandji, a local girl. She was captured by Tusken Raiders; by the time the rescue party arrived, she was dead, and all they could do was take revenge. He carried a hologram of her for the rest of his life.[5]
            As Darklighter and Skywalker grew older, the two friends planned to attend the Imperial Academy together. They also planned on buying a starship after graduation and go into business together, though they did not have any specific plans as to what they would do. Darklighter's father arranged for his son's commission into the Prefsbelt IV Naval Academy,[5] where Tank was also accepted. However, Skywalker's uncle, Owen Lars, kept his nephew behind on Tatooine for "another season." A short time before Darklighter departed, the Anchorhead gang had a celebration and race in Beggar's Canyon. The adventure ended in battle when a clan of Tusken Raiders attacked. When Darklighter was wounded by a Raider's gaderffii stick, Skywalker was forced to pilot him to safety through the treacherous Diablo Cut.[1]
            Darklighter was a skilled mechanic. He told Skywalker that a true pilot should know every last detail about his ship and how it works. So, just prior to leaving for the Academy, he decided to build a T-16 from scratch with some small assistance from Skywalker. The finished product, as Darklighter admitted, was a bit rough around the edges, but he was still proud of his work and insisted he could hold his own in his new craft against any pilot. Skywalker simply laughed in his face at the scrap heap. This angered Darklighter to an extent to which Skywalker had never seen him before, and the older man challenged his friend to a race through the canyon. What Skywalker thought would be a simple test run turned out to be a heated race, with Darklighter blasting out of the hangar without a word. His new T-16 began to shake and sway almost immediately. A lesser pilot would have been forced to slow down to maintain control. Darklighter only increased his speed. The race only lasted for about five minutes before Skywalker finally caught up with him. Just as he was about to commend Darklighter on his performance, pieces began to drop off of the makeshift T-16, including the engine. The craft crashed to the ground, rolling end-over-end several times before coming to a stop. Skywalker raced to the downed craft to check on his friend, but Darklighter was not in the pilot's seat. Fearing his friend had been fatally ejected from the craft, Skywalker was soon tackled from behind by a laughing Darklighter. Skywalker never knew exactly how Darklighter had managed to survive the crash.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Biggs_Darklighter/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBiggsDarklighter</string></dict>
        <key>Darmas Pollaran</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1089.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darmas Pollaran was the alias used by a Human male Imperial Agent who went undercover in the Coruscant Underworld as a womanizing, gambling pazaak player and Information broker during the Cold War. In his new identity, Pollaran, under the orders from the Voidwolf, coaxed Senator Bevera Dodonna to aid them in their bid to create a Pro-Sith Empire pirate fleet, in exchange for her own planet to rule. He was also suspected to help in the establishment of the Migrant Merchants' Guild.
            Known as a inveterate gambler and information broker, Darmas Pollaran operated on out of Coruscant's old Galactic Market cantina. He charged a high premium for his data and contacts, supplementing that sizable income with his impressive winning streak gambling at the card game known as sabacc.
            In 3643 BBY he was visited by the smuggler later known as Voidhound and Corso Riggs who traveled to Coruscant in search of Skavak and the former's stolen starship. Pollaran assisted the two in tracking down the ship and retaking it from Skavak.
            In 3642 BBY, Pollaran contacted the Voidhound after the smuggler had become famous for finding Nok Drayen's lost treasure and invited them to Port Nowhere. When the Voidhound arrived, Pollaran was being held captive along with Senator Bevera Dodonna by Rogun the Butcher's lackeys. The Voidhound managed to fight through Rogun's underlings and free the captive pair, after which Pollaran explained that he had gone legitimate, working for Dodonna. He also claimed that Rogun was working for the Voidwolf, the Imperial Grand Admiral who sought to dominate the galactic underworld. In return for rescuing them, Dodonna appointed the Voidhound a Republic privateer to take on the jobs the respectable military couldn't.
            Pollaran acted as the Voidhound's liaison on Balmorra. He told the smuggler that they were to steal Project Nebula, a former Republic operation of weapons development, abandoned when the Empire took the planet, the latter then taking over the project and intending to use the prototype weaponry against the Republic itself.
            After the Voidhound completed a mission on Hoth for Dodonna, Pollaran summoned his associate back to Port Nowhere to discuss a mutually beneficial business opportunity. He introduced the Voidhound to Vaz Traniff, an enemy of Rogun. The plan was to rescue Traniff's vault cracker, Combo, from Rogun, so they could raid an Imperial treasury ship, the King's Ransom. It would be profitable, a service to the Republic and the Voidhound could do some damage to Rogun's organization.
            After the success of the heist, narrowly escaping the destruction of the treasury ship by the Voidwolf, and saving Dodonna from Rogun's assassins, the Voidhound went to Port Nowhere to meet with Pollaran. Senator Dodonna decided to further enlist the Voidhound's services in taking down Rogun when Darmas got the Senator on holocall, forcing her to pull out of a Senate vote. Pollaran then informed her that the cybernetic beasts that Rogun's assassins used in their attack on her were native to the planet Voss. As the export of Voss fauna had not been legalized, it was obvious that they were smuggled. Dodonna claimed that Voss was only a recent discovery and it would take her time to grant the Voidhound a landing permit. Pollaran added that the only one who knew all of Rogun secrets was his mentor, Ivory, and he disappeared years ago. But Dodonna revealed that Ivory was being kept in a secret Republic prison on Belsavis. The Voidhound proceeded to track down Ivory during a mass-prison breakout orchestrated by the Empire, managing to learn the locations of all of Rogun's safehouses across the galaxy, which Pollaran proceeded to research. After the Voidhound shut down Rogun's smuggling ring on Voss, Pollaran informed the smuggler that Rogun was rallying his remaining lieutenants to his safehouse on Tatooine.
            However, Pollaran soon revealed himself as an agent of the Voidwolf, who had managed to convince Dodonna to turn traitor and support the Empire in exchange for a planet of her own. The Voidwolf showed the Voidhound and Rogun a hologram of the exchange between the two before the smuggler actually knocked off the Butcher. With Rogun's help, the Voidhound survived the betrayal and tracked down Pollaran on Corellia. Pollaran had infiltrated the Corellian Resistance and had duped rebel leader Nevis Kitt into attempting to clear out supply tunnel 26, making him think that it would give the resistance an opening, when in fact it'd be for the Empire.
            When confronted by the Voidhound while hosting a resistance rally, Pollaran quickly attempted to turn the crowd against the former, claiming that the smuggler was an agent of the Voidwolf. However, the Voidhound managed to convince the resistance of Pollaran's true allegiance. With his cover blown, Pollaran called for reinforcements, which showed up in the form of assassin droids, which gave cover for his escape. Pollaran made his way to Councilor Caicos' factory, now a makeshift Imperial medical center, in Labor Valley, to get plastic surgery to change his identity and disappear. However, the Voidhound tracked him down and arrested him.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darmas_Pollaran</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarmasPollaran</string></dict>
        <key>Wrenga Jixton</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1090.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Wrenga Jixton, better known as Jix, was an Imperial agent working directly for Darth Vader.
            Wrenga Jixton was born on Corellia and eventually found himself enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Carida. Jix's training eventually helped find himself a place as a combat trainer for new recruits. In his current occupation, Jix eventually was placed on a mission with Darth Vader in 8 BBY. The mission was the sterilization of Falleen, and involved the deaths of 200,000 Falleen. Jix did not perform his duty admirably and was court-martialled and sent to the spice mines of Kessel. Jix eventually orchestrated a miraculous escape, after which he fled to the remote world of Aridus and befriended the local Chubbits. Around 0 ABY, Darth Vader came to Aridus in an effort to capture Luke Skywalker. Vader was being helped by an impersonator of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The actor was ordered to lead Skywalker into a trap within the Iron Tower on Aridus. Unfortunately for Vader, the actor betrayed him and destroyed the tower, killing himself and injuring Vader severely.
            Jix saw the whole thing play itself out and went to survey the damage from the tower. There he found Vader unconscious and vulnerable. On Aridus, Jix had come to appreciate the local Chubbits and did not want to see them harmed by an Imperial occupation. He saved Vader's life and brought him back to Coruscant. When Vader awoke he struck a deal with the Dark Lord, forcing him to promise to leave Aridus and the local Chubbits alone in exchange for Jix's eternal servitude. Vader agreed, and Jix reentered Imperial service as Vader's personal servant.
            Jix quickly proved himself a capable servant to Vader by exposing a traitor, whom Vader executed. Jix was later assigned to ensure the survival of Luke Skywalker on Tatooine. Vader was well aware that Prince Xizor of Black Sun was attempting to kill Skywalker. Jix traveled to Tatooine with orders to infiltrate Jabba Desilijic Tiure's swoop gang. Shortly after landing in Mos Eisley, Jix confronted the swoop gang, led by Big Gizz and Spiker.
            Despite Jix's tough talk, he was unable to fend off the entire gang once they began beating him with chains and bludgeons until Gizz ordered them to stop. Impressed with his guts, Gizz suggested that Jix race to prove whether he could join the gang. Jix accepted the challenge, and won by shooting his competitor. Again, Big Gizz was impressed and accepted Jix into the gang.
            As a swoop racer, Jix went on to participate in racing championship. On Corellia, in the preparation for Agrilat Swamp Circuit race Jix was approached by an operative sent by Lonay. The Black Sun vigo had a personal vendetta against a racing star Kimmi Chyler and attempted to use both Jix and his operative to humiliate her. Jix agreed, that Chyler's downfall would help his team and accepted the help. The operative was hired as a mechanic and was to inspect Chyler's swoop for illegal modifications.[2] Chyler, however, won the race anyway, and Jix was furious, confronting her and her team after the race.[3]
            Meanwhile, Jabba had received word from Xizor about killing Luke. Jix suggested this would greatly anger Darth Vader, which drew many laughs from the gang. Jabba then sent the gang to kill Luke, who was staying in Ben Kenobi's hut in the Dune Sea. Earlier in Mos Eisley, Jix had mentioned in the cantina his affiliation with the Galactic Empire and was overheard by Dash Rendar. Rendar sped to Luke's aid, but arrived after the gang did.
            Luke was nearly overwhelmed by the swoop gang, but held his own aboard a hijacked swoop and led them through Beggar's Canyon. When Spiker got a clear shot at Luke, Jix rammed his swoop into Spiker's to keep Luke alive. Although Jix broke both of his legs in the crash, Spiker was nearly dead and Luke alive and well. However, there was still Big Gizz to worry about. Gizz, furious at losing more than half his gang to Luke and Dash, leveled his rifle at Luke but was struck in the skull with a rock by Jix. Jix fulfilled his mission, allowing Luke to live so that Vader himself could deal with him.
            Later, Jix was still with the swoop gang as Boba Fett delivered Han Solo, still frozen in carbonite, to Jabba the Hutt. Fett's ship, Slave I, landed on the outskirts of Jabba's land, and a swoop rode out of the cargo hold, towing a hovering platform. Several bounty hunters pursued the swoop rider, presumably Fett. Also in pursuit was the swoop gang. Jix and Spiker were shot down. Spiker was severely wounded, ending up near-dead. Just then Jix hid a communications code book on Spiker's body in order to make him look like a traitor to Jabba the Hutt. The bounty hunters caught up with the swoop rider, only to find it was not Boba Fett at all, but a decoy. The real Boba Fett had successfully handed in his bounty on Solo.
            Jix was created for the Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire multimedia project, based on a background character in Jabba's Palace in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. His role in the story was originally filled by a character named "Talan", created by John Wagner and described as the leader of a "savage", "nomadic space tribe."[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wrenga_Jixton</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascWrengaJixton</string></dict>

            Jobin was a corporal in the Alliance Military, and commanded the 4th Squad on Hoth during the battle there. When Imperial Troops invaded with a surface attack, his platoon set out to assist Ion Control when one of his men noticed Imperial troops approaching from the South Ridge. His squad was attacked by an AT-ST, but Jobin was able to destroy it with a satchel charge and marched into the Ion Control center, where he killed a stormtrooper with an icicle. It was Jobin who activated Echo Base's v-150 anti-orbital ion cannon, which disabled an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer in orbit. He was killed in 3 ABY during the Battle of Hoth at the hands of Darth Vader while attempting to escape Echo Base. When his squad tried to escape on a transport, Lord Vader and his stormtroopers came upon them. While he was running towards the transport, Jobin was shot and gave another Rebel trooper a holo-recording for his mother. Though he shot at Darth Vader his efforts were to no avail. Vader levitated him off the ground and began to choke him. He attempted to interrogate the dying man, but Jobin refused to surrender any information, even spitting on him as an act of defiance. Vader then broke his neck with the Force, killing him.

        <key>Daren</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1092.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Daren was a human male[2] who during the Clone Wars was rescued from two B2 super battle droids by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.[1] One year into the reign of the Galactic Empire,[3] Daren was on the planet Mon Cala along with Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr and five other acolytes of Barr.[1] After informing the group that Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One who was believed by some to bring balance to the Force.[2]
            During the Clone Wars, Daren's settlement was attacked by the Separatist Droid Army. Daren soon found himself at gunpoint as a B2 super battle droid prepared to gun him down. However before he could meet his untimely end, the droids were both cut in half by a Jedi Knight who identified himself as Anakin Skywalker. Skywalker prompted Daren to find somewhere to hide and leapt towards the ensuing battle.[1]
            At the end of the Clone Wars, the clone troopers turned on the Jedi and almost completely wiped them out. Broadcasts from the new Galactic Empire stated that there were none left. Daren didn't like this seeing as one had saved his life and was lucky enough to run into a surviving Jedi Padawan named Ferren Barr. Barr claimed to be a Jedi Master and offered Daren a purpose in going against the Empire. Daren agreed and joined Barr and his other acolytes.[1]
            Barr took Daren and the other five acolytes to Mon Cala, where Barr[1] began influencing King Lee-Char's negotiations with the Empire. This drew more attention from the Empire with Moff Wilhuff Tarkin parking the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Sovereign above Mon Cala. Emperor Palpatine himself soon sent his enforcer, Darth Vader, and three Inquisitors to investigate. Barr, unaware of Vader's arrival, decided to assassinate Tarkin's ambassador, Telvar, prompting Tarking to send his forces down to Mon Cala. Lee-Char warned Barr of the incoming forces and then described Vader to him, to which Barr identified as really being Anakin Skywalker.[3]
            Barr came over to Daren and told them of Skywalker's arrival. Barr then showed them an image of Skywalker attacking the Jedi Temple and explained that he now called himself Darth Vader and continued to hunt surviving Jedi along with Inquisitors, who Barr called Jedi traitors. Daren asked Barr that if Emperor Palpatine's enforcers were Jedi, why didn't he tell anyone about this fact. In response, Barr said that maybe if he had told someone just after Palpatine's ascension to power it would have made a difference, but now no one would care and even if anyone paid attention to him, Palpatine would just simply lie.[2]
            Tarkin's forces were winning at Dac City only to be wiped out by large tidal waves generated by large creatures.[2] Vader and his Inquisitors survived and managed to get the whereabouts of Barr and his acolytes. Lee-Char informed Barr of Vader's imminent approach[4] and Barr ordered Daren and the others to get ready to evacuate. They did so but as they emigrated Barr's refuge, they were met by Vader and the Inquisitor's on an Imperial submarine. The acolytes scattered, except for Nipaltoo who attacked Vader's submarine head on. Vader crushed Nipaltoo's helmet and vectored towards the others.[1]
            Barr and the other began towards Bel City where Vader followed. Another acolyte, Orvek, turned around to slow Vader down, sacrificing himself. As they got to Bel City, Rebb and Stell stayed behind to slow them even more. Barr, Daren and Verla made for a ship. They got to a hanger only to find it empty. Barr stated that they needed to act quick and find another way out, but it was too late. Daren was cut down by the Sixth Brother's lightsaber. Sixth Brother and the other two Inquisitors then surrounded Barr and Verla.[1]

        <key>Darth Achelon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1093.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Achelon was a Human male Sith Lord of the Sith Empire, that served Darth Thanaton under his tenure as Dark Council member. His flagship, the Carnage, engaged a Republic fleet in battle and only the Doombringer could provide assistance with the Silencer superweapon. But the Doombringer was commanded by Lord Kallig, Thanaton's nemesis, who was looking forward to testing the Silencer to win an alliance with anti-Thanaton Moffs and had to choose whether to save Achelon or not.
            Darth Achelon is a character in the 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic MMORPG video game.
            Achelon's fate can be decided three ways. Kallig can choose to let the Republic destroy his flagship, fire the Silencer at him or tell him to withdraw. If Kallig tells Achelon to withdraw to a safe distance before firing the Silencer, the latter would agree not to attack Kallig on sight. Achelon is later seen on Corellia, commanded by Thanaton to kill the player. However, Achelon refused to turn on Kallig after being spared by his enemy. After Kallig manages to defeat Thanaton and assume his place on the Dark Council, Achelon would be among those who swear loyalty to the newly anointed Dark Lord. You may then instruct him on what to do with your resources. If Achelon is dead, Lord Kirnon will take his place.[1]
            If Achelon was killed, Thanaton will order Darth Kallous to kill Lord Kallig.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Achelon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthAchelon</string></dict>

        <key>Darth Vader  </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1095.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>A clone of Darth Vader was created on Dantooine, and was killed by the real Darth Vader.
            At some point before 0 ABY, Darth Vader visited ancient Jedi ruins on Dantooine which housed an active, yet unmanned, cloning facility. He was ambushed by security turrets and his squad was all killed. Vader was injured during this visit and some of his blood was left in the facility.
            Believing that they were properly executing their programming, the experimental cloning droids running the facility created a clone of Vader using this sample. The droids then applied a mysterious technique (used with all of the facility's clones) in which they imprinted the clone with Vader's personality (from mental imprints left by the original host).
            However, as with the other clones from the facility, this process was faulty and left the clone with only partial mental functioning and personality synchronization. This notion seems to explain why the clone was unable to utilize the full Force potential of its presumably uninjured, four-limbed body in its later fight against the real Darth Vader, who had not held such a physical state since before his fateful duel with Count Dooku in 22 BBY.
            Despite apparently not requiring armor similar to Vader's, the clone was dressed in a costume accurately reflecting the detail, but without the functionality of Darth Vader's armor. Tash Arranda deduced that it had been constructed from scrap lying around the abandoned Rebel base on Dantooine. The clone Vader also had a lightsaber, however, like the armor it was merely an imitation, producing a fake blade that simply passed through objects without inflicting any damage.
            Darth Vader returned to the facility in 0 ABY, soon after Tash Arranda, Zak Arranda, and Mammon Hoole visited there. Vader slew his clone in battle and briefly contemplated its nature before departing the facility.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Vader_(clone)</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthVader</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Bandon</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1096.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Bandon was a Human male Jedi Padawan who defected to the Sith Empire during the Jedi Civil War, a conflict initiated by the Sith Lords Darth Revan and Darth Malak. Sometime after Malak betrayed his Master, Revan, during an ambush by the Jedi and Republic forces attempting to capture them, Bandon became the new Dark Lord's first Shadow Hand, elevating him to second-in-command of the Sith Empire. When the Sith attacked the Republic warship Endar Spire above the planet Taris, Bandon boarded the ship along with the Sith troopers and Dark Jedi under his command and tried to capture the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan. He killed the Republic ensign Trask Ulgo, who sacrificed himself to save the former Sith Lord Revan, who had been mentally reprogrammed to be loyal to the Republic and to serve as a common soldier by the Jedi Council.
            Shortly after the destruction of Taris, the bounty hunter Calo Nord was hired by Malak to follow in pursuit of Shan, who escaped the bombardment with the help of Revan and his companions. After Nord was slain by Revan, Malak dispatched Bandon to find and capture the Jedi. Bandon located Revan in Manaan's underwater kolto harvesting base known as Hrakert Station, on the Selkath homeworld Manaan. The Sith apprentice confronted Revan and his allies after they found a fourth Star Map that would give them the location of the Star Forge—the ancient Rakatan space station under Malak's control. Bandon underestimated the former Dark Lord and his companions, assuming that they would be no match for him. This proved to be his downfall, as Revan and his team vanquished Malak's Shadow Hand, along with the two Dark Jedi accompanying him. After his death, Bandon's head was severed from his body and preserved by the Sith. Three hundred years later, it had eventually been put on display in the House Alde Royal Museum on Alderaan.
            The Human male who would be known as Darth Bandon was a Jedi Padawan, though he never fully accepted the teachings of the Jedi Code. Even though the Force flowed through him, Bandon's powerful emotions, such as anger and hatred, raged within and fueled his strength.[3] His Jedi Master tried to curb these strong emotions, but the brash Padawan chafed under his Master's guidance.[1]
            In the year 3959 BBY, the former Jedi Knights Revan and Malak, the heroes of the Mandalorian Wars, found the ancient space station known as the Star Forge—a relic of the Rakatan Infinite Empire that had ruled the galaxy nearly 20,000 years before—and named themselves the new Dark Lords of the Sith.[1] Revan and Malak declared war on the Jedi Council[4] and the Galactic Republic, initiating the Jedi Civil War. Bandon rejected his old Master and the Jedi Order, fleeing to the revitalized academy on the ancient Sith homeworld of Korriban.[3]
            As a student in the new Korriban academy, Bandon fully embraced the teachings of the dark side and the Sith Code. This—along with Bandon's strength with the Force, his natural cruelty, and his utter ruthlessness in his quest for power—soon set Bandon apart from his fellow students and brought the attention of Darth Malak, Revan's Sith apprentice.[3] Bandon eventually won Malak's admiration.[1][5] Two years into the Jedi Civil War,[1] the Jedi and Republic forces set a trap for Revan and Malak in an attempt to capture both Sith Lords.[6][7] During the battle, Malak betrayed his Sith Master by ordering his flagship Leviathan to open fire on Revan's vessel. After Malak thought he successfully eliminated Revan, he seized his former Master's mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith.[2]
            In the tradition of the Sith Order, Malak sought a single learner among his followers to become his official apprentice, someone that could learn the Sith secrets and use them to effectively destroy the Jedi and the Republic.[8] Malak took the promising Bandon as his Shadow Hand, which made him second only to his Master in the Sith Empire.[1] The Dark Lord taught much of his knowledge of the Sith to Bandon. Malak was not disappointed with his choice of taking Bandon as his apprentice, because Bandon killed many Jedi during the war. In a short time, rumors began to surface that Bandon would challenge Malak for the right to rule the Sith;[3] Bandon eventually began to set his sights on his Sith Master's throne.[1]
            In the year 3956 BBY,[1] Darth Malak was searching for a Jedi Knight named Bastila Shan, fearing her strength in Battle meditation, a Force power that boosted the Republic forces' morale during battle while sapping the Sith's will to fight. When Malak learned of Shan's location aboard the Republic warship Endar Spire, he sent a Sith battle fleet to ambush the ship. Above the planet Taris, Bandon led the boarding party that stormed the Endar Spire, in an attempt to capture or kill Shan.[2] An amnesiac Revan—who had been rescued by Shan after Malak betrayed him and later mind-wiped by the Jedi Council—was placed under Shan's command as a common Republic soldier.[9][10] Bandon confronted Revan and the Republic ensign Trask Ulgo during their attempt to reach the ship's escape pods, also hoping to ensure that Shan fled the ship alive.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Bandon</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthBandon</string></dict>

        <key>Jon Vander</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1098.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Jon "Dutch" Vander was a male human pilot from Onderon who first served in the Galactic Empire's Imperial Navy before defecting to the rebellion. By 2 BBY, he served as the leader of Gold Squadron, a squadron made up of BTL Y-wing light bombers, with the rank of captain. In this role, he was instrumental in escorting the fugitive Senator Mon Mothma safely to Dantooine, where the Alliance to Restore the Republic would be formed. With the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War, Vander fought with his squadron in the battles of Scarif, where his leadership contributed to the destruction of the Shield Gate, and Yavin, by which time he had become a quadruple ace. Here, however, he would be killed while attempting a trench run on the Death Star battle station, shot down by the Sith Lord Darth Vader.
            A male human from the planet Onderon, Jon Vander was an Imperial pilot in the Imperial Navy.[1] Onderon was a destabilized, war-torn world because of the militant insurgency of Saw Gerrera's Partisans;[3] however, when Vander was ordered to bomb pro-rebel areas on his homeworld, he refused, instead defecting to the rebellion against the Empire.[1]
            By 2 BBY, Vander had joined the nascent rebellion, becoming the flight leader of the Gold Squadron rebel cell, which flew BTL-A4 Y-wing light bombers.[4] They protected rebel convoys and attacked a few soft Imperial targets.[5] At this time, Senator Mon Mothma, who was secretly involved in the rebellion, delivered a fiery speech on the HoloNet denouncing Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine for his role in the Ghorman Massacre.[4]
            As a result, Mothma was branded a traitor and forced to flee her homeworld of Chandrila.[6] Gold Squadron took on the duty of protecting the former Senator and escorting her ship Chandrila Mistress[7] to Dantooine, where they planned to rendezvous with other rebel cells. First, however, they met up with elements of Phoenix Cell for refueling of the Senator's transport. Vander and Gold Two, as well as Mothma's aide Erskin Semaj and met Phoenix Leader Hera Syndulla and her cell known as the Spectres.[4]
            Despite butting heads with Hera's underlings Ezra Bridger, Garazeb Orrelios, and the astromech droid Chopper over the sensitive nature of the mission, Vander allowed Ezra to fly a Y-wing after the pilot Gold Two was wounded during an Imperial attack. Vander and Gold Squadron used their ion cannons to disable an Arquitens-class command cruiser before bombing it. They also formed a defensive perimeter around Mon Mothma's shuttle which gave the rebel leader and her crew enough time to board Hera's ship Ghost and escape to hyperspace.[4]
            Captain Syndulla suggested an old smuggler's route through the Archeon Nebula to escape the Lothal sector undetected. However, this tactic was deduced by Grand Admiral Thrawn, and he deployed two Imperial I-class Star Destroyers, as well as an experimental TIE/D Defender starfighter piloted by the ace pilot Commander Vult Skerris, to defeat them and take the Senator into Imperial custody. Although the TIE Defender took down his entire squadron save for himself and Bridger, the two cooperated to first defeat Skerris through their mounted ion cannons.[4]
            After defeating Skerris, Vander warned Ezra that the seasoned TIE pilot would return. They later exited the Archeon Nebula only to find the Ghost being drawn into the tractor beam of one of the Imperial Star Destroyers. At Hera's command, Vander and Ezra fired their proton torpedoes into the Archeon Nebula, igniting the gas and triggering an inferno that engulfed the two Star Destroyers. The rebels then took the opportunity to safely escape to Dantooine. There, Captain Vander, Gold Two and the other rebels were present when Mon Mothma gave an impassioned speech urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion against the Empire. Shortly later, a rebel fleet emerged from hyperspace[4] and the Alliance to Restore the Republic was formed.[8]
            Eventually, Vander and his squadron would be stationed at the Alliance's secret Base One on Yavin 4, the fourth moon of Yavin, he flew Gold One, often with his astromech, R2-BHD.[6] Vander and Gold Squadron, along with Blue, Green,[6] and Red Squadrons, departed from the Rebel base to accompany Admiral Raddus in his support of the Rogue One team in their attempt to steal the technical readouts of the planet-destroying Death Star battle station. Assisting in the space battle as Raddus' fleet attacked the Shield Gate orbital station, Vander and Gold Squadron conducted several attack runs on the Shield Gate, utilizing proton bombs in an effort to weaken the shield. After sustaining casualties, they were redirected by Raddus against the flotilla of Star Destroyers.[9]
            Vander gave the order to take advantage of an opening in Imperial defenses, and he and four of his wing mates swooped into position to attack. The Gold Squadron pilots launched ion torpedoes at the Star Destroyer Persecutor, disabling it and allowing it to be rammed by a Sphyrna-class corvette, the Lightmaker. Colliding with the Star Destroyer Intimidator as well as the Shield Gate, this disabled the deflector shield and allowed the plans on the ground to be successfully transmitted from the Citadel Tower to the Profundity, and eventually, the Tantive IV.[9] Vander survived the battle, and the actions of he and his squadron would prove beneficial in helping the Alliance to victory at Scarif, despite the high number of casualties.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Vander</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascJonVander</string></dict>

        <key>Brejik</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1102.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Brejik was the leader of the Black Vulkars, a swoop gang of the Lower City on Taris that, under his direction, led a gang war against their rivals the Hidden Beks in the time of the Jedi Civil War. Formerly the lieutenant to Gadon Thek, head of the Hidden Beks, Brejik defected to the Black Vulkars when his mentor refused to retire and allow him to succeed. The war he prosecuted as head of the Black Vulkars wrecked chaos throughout the Lower City. When he captured and enslaved the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan, he provoked the intervention of two agents of the Republic, Revan and Carth Onasi, ultimately leading to his downfall.
            In the days leading up to the Mandalorian attack on Taris, Brejik kidnapped the children of Sector Constable Noana Sowrs, planning to hold them for ransom and gain a profit as Gadon had taught him. Before he could make any demands, however, riots broke out on the planet. Rather than letting the children go, Brejik chose to hold them until the opportunity to contact the constable presented itself. He enlisted to the help of fellow gang member Griff Vao to help him take care of the children and keep his secret. When the Mandalorians invaded, Brejik fought with the rest of the Beks in resisting them.
            Soon, Griff's sister Mission discovered her brother's covert activities, and shortly after the arrival of Zayne Carrick, she followed him with Zayne and his companion Marn Hierogryph. Not wanting his secret discovered, Brejik attacked Zayne with a vibrosword, but was stopped by Del Moomo before he could kill the former Padawan.
            Though Gadon was furious that Brejik had not only kidnapped the children, but kept them secret, he recognized that they were a good opportunity to convince the Taris Resistance to ally with their gang. Brejik accompanied the rest of the Beks to the Resistance headquarters where the temporary alliance was forged. Brejik was later part of the mission to destroy the Jedi Tower, where he helped rig explosives in its foundation to bring the building down in hopes of killing Mandalorian military leader Cassus Fett. The mission was a failure, however, as Fett had already vacated the building and the Mandalorians had discovered and attacked the Resistance headquarters. Always eager to use his blaster, Brejik led Del Moomo back to the compound to fight the Mandalorians and return to the Beks' fallout point, the Pit.
            At some point between the Siege of Taris in 3962 BBY and the Sith occupation in 3956 BBY, Gadon Thek was the victim of a severe swoop racing crash, a disaster that left him blinded. The handicap prompted the expectations by many in the Hidden Beks, not least of all Brejik, for his retirement. When Thek restored his vision with cybernetic implants, however, he declined to step down to make way for Brejik's succession, deeming the moment a few years too soon for the inexperienced Brejik. Outraged and impatient, Brejik refused to wait any longer and defected to the arch-rival gang: the Black Vulkars, taking many of the disgruntled, younger Beks with him.[1]
            Not long afterwards, Brejik seized power as Black Vulkars' new gang leader with the aid of his followers and initiated a devastating gang war with the Hidden Beks in an attempt to conquer the entire Lower City. Unlike the Beks, the Vulkars openly engaged in trades such as illicit drugs and slavery and fired indiscriminately at gang members and civilians alike.[1]
            In 3956 BBY during the Jedi Civil War, the Sith Empire ambushed a Galactic Republic cruiser, the Endar Spire, in the hopes of capturing the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan on board, as her unique ability of battle meditation was pivotal to the Republic war effort. As the Endar Spire was boarded by Sith forces, Republic officers, including Shan retreated to Taris on escape pods. Shan's pod, in particular, crash-landed in the Undercity. Within hours of the crash, Black Vulkars arrived to scavenge the pods where they found Shan, alive. Hoping to sell her into slavery, they captured the Jedi and delivered her to Brejik.[1]
            While Brejik did not realize that Shan was a Jedi, he did knew her as a Republic officer and therefore, a prisoner too valuable to merely sell to the Exchange or on the slave market. He devised a plot to offer her as the grand prize of that year's annual swoop race, the Tarisian Season Opener, in the hopes that this would cultivate the loyalty of many of the smaller gangs that could bolster his forces against the Hidden Beks. With such a scheme in mind, Brejik took measures to hide Shan in a secure location away from the Black Vulkar Base until the day of the swoop rice, not even trusting his own subordinates to be near her.[1]
            Meanwhile, the Hidden Beks developed a prototype swoop accelerator that was expected to be far superior to the engines of all other swoop bikes at the race. As the accelerator was designed to guarantee victory for the biker using it, the Black Vulkars to stole it for themselves. With the prototype engine secured, Brejik hoped that the prize he offered would fall back to the Vulkars anyways. He had not counted for the intervention of Revan and Captain Carth Onasi, two other Republic soldiers that had survived the destruction of the Endar Spire.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brejik</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBrejik</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Wredd</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1103.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Wredd was a male Human Sith apprentice, who served the One Sith during the Second Imperial Civil War. The man who became Darth Wredd had once been a good-natured Force-sensitive warrior from the remote, primitive planet Mala. Towards the end of the Second Imperial Civil War, the One Sith had tested a bioweapon which destroyed all life on his homeworld. However, the Sith spared the warrior's life and he was apprenticed to a Sith Lord, who stripped him of his identity and forced him to wear a helmet which enhanced his dark-side powers. Embracing the dark side, Darth Wredd developed a homicidal hatred towards the Sith and sought to bring about their downfall. Following the death of Darth Krayt, which ended his Galactic Empire, Darth Wredd and his master went underground as part of the Sith strategy of infiltrating governments and corporations across the galaxy to restore their "golden age."
            In 138 ABY, Darth Wredd found an opportunity to move against the One Sith during the Carreras Incident. After trapping an Imperial Knight named Yalta Val in the Surd Nebula, Darth Wredd killed his master and stole Master's Val's identity and armor. He then took control of the Carreras G51 communications array and used it to announce his presence to the wider galaxy. Wredd also attempted to kill Master Val before a live galactic audience but was thwarted by Ania Solo, a local junk dealer who was a descendant of the smuggler Han Solo. Despite failing to kill Master Val, Darth Wredd managed to escape the Carreras system in a getaway transport and initiated an insurgency against the One Sith. Darth Wredd began hunting down and killing Sith infiltrators across the galaxy. The rogue Sith was motivated by a desire for vengeance against those who had destroyed his homeworld and also wanted to establish a new Sith Order based on the Rule of Two.
            Following the Carreras Incident, the Imperial Knight Jao Assam experienced a Force vision of Darth Wredd attacking Empress Marasiah Fel, the daughter of Roan Fel and one of three triumvirs of the new Galactic Triumvirate. Jao and his new ally Ania Solo embarked on a quest to hunt down the rogue Sith. Darth Wredd planted a series of false clues which led Jao and Ania to the Calamari system, where another Sith named Darth Luft had established a slaving operation using Mon Calamari and Quarren refugees. Despite liberating the enslaved refugees and killing Darth Luft, Jao and Ania quickly learned from Darth Wredd himself that they had merely helped him to advance his goal of destroying the One Sith. Sensing Jao's potential, Darth Wredd attempted to tempt the Knight with an offer of becoming his apprentice in a reconstituted Sith Order.
            Later, Jao Assam returned to the galactic capital Coruscant to clear Ania's name when she was framed for the murder of the Imperial Knight Teemen Alton. Despite his role in securing Ania's exoneration, Jao was imprisoned for deserting the Imperial Knights, a crime which carried the death penalty. Exploiting Jao's predicament, Darth Wredd visited Jao in prison and offered to help him escape. Jao accepted the offer, not because he wanted to give himself over to the dark side, but instead because he wanted to foil whatever plot Darth Wredd was hatching against the Empress. However, Darth Wredd quickly deduced that Jao was still loyal to the Empress and tricked him into luring the Imperial Knights and the One Sith onto Mala, where he intended to exact his revenge against the One Sith for the wrongs they had inflicted on his homeworld. Darth Wredd's plan worked, and Mala became the site of a climactic battle between the Imperial Knights and the One Sith.
            Having succeeded with his goal of destroying the One Sith, Darth Wredd came to believe that he had delved too far into the dark side to be redeemed. Realizing that he was the only Sith left, he launched a suicidal attack on Empress Fel, nearly succeeding in killing her. However, he was thwarted by Jao Assam who attacked him with his lightsaber and succeeded in slicing off both his hands. In an attempt to draw Jao to the dark side, Darth Wredd tried to goad the Imperial Knight into killing him. However, Jao saw through his trick and refused to strike him down in anger. Ultimately, Darth Wredd was killed by Ania Solo, bringing an apparent end to the Sith presence in the galaxy.
            Darth Wredd started out as a simple and humble man on the planet of Mala. Due to his Force powers, he developed a reputation among his friends for never missing a target while hunting with an arrow. While he was baffled initially by his unusual skill, he came to realize that he was actually Force-sensitive. He wanted to join the Jedi Order. But by that time, the Jedi had been driven underground following the Massacre at Ossus and scattered across the galaxy. Not long after that, a horde of barbarians known as the Schor-Goya had launched a campaign of raiding, plundering and killing on the various towns and villages in the area. The man resolved to do what a Jedi would and came to the defense of his people. While he was unable to create a lightsaber, he was able to forge a sword, which he used to defeat the Schor-Goya when they attempted to attack his village. Eventually, he married and had a child. While he was unable to join the Jedi, he still sought to follow their ways and became widely known as the protector of his people.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Wredd</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthWredd</string></dict>
        <key>Vill</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1104.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>"Vill" was the nickname of a clone of the deceased bounty hunter Jango Fett. Originally a clone trooper of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, Vill became one of the first stormtroopers after the Galactic Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire. As a clone programmed with absolute loyalty, Vill was an obedient soldier who executed orders without moral or ethical restraint.
            A month after Emperor Palpatine's Declaration of a New Order, Vill served as commander of a regiment of stormtroopers from the 501st Legion, an elite unit of clone soldiers who served directly under the command of the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Vill and his regiment were dispatched on a mission to New Plympto with orders to eradicate the last remaining pockets of Separatist resistance.
            In 19 BBY, a month after Emperor Palpatine abolished the Galactic Republic in order to create the Galactic Empire,[5] Vill was one of millions of clone troopers who continued his service as a stormtrooper. By this time, he was a regiment commander in the elite 501st Legion, and thus he answered directly to the Emperor's second-in-command, the Sith Lord Darth Vader.[3][6]
            Around the same time, the Imperial subjugation of New Plympto proceeded at a slow pace with great difficulty. The native Nosaurians, former members of the Separatist Alliance, created their own resistance cell after the Clone Wars was concluded. Ironically, they found a new ally in a former enemy. General Dass Jennir, a Jedi survivor of Order 66, joined the Nosaurians' fight against the Empire.[3]
            As a result of the Nosaurians' ongoing rebellion, Emperor Palpatine dispatched a stormtrooper regiment of the 501st Legion, under the leadership of Commander Vill, to New Plympto with orders to bring the planet under Imperial control by annihilating the rebels. After their arrival, Vill and his soldiers steadily pushed the Nosaurians back until the rebels were forced to make a final stand at Half-Axe Pass.[3][6]
            The Battle of Half-Axes Pass was a complete massacre in which the Nosaurian army was almost utterly destroyed. Those who surrendered after the battle were summarily executed by the 501st Legion. Their families were captured and, by order of Emperor Palpatine, Commander Vill had them all processed into slave market on Orvax IV. Afterward, the clone commander reported the details of the battle to Darth Vader via holocomm.[3]
            As the 501st prepared to depart the conquered planet of New Plympto, Commander Vill returned to Vader's flagship, the Imperator-class Star Destroyer Exactor. He reported directly to Commander Appo, Vader's second-in-command in the 501st Legion, who wanted to know about an infiltration incident that occurred after the battle. Vill, unaware that the infiltrator was the Jedi Dass Jennir, said that a Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter was stolen from the 203rd Division and used to create a distraction that enabled most of the grounded civilian ships to escape from New Plympto.[7]
            Three months later, Commander Vill and the 501st Legion participated in the Imperial conquest of the planet Bandomeer, an operation that was personally overseen by Darth Vader. In the aftermath of the campaign, which was easily won against a group of lightly-armed rebellious miners, Vill provided a casualty report to the Sith Lord. Vader then took the opportunity to ask Vill if the clones were indoctrinated with a contingency order to kill him; an order that they would carry out without question if it came from Emperor Palpatine. Vill's hesitation to answer the question confirmed Vader's suspicion. He then Force pushed the clone commander off of a cliff to ensure that his inquiry did not reach the Emperor.[2]
            Like virtually all clones who were grown to serve the Galactic Republic,[8] Vill was programmed with absolute loyalty to the command hierarchy.[1] As such, his full allegiance belonged to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic. When Palpatine declared himself emperor of the first Galactic Empire,[5] Vill dedicated his existence to enforcing Palpatine's New Order over the galaxy.[3]
            As typical of a clone of Jango Fett,[8] Vill's programmed loyalty made him susceptible to following any order without question or moral regard. He was neither conflicted by the ethical dilemma of executing unarmed prisoners, nor bothered by the transporting of civilian families into slavery.[3] On the contrary, he adapted quickly to his new life as a stormtrooper. During the Clone Wars, Vill was concerned that the clones would be diminished as "glorified policemen" after the Separatists were defeated. Since the rise of the Empire necessitated further military operations, Vill was very pleased by the fact that the clones were still being used as soldiers.[7] Furthermore, Vill fully accepted the purpose and role of all cloned stormtroopers; they existed only to serve the Emperor until death. He felt empathy for his fellow clones to a certain extent, and believed that soldiers had to feel relevant—if only for the sake of troop morale.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vill</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVill</string></dict>
        <key>Barrison Draay</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1105.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Barrison Draay was a male Human Jedi Knight during the time of the Great Sith War. He was the husband of Krynda Draay and the father of Lucien Draay.
            Before joining the Jedi Order, Barrison was a financer who established the Draay Trust: A powerful holding company created to support non-Jedi Draays. He was a close friend of Haazen, his family steward, with whom he was a Padawan of Master Arca Jeth, and of Alok Adasca, head of Adascorp. Many people said he could not be a Jedi and still run the company or look after his workers, but he managed to do so.
            During their time as padawans, Haazen was often trying to capture a Nautolan smuggler named Dossa, but he failed each time. One time, Dossa blasted a pillar and made it come down on Haazen, but Barrison arrived and used the Force to suspend the pillar in the air, allowing Haazen to get out of the way. Also during their time as Padawans, the two of them became friends with another student: Krynda Hulis, padawan to Vodo-Siosk Baas. While both had feelings for her, Krynda only reciprocated Barrison's feelings.
            Eventually, Barrison and Krynda were both knighted by Arca Jeth, the Jedi Master saying he was pleased that his doubts about Barrison had been proven wrong. Haazen came into the ceremony and asked why he wasn't knighted. Master Jeth said Haazen's lack of discipline and orbiting the successes of his friends while not furthering his skills meant he had failed as a Jedi. After Haazen shouted at Master Jeth and stormed off, Barrison followed him. Haazen accused him of using his money to ensure he would get both Knighthood and Krynda. Barrison punched him for saying that, but quickly regretted it. He said he wouldn't interfere with the Order's decision, but that he would try to find a way Haazen could still serve him.
            Barrison was able to find a way for Haazen to continue his work: Haazen became his assistant.
            Barrison became a great Jedi warrior and during the Great Sith War, won the Battle of Toprawa. During the war, Haazen was a body man, separating friendly from enemy bodies. After the Battle of Toprawa, Haazen was approached by Dossa, who was now allied with the Sith and offered Haazen to get him anything he wanted. Haazen said he wanted the life Barrison had, money, Krynda, everything. Dossa had Haazen lead Barrison and his company of Jedi into the Ansharii Caverns, under the pretense of a remaining Sith base. Dossa detonated a bomb, killing everyone but Haazen, who lost his right eye, arm and legs, however.
            Although a good fighter, Barrison lacked any type of precognitive abilities that his wife had. She would later blame this lack of foresight for his death. Years after his death, Haazen would later say that his son, Lucien, had the same qualities.
            Unfortunately, because of Barrison's death, Krynda was consumed by sorrow and guilt for not foreseeing the coming of the Sith War. After years of training new students, she eventually created a Covenant dedicated to preventing the rise of the Sith at any cost. However, Haazen had been manipulating everyone behind the scenes.
            Lucien and his former Padawan Zayne Carrick dueled before Barrison's statue, which was damaged by orbital bombardment and collapsed on the former. Zayne then took the opportunity to impale the helpless Jedi. However, it turned to be a ruse to get close to Haazen to trust Zayne enough to let him get close to his gauntlet and cut it off. Lucien stated that his father would have never stood for what Haazen had done and used Haazen's dismembered mechanical hand to redirect Republic fire on the Estate. Lucien survived, despite the loss of his eyes. On a remote moon which Lucien bought, he assembled a True Covenant, combining both his parents beliefs, accepting that though prophecies can't be changed, they will at least endure as Jedi.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Barrison_Draay</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascBarrisonDraay</string></dict>
        <key>Vilim Disra</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1106.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vilim Disra was the Moff in charge of the Imperial Remnant's Braxant sector in 19 ABY. He was the lead man of a secret triumvirate comprised of himself, Imperial Guardsman Major Grodin Tierce and a con-artist named Flim. The regime was assembled in order to bring the New Republic into an internal civil war over the Bothan's involvement concerning the Caamas Document in order to keep the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet, then-Fleet Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, from successfully making peace with the New Republic. Previously, Disra had been a member of the Central Committee of Grand Moffs that supported Trioculus's claim to the Imperial throne.
            In 3 BBY, Disra became chief administrator of Shelsha sector, under Governor Barshnis Choard. In 0.5 ABY he double-crossed Choard, who wanted to orchestrate a secession of Shelsa from the Galactic Empire. For roughly two years, Disra worked with Choard and a mercenary named Caaldra to put together an allegiance of pirate gangs under the BloodScars and place them with the resources they would need to take over specific Imperial targets when the time came. Disra also managed to make contacts within the Rebel Alliance, pretending that Shelsha would ally with the Rebellion in exchange for the Alliance's help in defending Shelsha from the expected Imperial reprisal.[1]
            However, Disra was planning to betray Choard, Caaldra, and the Rebel Alliance all along. He kept detailed records of everything, so that when the time came he could turn over Choard to Lord Vader and present himself as a hero to the Empire. He succeeded in his plan, made easier because Lord Vader and his 501st Legion were already on Shelsha's capital of Shelkonwa due to a tip Disra had called in to Imperial Center informing Vader that Princess Leia Organa was in the city. Though Disra had the city under lockdown to prevent her escape, she managed to do so with the help of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, the Hand of Judgment, and—unwittingly—Mara Jade. Disra made it clear to Vader that he wished to be named Governor of Shelsha after Choard's removal, but Palpatine refused to do so.[1]
            At some point Disra sat on the Central Committee of Grand Moffs approximately a year after the Battle of Endor. Afterward, he was demoted (possibly for supporting Bertroff Hissa and Trioculus). He engaged in the maneuvering that resulted in the assassination of Grand Admiral Rufaan Tigellinus, allowing Disra to take his place at the Committee. In 11 ABY, he began searching for someone to impersonate Thrawn successfully, to use in a plan to overthrow the New Republic. By 19 ABY he was one of the eight members of the Council of Moffs.
            Disra later hired the con artist Flim to portray Grand Admiral Thrawn in order to consolidate Imperial military power under the command of a triumvirate consisting of Disra, Flim, and Major Grodin Tierce. Under the nominal leadership of Disra, the triumvirate laid out a plan to sabotage part of the planetary shield of Bothawui. Meanwhile, they manipulated hostilities arising from the discovery of a datacard implicating the Bothans in the post-Clone Wars bombardment of Caamas.[2]
            Disra also employed the services of pirate gangs, most notably the Cavrilhu gang under Captain Zothip. The Remnant loaned Zothip's gang leftover clones from Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic 10 years earlier, and in return was supplied with Preybird-class starfighters. The Preybirds were badly needed to augment the dwindling supply of TIE fighters in the Imperial Navy, and though far less intimidating, the Preybirds proved to be capable replacements. Disra hired the pirates to attack New Republic shipping convoys, letting Zothip's gang keep anything of value while forcing the New Republic to use valuable resources trying to stop the attacks. Disra used Zothip as a pawn until Zothip arrived at Disra's private office on Bastion with murderous intent. Fortunately for Disra, Zothip was killed by an assassin, a Mistryl Shadow Guard who had also sneaked into his estate.[2]
            Though Disra was the creator of the secret triumvirate, he never really controlled it. Major Tierce manipulated the group from the beginning. Disra planned betrayal, plotting to kill Tierce and Flim when it came time to do so. He was unaware that Tierce knew of this, but he was in constant disagreement with the soldier, whom he suspected of planning to usurp his leadership. Disra continually attempted to gain the upper hand over him, but never really succeeded. As the first shots over Bothawui were fired, it was revealed that Tierce was, in fact, an unstable clone from a failed project. Disra's triumvirate was laid bare by information procured by smuggler/information broker Talon Karrde and Disra was arrested on grounds of treason.[2]
            The Council of Moffs replaced him with Ephin Sarreti.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vilim_Disra</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascVilimDisra</string></dict>

            In 3643 BBY, Hiran was sent to the Sith Academy on Korriban to be trained as a Sith. He was able to complete his trials which impressed his father, who would then brag about his success to Kallig. Hiran believed that non-force users in the Sith Empire such as his father were nothing more than "pawns in [the Sith's] game", and considered aliens to be "scum". He later returned to Balmorra to help his father on several missions. When he was able to find a holocron, he was suddenly captured by Republic forces when Iannos Tyrek betrayed the Empire.
            While captured, his father sent Sith Inquisitor Kallig who was here to search for an artifact of Tulak Hord. He expressed his disdain towards his father to the Inquisitor, and demanded to be released. The Inquisitor refused, and attempted to seal Hiran in the cell he was in with a blast of force lightning. Hiran escaped, and fought the Inquisitor in an intense duel. Though he fought competently, he was ultimately no match for the combined forces of Kallig and Khem Val.
            If the player chooses to free Hiran, he will mock the player saying that the Inquisitor and his father are both weak. He says his father didn't mention that the player is a "filthy alien" if the player is any species that isn't Human, Sith, or cyborg.
            Hiran Bessiker uses primarily Sith Warrior attacks, as well as Force Shock.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hiran_Bessiker</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascHiranBessiker</string></dict>
        <key>Darth Arho</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1108.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Darth Arho was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith and a Dark Councilor of the reconstituted Sith Empire. His strong frame, added to his bald head, gave him an intimidating appearance.
            As a Sith Lord, he was extremely ruthless and when he journeyed to Ilum during the Cold War, he went with the single goal of obliterating his enemies: the Jedi, and the Republic. His tenure on the Dark Council was brief but memorable, ascending to the Dark Council after the death and betrayal of Darth Baras. The blows struck against the Sith Emperor by the Jedi Order only drove Darth Arho to push even harder for the final defeat of the Republic.
            Darth Arho stayed away from the powerplays of other Dark Councilors and his warlike personality was often used by Councilors against one another. He proved himself on Ilum to be a capable commander, however, the Dark Council disapproved of his willingness to win at all costs. But this attitude changed after the Empire's catastrophic loss during the Battle of Corellia when Darth Arho was selected by the Dark Council to lead the Operation Dark Ice, which would come to be known as the Battle of Ilum.
            The initial landing was marked with heavy Imperial casualties as Grand Moff Ilyan Regus' forces struggled adapting to Ilum's harsh environments. Regus petitioned the Dark Council for help. Under his and Arho's command, the Empire began to make considerable advances; Admiral Shai and Jedi Master Jaric Kaedan were killed and the Jedi Temple was captured.
            By this point, Supreme Commander Rans had called on the Republic's own heroes to respond to Ilum's plight. Seeking to quickly end the conflict, Darth Arho led an assault on the Republic's headquarters on the planet, capturing the command staff included the Supreme Commander. Victory seemed to be within the grasp of the Empire, but unbeknownst to the Sith, Darth Malgus had been feeding the Republic information on their movements to kill his primary rival, Darth Arho. The Republic heroes managed to free Rans, but not before capturing Arho's apprentice Lord Loyat. With the help of Malgus' information, the Republic heroes managed to finally put an end to Darth Arho. Unbeknownst to them, this allowed Malgus to seize control of Darth Arho's resources, including the stealth armada, allowing him to create his New Empire.
            Darth Arho was talented in lightsaber combat as well as a powerful dark side user. Arho was able to use Force choke to hold his opponents, as well as Force drain to kill either enemies or allies and use their energy to heal himself and make him stronger.
            Darth Arho made his only appearance in Star Wars: The Old Republic.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Arho</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascDarthArho</string></dict>
        <key>Alpha-66</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1109.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Alpha-66, was an Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commando in the Grand Army of the Republic who fought in the Clone Wars and took the name Muzzle during the closing stages of the war. After the end of the Clone Wars and the establishment of the Galactic Empire, Muzzle went on to organize his own mercenary group, the Aurodium Sword, offering his services as a bodyguard and a gun-for-hire to employers criminal and Imperial alike. However, Muzzle's treatment of Wookiees and other aliens as equal beings found him at odds with Imperial pro-Human politics.
            Clone trooper Alpha-66[2] was one of the numerous clones of the bounty hunter Jango Fett created on the planet Kamino to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic. Although most of Fett's clones were genetically altered to be more obedient to their Jedi commanders,[1] Alpha-66 was one of the Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commandos,[2] an elite group of one hundred clones produced from Fett's unaltered genome and trained by Fett himself. As a result, Muzzle inherited all of Fett's combat skills, but also his loner personality streak.[3] Alpha-66 fought in the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, adopting the name "Muzzle" during the final stages of the conflict.[4]
            After the end of the war and the reformation of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, all surviving ARCs were offered retirement. Some of them agreed and trained their successors, the stormtroopers, at the Imperial Academy; others decided to follow in their progenitor's footsteps and operate on their own. Muzzle chose the latter option, founding the Aurodium Sword mercenary group[2]—named after the aurodium mineral[5]—offering protection to captains of industry and heads of state. The Aurodium Sword was staffed mainly by Humans, Ubese, and fierce Wookiee warriors such as the bounty hunter Snoova. Muzzle's organization was known to take jobs for clients both criminal and Imperial, such as the Sienar family.[2]
            On one occasion, Muzzle, Snoova, and another Wookiee defended a Sullustan executive against an industrial assassin droid. Muzzle and the Aurodium Sword were still active shortly after the Battle of Yavin. As part of its program of tracking rogue Fett clones, the Rogue Cell of the Imperial Security Bureau kept a close eye on Muzzle and his organization, considering their loyalty to the Empire to be undecided. The Imperial agents, however, were concerned with Muzzle's treatment of Wookiees[2] and other species[4] as equal beings, which clashed with the Empire's humanocentristic views.[2]
            A grizzled Clone Wars veteran,[2] recognized for his service in the Republic army even by Imperial military personnel,[4] Muzzle inherited Jango Fett's sense of adventure and contempt to any form of authority.[5] By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Muzzle was considered atypically long-lived for a clone.[6] Although the Empire treated other species, especially Wookiees, as inferior to Humans, Muzzle considered them equal in every sense, causing some concern for the Imperial Security Bureau with such views,[2] a fact that he was aware of.[4] At some point in his life, he received a prominent X-shaped scar across his forehead. Muzzle wore a combined armor set—while the upper half was ARC trooper armor, complete with a pauldron; the lower half came from the Naboo Palace Guard uniform.[2] Such a combination offered him both good protection and freedom of movement, as Muzzle's experience had taught him that sometimes it was better to run as fast as possible. While choosing the name for his organization, Muzzle wanted it to project an aura of class, intelligence, and purity, and he eventually settled upon the valuable aurodium.[5]
            The character of Alpha-66 was conceived by Ryan Kaufman for his and Abel G. Peña's article Underworld: A Galaxy of Scum and Villainy, which was published in Star Wars Insider 89 in August of 2006. Joe Corroney provided the artwork depicting Muzzle for the article. Kaufman came up with the concept of a clone trooper veteran backed by Wookiee warriors when he witnessed his five-year-old son, Max, playing with action figures of a clone trooper commander and three Wookiees. As Kaufman had an unofficial agreement with Karen Traviss, the author of the Republic commando novel series, which prevented him from using Null-class Advanced Recon Commandos and clone commandos, he decided to make his character an Alpha-class ARC, a concept he had co-developed with Haden Blackman and that he had wanted to explore for a long time. Kaufman was very pleased with Corroney's artistic interpretation of Muzzle. Muzzle's grim determination, graying temples, and the X-shaped scar reminded Kaufman of Detective John Hartigan from the Sin City: That Yellow Bastard comic book series by Frank Miller.[5] Muzzle later received an entry in the 2008 The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia by Stephen Sansweet and Pablo Hidalgo.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alpha-66</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascAlpha66</string></dict>

        <key>Zorta Bingan</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1111.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Zorta Bingan was a human male who served as an officer in the Imperial Officer Corps in the early days of the Galactic Empire. Following a conspiracy against Darth Vader, Bingan, along with four other officers, were killed, with Vader stating that although he had suspicions on the conspirators, he would always survive.
            Zorta Bingan was an human male who served as an Imperial officer in the Imperial Officer Corps. Following an attempted assassination on Darth Vader on Cabarria by bounty hunters, Vader ordered his droid to conduct an analysis of the origins of the kill contract as they were arriving on Coruscant. The droid stated that the contract came from the highest levels of the Imperial Executive Building, including the offices of Emperor Palpatine. The droid continued, and stated that there was a 97% probability that the signal originated from there, and that there was no evidence of slicing.[1]
            Vader then requested a list of individuals with access codes of Imperial systems that were above Level 1A1. On the list provided, Bingan's name was listed there, along with the names of Corin Ferro, Wilhuff Tarkin, Cassio Tagge, Jer Croteau, Tomas Azoras, and Joon Strephi. Following a second assassination attempt in Coruscant's orbit that resulted in Vader and the Ninth Sister crashing their starship, Vader met with the Emperor and meditated and discovered that Barokki was also involved, an officer he had force choked some time before. Vader then approached the Emperor with a possible solution.[1]
            Bingan and many other officers were rallied to an auditorium on Coruscant. Vader believed that the conspiracy against him was because the officers did not understand why Vader was Emperor Palpatine's second in command. Following a brief speech by Emperor Palpatine that elaborated that Vader was his second in command, Vader "randomly" selected Bingan, along with Ferro, Azoras, Barokki, and Strephi and killed them through the Force, and stated that although he had suspicions on the conspirators, he would always survive. Of those killed, Barokki was one of two officers that were involved in the conspiracy, the other, who was an individual with two missing fingers was not selected and thus spared.[1]
            Bingan's last name is misspelled "Bingaw" on Vader's list.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zorta_Bingan</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascZortaBingan</string></dict>
        <key>Azkul</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1112.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Azkul was a Sith veteran of the Jedi Civil War who later became a mercenary in the employ of the Exchange.
            Azkul served under Darth Malak during the Jedi Civil War as a Sith commando in an elite Sith Special Forces detachment. A good many former military personnel—Republic and Sith alike—suddenly found themselves out of a job with the end of the war. Many of them, with no homes left to return to, turned to mercenary work, including Azkul. He journeyed to Dantooine and began making plans to overthrow the lawful Republic government there with his mercenary army.
            In 3951 BBY, he was hired by the Exchange to assassinate the Khoonda Administrator Terena Adare so Dantooine could be used for further illegal activities by the crime syndicate. Unfortunately for Azkul and his mercenaries, Meetra Surik and the Jedi Master Vrook Lamar were on the planet. Azkul had a small team capture Vrook (though Vrook allowed himself to be captured to figure out what the mercenaries were planning), the team was ambushed by Surik and her allies. When she came out of the crystal cave, Azkul tried to recruit Surik. She refused and the former Sith commando sent his group against her, but they too were easily dispatched.
            At Khoonda, Surik and Vrook, with their combined efforts, were able to rally the settlers and conform a stronger militia, repair the inactive Battle droids and autoturrets (and strengthening them to be as damaging, accurate, and durable as possible) and strengthen the minefields around the administration building, which caused heavy casualties. They also used Surik's computer expertise to reprogram the droids and the turrets which previously fired on everything to only target the attackers, which saved militia who would later help in the breach of the Khoonda. Surik also sealed the door to the armory, which caused Azkul to be forced to attack through the main militia force. Azkul, his right-hand man Dopak, and eight to ten of his men remained alive for a final assault on the administrator, but he was betrayed by Dopak and finally defeated.
            If Surik helps Azkul invade Khoonda, he later appears on Citadel Station, aiding the Telos Security Force in their fight against the Sith forces.
            Surik can also manipulate Azkul into thinking that she will help him, which will be admired by Kreia. Mandalore the Preserver would give caution on how Azkul knows who to trust because he knew his kind. Teammates who have very strong senses in justice will despise such an act, though, while Brianna will instantly despise joining Azkul to where which response results in being influence-related.

        <key>Raymus Antilles</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1113.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Raymus Antilles was a male Human and the captain of the corvette Sundered Heart at the time of the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. He served the Royal Alderaan Civil Fleet under Senator Bail Prestor Organa. During the early stages of the Civil War, he served the Rebel Alliance in the fight against the Galactic Empire. He captained the Alderaan Diplomatic Cruiser Tantive IV before his death in 0 BBY at the hands of Darth Vader.
            Raymus Antilles was a male Human from the peaceful planet of Alderaan,[6] one of the so-called Core Worlds of the Galactic Republic.[7] He was a member of the prominent House of Antilles and the uncle of Corla Metonae.[8] Although he belonged to the same family as Breha, Queen of Alderaan, he himself held no title. During his formative years, Antilles learned how to pilot under the guidance of his mentor, Captain Jeremoch Colton.[6]
            At the time of the Clone Wars, Raymus Antilles had reached the rank of captain and was entrusted with piloting the Sundered Heart, the consular vessel for Senator Bail Prestor Organa.[9]
            Following the transmission of Order 66, Captain Antilles recovered a Jedi homing beacon, encountering no opposition from clone troopers as they were still confused by the ordeal. The beacon helped Bail Organa locate Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Antilles transported the Jedi back to Coruscant, and later ferried the weary Masters to the medical center of Polis Massa.[10]
            When Bail Organa returned to Alderaan aboard the Sundered Heart, it was in the company of the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, as well as his newly-adopted child, Leia. To preserve the secret of the girl's true parentage, Bail Organa ordered Antilles to have C-3PO's memory wiped,[10] though R2-D2 managed to avoid this fate.[11]
            Over the next nineteen years, Captain Antilles continued to command the Tantive IV, but was separated from C-3PO and R2-D2 until almost immediately before 0 BBY.
            Early during the Galactic Civil War, Raymus Antilles, now a member of the Rebel Alliance, was granted property of the Sundered Heart as a gift for running aid and medical supplies past several Imperial blockades. He took that ship for some of his most dangerous missions instead of the Tantive IV.[12] In 1 BBY, he gave his support to the Star Tours travel agency, which was being re–launched under new management. To assist in the preparations for the first flight from the brand new Spaceport THX1138, Captain Antilles assigned C-3PO and R2-D2 to temporarily work for the company. However, after the first flight was ambushed by Imperial forces conducting a raid on THX1138 and the escorting of a Rebel agent to the Rebels, he quietly had C-3PO and R2-D2 returned to him from Star Tours.[13]
            While on Dantooine, Antilles lost R2-D2 in a game of sabacc against the Lorrdian Pike Angeles. Angeles, a technician who wanted to be deployed in the field, agreed to return the astromech in exchange for a field commission. Antilles agreed. R2-D2 returned to his custody and Pike Angeles was free to begin a career stealing starships for the Alliance.[14]
            In the battle of Kuat that same year, Antilles personally destroyed six Imperial shipyards in orbit of the planet, in order to begin the operation of stealing the X-wing prototypes. He also attacked a fleet of Imperial ships transporting Incom scientists to the spice mines of Kessel, saving them from certain death. He was involved in many other missions for the Rebel cause. Later, while back in command of the Tantive IV, he was part of the mission which intercepted plans for the Death Star.
            During the Battle of Tatooine, he commanded Blue Squadron from the bridge of the Tantive IV. His passage through the system was interrupted when a nearby Interdictor cruiser activated its gravity well projector, preventing their escape and allowing the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator to capture his ship.[15] As the ship was boarded, Antilles led his men into the main passageway, meeting Leia Organa. He ordered her into an escape pod, as she had the Death Star plans. The senator suggested they use a droid instead.[16]
            The 501st Legion stormed the ship, and he was captured and taken to Darth Vader. The Sith Lord strangled Antilles to death (without the Force) after he refused to give information on the location of the Death Star plans, and attempted to claim that the Tantive IV was a consular ship on a diplomatic mission. Angered by Antilles's refusal to give up the location of the plans, as well as Antilles's death just as Vader demanded to know where the "ambassador" of the ship was due to his crushing his neck, the Dark Lord threw his body against a wall.[2]
            Raymus Antilles was level-headed, schooled in diplomacy, and a capable pilot. He was a strong Rebel Alliance sympathizer and skilled at running Imperial blockades, but he lacked experience leading ground troops.[12] Antilles demonstrated his loyalty to the Alliance by giving his life rather than giving up the Death Star plans.
            When he served aboard the Sundered Heart, he wore the iconic gray uniform of an Alderaanian starship captain and carried a target blaster.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Raymus_Antilles/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascRaymusAntilles</string></dict>
        <key>SG-1984</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1114.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>SG-1984 was the designation of a commando who served in the Senate Guard during the Clone Wars. He was part of the security detail that protected Supreme Chancellor Palpatine at the Festival of Light on the planet Naboo.
            SG-1984 was stationed in the Royal Palace of Theed along with other members of the Senate Guard and the clone shock troopers of Coruscant Guard. Their assignment was to ensure the safety of the Galactic Republic's executive head of state, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, while he hosted the Festival of Light on his homeworld of Naboo. Part of the Chancellor's security included a domed ray shield that covered the stage during the celebration. While patrolling the staircase that led to the stage, SG-1984 encountered the Parwan bounty hunter Derrown, one of several mercenaries hired to abduct Palpatine by Count Dooku of the Separatist Alliance.[1]
            With the aid of Sinrich's holographic technology, Derrown disguised himself as a Senate Commando. SG-1984 was deceived by the bounty hunter's facade, and thus failed to prevent him from deactivating the ray shield. The plot failed due to the efforts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Jedi operative who infiltrated Dooku's mercenary group as Rako Hardeen.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/SG-1984/Legends</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascSG1984</string></dict>
        <key>B'arin Apma</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1115.01</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>B'arin Apma was a Human male who was one of the seventy-five Mandalorian warriors that were selected by Jango Fett to help train elite clones on Kamino, as part of the one hundred members of the Cuy'val Dar.
            Brotherhood, stamina, loyalty. These were the three pillars upon which B'arin Apma rested his entire life. These were also the three main tenets that he drilled into the clone troopers he trained. He believed these were as essential to a superior soldier as marksmanship and courage.
            B'arin Apma was created for an exclusive Entertainment Earth 7 action figure pack.
            The actual figure comes with a Mitrinomon Z-6 jetpack instead of the Merr-Sonn JT-12 jetpack style shown in the promo pictures and box art. It is suspected the figure may have originally been intended to be Walon Vau, but the head did not fit the character so the idea may have been scrapped.
            This figure has an all-new head, all-new legs, and arms and a torso taken from existing Jango Fett action figures. Arms were modified to remove the flame-thrower projectile and grappling line. Legs were modified by removing the Jango holsters, and uses the newer multi-articulate jointed system. The arms are not multi-jointed.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/B%27arin_Apma</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsHumanMascB'arinApma</string></dict>
