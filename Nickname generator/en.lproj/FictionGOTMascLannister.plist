        <key>Amory Lorch</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.1.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Amory Lorch was a knight in the service of House Lannister during the War of the Five Kings. He was killed by Jaqen H'ghar in Harrenhal at the behest of Arya Stark.
            Ser Amory Lorch is a landed knight of House Lorch, a knightly house sworn to House Lannister. He has been a loyal vassal of the Lannisters for many years. The sigil of his House is a black manticore on a red field.[1]
            Off screen, Lorch is raiding in the Riverlands when he is approached by a pair of goldcloaks with a royal warrant for the royal bastard Gendry. The goldcloaks request assistance from Lorch to capture the boy who has been protected by Yoren and his Night's Watch recruits.
            On screen, the goldcloaks along with Lorch and a force of Lannister solders return to Yoren's group. Lorch confronts Yoren and attacks his group when Yoren refuses to give up Gendry. Lorch kills Yoren personally after his men have subdued him and then imprisons the survivors, ordering them to be taken to Harrenhal. He does not realize that Arya Stark and Gendry are among them. He questions them about Gendry and is tricked into believing that the slain Lommy Greenhands was his target because he was carrying Gendry's bull's head helmet.[2]
            Lorch and his men deliver the prisoners to Ser Gregor Clegane at Harrenhal. Ser Gregor oversees the torture of the captives, killing several of them. When Lord Tywin Lannister returns to Harrenhal he ends the interrogations and orders the prisoners put to work, criticizing his men for wasting valuable manpower.[3]
            Lorch attends a war council held by Lord Tywin. Tywin criticizes his men for underestimating Robb Stark and demands that they devise a new strategy. Lorch reports rumors from spies that there is discontent in Robb's camp. Tywin is dismissive, saying that discontent is a part of war and that the very same spies would report the same from the Lannister side.[4]
            Ser Amory is chastised by Lord Tywin during a war council after the knight's illiteracy means that a letter meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand is instead accidentally sent to Lord Marlin of House Dormund, a vassal of House Stark. Exasperated, Tywin remarks that "my cupbearer reads better than you!" Later, Amory catches Arya Stark with a stolen letter and tries to seize her, and then heads to inform Tywin. Frantically, Arya seeks out the assassin Jaqen H'ghar and names Amory as her next kill. Ser Amory is killed with a poisoned dart to the neck dipped in wolfsbane just as he enters Lord Tywin's chambers. Tywin mistakes it for an assassination attempt on himself.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Amory Lorch is a noted servant of Lord Tywin Lannister and a member of House Lorch, a knightly house sworn to Casterly Rock. He is described as a portly man of average height. He has a pale piggy face with small pig-like eyes, and a high, thin voice.
            According to a semi-canon source, during the Reyne-Tarbeck rebellion, Lorch threw the last Lord Tarbeck, a three year old boy, down a well.
            During the Sack of King's Landing at the end of Robert's Rebellion, Ser Amory Lorch and Ser Gregor Clegane were assigned to eliminate the last scions of House Targaryen, breaking into the royal apartments and brutally killing Prince Rhaegar's wife, Elia Martell, and their children, Aegon and Rhaenys, an act that has marred the reputation of both.
            Lorch killed Rhaenys by stabbing her about fifty times, even Tywin considering the manner of her death to be overly brutal. He asked Lorch why killing a four year old girl required so many thrusts, and Lorch answered that she kicked him and would not stop screaming. Tywin commented that if Lorch had half the brain a turnip has, he would have calmed Rhaenys with a few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow to smother her. In the TV series, it is not mentioned that he was involved in the killing of Rhaenys, her murder instead being attributed to Gregor Clegane.
            Considering he is not responsible for the killing of Princess Rhaenys and his backstory is cut from the TV series, Lorch is generally perceived as being less cruel than his book counterpart.
            Lorch is known for pillaging places in random, regardless if their owners are loyal to the Lannisters or not, simply because he can. One of his victims was Ser Roger Hogg, a bannerman of House Hayford. Ser Roger told Lorch that to which house his fealty was owed, but Lorch wouldn't listen, slaughtered half of Ser Roger's sheep and three milk goats, then tried to roast him alive in his tower. The tower walls were solid stone and eight feet thick, so after the fire burned out Lorch rode off bored.
            In the books, Ser Amory comes into conflict with Yoren while hunting down the Brotherhood Without Banners instead of Gendry. Although Yoren assures Lorch multiple times that his caravan has nothing to do with the Brotherhood, Lorch picks a fight with him anyway without provocation or reason.
            There is no mention in the books that Lorch is illiterate.
            Lorch is not one of the names Arya gives to Jaqen, and was not killed by him. After Roose Bolton took Harrenhal, he and Vargo Hoat, who had a running rivalry with Amory, had Lorch thrown into the bear pit, where he was torn apart. Arya considered that poetic vengeance for Yoren's murder, as she had thought of Yoren as hairy and tough, like a bear.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Amory_Lorch</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascAmoryLorch</string></dict>
        <key>Lucan </key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.2.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lucan is a guard working for the Lannisters in King's Landing.
            Lucan first appears when Mira Forrester attempts to sneak into the gardens at midnight to meet with an unknown person who left a note in her room. Lucan spots her and demands that she returns to her chambers. However, Damien then arrives and assures Lucan that Mira is with him, and Lucan begrudgingly allows her to stay.
            Lucan is later seen searching for Damien after he attacks Mira and is either killed or left with Tom.[1]
            At the royal wedding, Lucan is on guard duty when he again encounters Mira with Sera Flowers. He demands to know what she was doing with Damien in the garden and tries to detain her, but he is prevented by Lord Morgryn, who intentionally bumps into him and spills wine over his clothes. Morgryn then requests Mira's help to Lucan's initial refusal, until Morgryn reminds him of their different social statuses. Lucan then reluctantly leaves Mira and returns to his watch.[2]
            Lucan seeks out Mira Forrester on behalf of Cersei Lannister and brings the handmaiden to the queen. Cersei reveals that Lucan spotted Mira at Tommen's coronation festival.
            Lucan later escorts Mira to Tyrion's cell, giving her wine to help loosen his tongue. When Tyrion figures out that Mira was sent by Cersei, Lucan storms in, berating her. Shortly thereafter, he grabs Mira and forcefully removes her from the cell.[3]
            Betrayed by Morgryn, Mira is handed over to Lucan, he locked her up in a cell and wait for execution.[4]

        <key>Alton Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.3.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Alton Lannister was a young knight from a cadet branch of House Lannister and a captive of the Northern armies alongside his cousin, Ser Jaime Lannister. He is sent to deliver Robb Stark's peace terms to King's Landing, and he is killed by Jaime Lannister inside a prison cell at Robb Stark's camp.
            Ser Alton is a cousin of Cersei Lannister, Jaime Lannister and Tyrion Lannister. His relationship to the main branch of the family is not clear. He fights for House Lannister against House Stark in the Battle of the Whispering Wood and is captured by the Stark army.
            Soon after news of King Joffrey Baratheon's bastardy reaches the Northern camp, Robb Stark tells Ser Alton his terms for a peace with the Iron Throne, and then sends him to King's Landing to deliver them to the Queen Regent. Ser Alton remarks that Robb's demand for the return of Sansa and Arya as well as Ned Stark's bones and the remains of all the Stark household, is an honorable request, but expresses doubt and surprise when Robb also demands that the independence of the North and Riverlands be respected. He also tries to remind Robb that Joffrey is a Baratheon, to which Robb replies, "Is he?"[1]
            Ser Alton delivers the Stark peace terms, which are rejected by Queen Cersei. Cersei sends him back with the Iron Throne's reply. Cersei also asks him to tell Jaime that he has not been forgotten. Tyrion wishes Alton a safe journey.[2]
            He returns to the Westerlands to inform Robb of Cersei's response, and Robb asks that he return to his old pen but the prisoners are far too many that they have occupied it. Alton is placed in the Kingslayer's cell, until a new pen can be built. He tells Jaime that his mother is Cynda Lannister at which Jaime, not knowing who that is, asks if she is the fat one.
            Alton mentions squiring for Ser Jaime at the tourney during Willem Frey's wedding. He says that he was such a minor relation to the Lannisters that they were put at a table so far away he could barely see the bride and that his father was furious at Alton's volunteering to be a replacement squire as he might embarrass their lesser branch of the family before the major one. At first Jaime doesn't remember until reminded that his squire Brian had become so sick he threw up on his own horse. He then remembers that Alton had been a much better squire than Jaime himself had been and shares his experience of squiring for Barristan Selmy when he was sixteen, fighting the Kingswood Brotherhood.
            Alton asks if Jaime has ever thought of escaping imprisonment. When Jaime replies that he has a plan, Alton agrees to help and gets close to hear what he is to do. Jaime whispers to him the one thing he has to do is to die, then headbutts him and beats him repeatedly with his shackles. Torrhen Karstark enters the cell to check the convulsing Alton, allowing Jaime to get behind him and strangle him with his chains. Getting the key from his belt, he frees himself from the chains and escapes from the cell.[3]
            Although Alton is never mentioned again by name, his death is alluded to by Jaime on at least two occasions after he returns to King's Landing. First, when he argues with Cersei about how he murdered people so that he could get back to her,[4] and later when Tyrion is running down the list of names for the various types of familial killing before his trial by combat and sardonically declares there is no type of killing that doesn't have its own word; Jaime guiltily replies, "Cousins." Tyrion thinks on this a moment and concedes his brother is right, there is no word for cousin-killing.[5]
            When confronting the High Sparrow, Jaime Lannister sarcastically asks why he isn't punished for his sins, like his sister was and admits he tells him that he killed his own cousin.[6]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character by this name. The character Cleos Frey has the role of being a captive of House Stark and delivering terms to House Lannister. Cleos Frey is the son of Ser Emmon Frey, Walder Frey's second son, and Genna Lannister, the only sister of Tywin Lannister. His name appears to have been changed so that TV viewers would not be confused that he is on the Lannisters' side, despite House Frey officially declaring for Robb Stark.
            While Alton does serve in the same role as Cleos Frey in the books, it is later made clear that he is not the son of Genna Lannister as he mentions his mother is Cynda Lannister, whom Jaime has difficulty remembering. Thus "Alton Lannister" isn't as important a familial relation as Cleos Frey is; he is not Lord Tywin's nephew and Jaime's first cousin the way Cleos is in the books.
            Besides being the courier in negotiating peace terms, Cleos Frey also has in common with Alton Lannister that he takes part in the two escape attempts of Jaime Lannister. When Tyrion Lannister sends Cleos back with Eddard's bones and the Lannister terms for peace to Robb Stark, there are four men mixed in with the other escorting soldiers that are there to break Jaime out. One does impressions and imitates Edmure Tully ordering the gate raised, but the real Edmure was returning from a brothel in town and the escape is foiled. Cleos swore he knew nothing about the escape plan, but Edmure did not believe him and ordered to lock him in the cell where Jaime was previously kept, claiming that Cleos is "half Lannister, half Frey, and all liar". When Cleos was brought before Catelyn, he fearfully swore he had no idea about Tyrion's plan. Catelyn Stark did not care much if he was telling the truth or not, and demanded to know what peace terms the Lannisters offered them. After Cleos told her the terms he brought, Catelyn asked about her daughters. He answered evasively, but after Catelyn threatened to hang him - he told her the truth that he only saw Sansa.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Alton_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascAltonLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Weasel</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.4.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Weasel is a servant of Ser Gregor Clegane.
            Weasel is a servant of Ser Gregor Clegane.
            Weasel aids the Tickler in the interrogation and torture of prisoners in Harrenhal. While the Tickler asks questions, Weasel straps the victim, and then places a wooden bucket with a rat inside over the victim's bare chest. At the Tickler's command, Weasel begins to heat the bucket with a torch to make the rat claw its way out through the victim's chest.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Weese is the understeward of the Wailing Tower in Harrenhal and a servant of House Whent that later submits to House Lannister. He is a cruel and abusive man, resorting to violence at the slightest provocation, even just for staring at him. He treats Arya and other servants very brutally. He, not Amory Lorch, is the second man whom Arya tells Jaqen H'ghar to kill, because he was mean to her.
            "Weasel" is a different character, a little girl about two years old whose real name is unknown. She and a woman whose right hand was cut off, perhaps her mother, were found by Yoren on the march north from King's Landing. The one-armed woman died shortly afterwards, leaving the girl in the custody of the caravan. When the Mountain and his men caught Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy Greenhands, Weasel managed to escape, and has not been seen since then. Arya takes her name as an alias while at the castle. For the TV series, the young girl Weasel has been removed and the name given to Weese.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Weasel</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascWeasel</string></dict>
        <key>Harys Swyft</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.5.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Harys Swyft is the head of House Swyft, a knightly house sworn to the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.
            Ser Harys Swyft is the Knight of Cornfield and the head of House Swyft, a knightly house of the Westerlands. He is the father of Dorna Swyft, the wife of Ser Kevan Lannister.
            Ser Harys is present for a strategy meeting assembled by Lord Tywin Lannister following the defeat and capture of Ser Jaime Lannister in the Battle of the Whispering Wood. Also present are Tyrion Lannister, Ser Kevan Lannister, Lord Leo Lefford, Ser Addam Marbrand, and another bannerman, as well as Tywin's servants. Ser Harys remains quiet while the other bannermen discuss their next move. When Tywin grows exasperated and dismisses the council, Ser Harys departs along with everyone present, except for Tyrion, whom Tywin orders to stay.[1]
            The episode doesn't identify any of the bannermen present in the episode and their identities are conjectures based on lines spoken, age of the actor, costume and the overall blocking of the scene, all of them compared to the books. The only two unaccounted bannermen from the books are Ser Harys and Ser Flement Brax. As the latter is a younger character, second son of Lord Andros Brax, it is safe to assume the unidentified bannerman sitting next to Ser Kevan is meant to stand in for Harys Swyft.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Harys Swyft is present at the council following Jaime's capture and is the one who considers suing for peace. His lines are given to both Kevan Lannister and Leo Lefford. Swyft is generally somewhat unintelligent, however, he does have some semblance of political sense: when a young Tywin Lannister returned from the War of the Ninepenny Kings and immediately started to call in his father's debts, Ser Harys hastened to comply with his demands, correctly realizing that "the Lion has awoken."
            Tyrion Lannister dismisses Ser Harys as a shameless lickspittle whose only achievement is marrying off his daughter to Kevan Lannister. Other Lannisters share Tyrion's low opinion of Ser Harys: Cersei once remarked that he should have adopted a worm as his personal sigil, as she considered a chicken (the emblematic animal of House Swyft) to be too brave a creature for him, and thinks that even the contents of her chamber pot are more able than him; Tywin's sister Genna, upon hearing that Cersei burned the Tower of the Hand, commented that Cersei should have burned Ser Harys instead.
            Harys is with Tywin's army when they take Harrenhal. During their time there he manages to alienate the cooks, who spit in his food. His squire is killed in an argument with the Brave Companions over the supposed death of Lord Beric Dondarrion. Arya watches him kiss Vargo Hoat under Tywin's orders to make up and put the conflict behind them.
            During the Battle of the Blackwater, Harys is trapped beneath his horse after it falls on him, but is rescued by one of his men-at-arms.
            After Tywin's death, Cersei Lannister appoints Ser Harys as her puppet Hand of the King, instead of leaving the position vacant as in the show, because he is both weak and a hostage for Kevan's good behavior. Jaime is incredulous at the appointment, as he considers Ser Harys to be a "toad".
            During the meetings of the Small Council, Ser Harys appears totally confused and clueless. When hearing that the Mountain's skull will soon be delivered to the Martells, he foolishly asks if that means the Mountain is dead. Aurane Waters answers him sarcastically he probably is, for removing the head from the body is often mortal. Ser Harys does not seem to undersrand he has been ridiculed.
            Later, Ser Harys is demoted to the position of Master of Coin. Following Cersei's downfall, Ser Harys and Pycelle take control of the council and request that Kevan return to King's Landing as regent.
            In the fifth novel, Ser Harys continues to serve as lord treasurer. In order to placate the Iron Bank, he writes to the bankers of Myr and the magisters of Pentos in hopes of a loan. When that fails, he suggests to raise taxes, but Kevan refuses since the realm is too full of rebellion and half its lords cannot tell taxation from tyranny. Instead, Kevan sends him to Braavos to negotiate the Crown's debt with the Iron Bank, a role taken by Mace Tyrell in the show. He is accompanied by several Lannister guards, one of them is Rafford (in the show he is replaced by Meryn Trant).</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Harys_Swyft</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascHarysSwyft</string></dict>
        <key>Willem Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.6.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Willem Lannister, along with his brother Martyn, was a squire in the Lannister army. Both were younger sons of Ser Kevan Lannister, and younger brothers of Lancel Lannister.
            Willem, along with his brother Martyn, is captured by the forces of House Tully led by Edmure Tully following the Battle of Stone Mill. The two are kept as hostages at Riverrun, the seat of the Tullys.
            After Robb Stark visits Riverrun to attend the funerals of Lord Hoster Tully, Willem and Martyn are visited in their cell by Queen Talisa Stark, who tends to Martyn's wounded hand. Willem looks in silence while Martyn asks if the tales told among the Lannisters about Robb turning into a wolf at night or devouring his enemies are true.[1]
            Martyn and Willem are murdered inside their cells by Lord Rickard Karstark in retribution for his son being killed by Jaime Lannister, and in defiance of Robb Stark's orders. Rickard is consequently executed for treason by Robb, causing the Karstarks to desert Robb's cause.[2]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Willem and Martyn are the twin sons of Ser Kevan Lannister, and younger brothers of Lancel Lannister. He and his cousin Tion Frey - son of Genna Lannister and Emmon Frey - are captured at the Battle of the Whispering Wood. Later, Willem and Tion are killed by Rickard Karstark.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Willem_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascWillemLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Tommen II Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.7.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Tommen II Lannister was a member of House Lannister who ruled the Westerlands as King of the Rock.
            Tommen Lannister, the Second of His Name, ruled the Kingdom of the Rock after the Doom of Valyria. He led an expedition to the Valyrian Peninsula from which he never returned. He carried with him the Valyrian steel sword Brightroar, which was lost with him.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, King Tommen II is briefly mentioned. In The World of Ice and Fire his story is briefly expanded. The last report of him is a Volantene chronicle titled The Glory of Volantis which mentions a "golden fleet" bearing the "Lion King" stayed at Volantis for supplies, and that the triarchs showered him with gifts. According to the chronicle, Tommen II swore that half of all he would find would be given to the triarchs in return for their generosity and the promise to send their fleet to his aid when he requested it. Afterward he sailed away. The next year, the chronicle states that Triarch Marqelo Tagaros dispatched a squadron toward Valyria to find any sign of Tommen's golden fleet, but returned empty handed.
            Tommen II apparently lived a few years or few decades after the Doom of Valyria, which was itself a century before the Targaryen Conquest of Westeros. It is said that the Lannisters acquired Brightroar in the century before the Doom, and that Tommen II disappeared a little over a century after that.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tommen_II_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascTommenIILannister</string></dict>
        <key>Tytos Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.8.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Tytos Lannister was the Lord of Casterly Rock and head of House Lannister. He was the grandfather of Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion Lannister.
            Tytos was once Lord of Casterly Rock and head of House Lannister, one of the Great Houses of Westeros. The Lannisters are the richest and one of the most influential families in Westeros. He is the father of Tywin Lannister and Kevan Lannister, and grandfather of Cersei, Jaime, Tyrion, and Lancel[1].
            Lord Tytos raised the kennelmaster of Casterly Rock to knighthood after the latter saved him from a lioness that tried to kill him. He also granted him lands, a keep, and the kennelmaster's son was taken as a squire. Thus House Clegane was born.[2]
            Tytos presided over a period of decline for the House. He frittered away much of their fortune on poor investments and allowed himself to be mocked at court creating a perception of weakness.
            This reputation led the Lannister vassals of House Reyne of Castamere to eventually rise in rebellion. Tytos' successor, Tywin, put down the rebellion personally, extinguishing their house and re-establishing the fearsome reputation of House Lannister. His ruthlessness gave darker meaning to the common phrase "A Lannister always pays his debts" and was immortalized in the song "The Rains of Castamere".[3]
            When arriving at his father's encampment with a number of hill tribe leaders, Tyrion Lannister introduces his father to them, calling him "Tywin, son of Tytos".[4]
            At Harrenhal, Tywin recalls watching Tytos growing old to his cupbearer. Tywin believes that his father loved him and was a good man but weak. He blames Tytos for endangering their house and name.[5]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lord Tytos was called a kind but weak man. He loaned money to lords who never bothered to repay him and his vassals openly ignored his orders, mocking him in open court. This made his son Tywin mistrust laughter, and become a hard and cold man.
            Tytos's father was Gerold the Golden, who appears in the Tales of Dunk and Egg prequel novellas set 90 years before the events of the main series. Gerold had at least four sons: the twins Tywald and Tion, then Tytos, then Jason. As a third son, Tytos was not initially expected to rule, but both of his older brothers died without issue while their father was still alive, meaning that Tytos directly succeeded Gerold. Tywald died in the same battle against an outlaw lord in which King Maekar Targaryen died. He had been betrothed to Ellyn Reyne, so to maintain the alliance she was married to Tion. For a time Ellyn dominated Casterly Rock, but their marriage proved childless, and Tion later died in the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion. Gerold rid the castle of Ellyn by marrying her off to old lord Walderran Tarbeck - but she then proceeded to have numerous children by him. Tytos himself had married Jeyne Marbrand, and there came to be a bitter rivalry between the two women. Ellyn Tarbeck named her children after dead Lannister relatives, to spite them. Tytos and Jeyne had four sons: Tywin, Kevan, Tygett, and Gerion, as well as one daughter, Genna. Jeyne died only one month after giving birth to Gerion. Jason, meanwhile, was married off to Marla Prester, by whom he had five children, including Stafford and Joanna. Tywin would later marry Joanna, his own first cousin, and she bore him Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion.
            Tytos's daughter Genna states that growing up as a younger son made Tytos eager to please those around him, particularly men who were older than him. Tytos was even eager for the acceptance of older men who were his own vassals, or minor vassals of other Houses. Tytos agreed to marry Genna to Walder Frey's son Emmon, who was his second son and thus not even his heir, simply to please Lord Frey. Despite being only ten years old, Tywin was the only one who spoke out against this, pointing out how drastically uneven the match was. Even if Walder had offered his eldest son and heir in marriage, it would still have been marrying beneath Genna's station, as the Freys were only vassals of House Tully, not another Great House like the Lannisters. Years later when Tywin came to rule House Lannister, he became insulted at the prospect of Cersei settling for anything less than a royal marriage.
            According to Kevan, Lord Tytos allowed his mistress - a woman scarcely one step above a whore - to move into their castle after his wife's death, act as if she was mistress of the Rock, demanded and wore his late wife's jewels, and even spoke for Tytos when he was sick. She grew so influential that it was said in Lannisport that any man who wished for his petition to be heard should kneel before her, for Tytos's ears were between her legs. After Tytos died of a heart attack while climbing stairs to see her, Tywin sent her naked and penniless out the front gate. For further humiliation, she was forced to walk naked through the streets of Lannisport for two weeks, and to confess to every man she met that she was a thief and a whore. Although no man laid a hand on her during this humiliation (as Tywin had threatened to punish any who physically harmed her), that was the end of her power.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tytos_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascTytosLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Tyrion Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.9.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Tyrion Lannister is the youngest child of Lord Tywin Lannister and younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister. A dwarf, he uses his wit and intellect to overcome the prejudice he faces.
            His abduction by Catelyn Stark for a crime he did not commit serves as one of the catalysts of the War of the Five Kings. After escaping his captors, Tyrion is appointed by his father as acting Hand of the King to Joffrey Baratheon and successfully defends King's Landing against Stannis Baratheon at the Battle of the Blackwater, after which he is stripped of his power, demoted to Master of Coin and eventually framed for Joffrey's murder. After his champion, Oberyn Martell, dies in Tyrion's trial by combat, Tyrion flees to Essos with help from Jaime and Varys after murdering his father.
            In the east, he is captured by Jorah Mormont and taken to Daenerys Targaryen in Meereen, whom Varys had intended for Tyrion to meet anyway. Daenerys decides to enlist his help in reclaiming the Iron Throne. For his loyalty and service, Tyrion is named as Hand of the Queen to Daenerys before they set sail for Westeros with her new army and allies, ready to advise her when they reach her ancestral home of Dragonstone, where he acts as her strategist during her invasion of Westeros.
            Tyrion Lannister is the youngest son of Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister. Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of the realm. He is the younger brother of Jaime and Cersei Lannister. His mother Joanna Lannister died giving birth to him. His father and sister blame Tyrion for the death.[2][3]
            He is a dwarf, causing him problems and persecution. His size has led him to being referred to derisively by various names, such as "The Imp" and "The Halfman". This is mitigated by his intellect and his family's wealth and power. Had an infant with dwarfism like Tyrion been born a commoner, he'd have simply been left out in the woods to die. However, Tyrion was born into a powerful noble House, and was therefore spared. Even though his father doesn't think much of him, he has had the benefits of being raised with wealth and education, and is expected to lead his life as a credit to the Lannister name.[4] He is committed to the good of both his House and, since Cersei married King Robert Baratheon, his family's continued hold on the throne.[2]
            When Tyrion was 16, he met a wheelwright's daughter named Tysha on the road, apparently the victim of an attempted rape. While his brother Jaime ran off the attackers, Tyrion helped Tysha recover from the ordeal, and they became lovers. They found a drunken, wandering septon willing to marry them and briefly, they lived as husband and wife. That is, until Lord Tywin learned what had happened. Jaime confessed that he organized the incident to make his brother happy, and Tysha was actually a prostitute. As a lesson, Tywin gave Tysha to his guards, paying her a silver coin for each man and forcing Tyrion to watch. By the end, there were so many silver coins that they were running out of her hands onto the ground. Tyrion has reciprocated Tywin's hatred ever since.[5]
            His two siblings have had positions of respect and responsibility since their teens. When Tyrion turned sixteen (the age of manhood), Tywin Lannister put Tyrion in charge of the drains and cisterns at Casterly Rock. Tyrion brags that the "[sewage] never flowed [smoother] to the sea."[6]
            Tyrion once encountered Lord Gregor Forrester at the Tourney in Lannisport. While they once spoke briefly, Tyrion found Gregor very honorable, even mentioning it to Gregor's daughter Mira years later.
            Tyrion spends a lot of time at court in King's Landing to avoid his father. He gets on well with Jaime and his niece Myrcella and nephew Tommen, but has a colder relationship with Cersei and his sadistic nephew Joffrey.[7] He has a fondness for prostitutes and drink, but is also intelligent, cunning, and educated. He also is a kind man who would protect the innocent, claiming that he loves broken things.
            Tyrion accompanies King Robert Baratheon's party to Winterfell, but after weeks on the road, he leaves the party and rides ahead to seek the pleasures of the winter town's brothels, where he makes the acquaintance of Ros.[8] He gives the prostitute a Lannister lion necklace to thank her for their time together.[9] Jaime convinces him to join the family for dinner. Tyrion dawdles outside the feast hall, reluctant to make nice with the Starks and his own family, and as a result meets Jon Snow, Lord Eddard Stark's bastard son. He realizes that Jon is something of a kindred spirit: "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes," he explains.[8]
            When Tyrion's nephew, Prince Joffrey Baratheon, refuses to pay his respects to Lord and Lady Stark after Bran's fall, Tyrion slaps him three times until he acquiesces. He then breakfasts with his family, where he reveals that he wants to go and visit the Wall - to see it and piss off of it, he says, to the laughter of Tommen and Myrcella, before returning to King's Landing. He takes an interest in Bran's fall and how it happened, noting carefully his brother and sister's reactions to the news that Bran is likely to live.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascTyrionLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Tywin Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.10.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lord Tywin Lannister was the head of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, Hand of the King for three different kings, and Protector of the Realm. He was the father of Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion Lannister, and sole grandfather of the incest-born Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen Baratheon.
            Tywin is the Lord of House Lannister, the Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, and the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Lannister rule the region from their seat of Casterly Rock and Tywin also holds the title Lord of Casterly Rock. He is also the Warden of the West. He is a widower with three children, Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion.[2]​ Casterly Rock, the Lannisters' ancestral seat of power, is located over a group of highly productive goldmines, which have provided the Lannisters with immense wealth over the years and led to the speculation that Tywin "shits gold."
            Tywin is the beloved son of Tytos Lannister. His father presided over a period of decline for the house, frittering away much of their fortune on poor investments and allowing himself to be mocked at court, creating a perception of weakness. Their vassals House Reyne of Castamere rebelled against Lord Tytos, and Tywin put down the rebellion personally, extinguishing their house and re-establishing the fearsome reputation of House Lannister. His ruthless destruction of House Reyne was immortalized in the song "The Rains of Castamere" and gave darker meaning to the common phrase "A Lannister always pays his debts," which originally referred solely to the Lannisters' vast fortune.[3]
            Tywin married his cousin Joanna Lannister and their first children were the fraternal twins Cersei and Jaime. She died after giving birth to Tyrion, which Tywin has blamed his son for ever since.[4][5] When Jaime was diagnosed with a learning difficulty by a Maester who predicted that he would never read, Tywin sat with his son for four hours a day until he overcame his problems with transposing letters in his mind, much to Jaime's resentment.[6] Tywin despises and hates his younger son, seeing him as misshapen and perverse. When Tyrion was very young, Jaime set him up with a whore. Jaime posed her as a common girl in distress that they rescued from bandits. Jaime chased the bandits off while Tyrion comforted the girl. They married, but when Tywin found out he was furious and made Jaime reveal the truth. Tywin paid her for every one of his guards to have sex with her and forced Tyrion to watch. Tyrion's hatred of Tywin has been reciprocated since.[7] Nevertheless, all of Tywin's children are in awe of him and heed his counsel.[8] He also took part in the War of the Ninepenny Kings.
            A highly capable administrator, Tywin served as Hand of the King to Aerys II Targaryen for twenty years until the Mad King, driven by envy and distrust, rejected Tywin's proposal to marry his daughter Cersei to Prince Rhaegar and made his son Jaime a member of the Kingsguard. As members of the Kingsguard are forbidden to marry, Aerys had effectively robbed Tywin of his heir, which Tywin perceived as a great insult and resigned.[8][9][10] During Robert's Rebellion Tywin remained neutral, answering neither the summons of the King nor the calls from the rebels, until the Battle of the Trident, after which it became clear that the rebels would win. Tywin marched with the full power of Casterly Rock to the capital, feigning that he had come to defend it from the rebellion. Aerys' advisors urged the King not to trust Tywin, even Jaime Lannister, who knew his father would never back the losing side in a war.[11]
            Nevertheless, on Pycelle's advice, the gates were opened to the Lannister army. Tywin ordered the city to be taken and the royal family eliminated in a quick and efficient manner; as a result the city was sacked and the royal family massacred by Ser Gregor Clegane. Upon seeing Tywin's betrayal, Aerys ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin's head and instructed his royal pyromancer to set King's Landing ablaze. Jaime responded by personally stabbing the Mad King in the back. When Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark reached the Red Keep, Tywin presented the bodies of the royal family as proof of his allegiance. After the rebellion, Robert Baratheon took the throne and married Tywin's daughter Cersei to cement the alliance between their houses.[12]
            Cersei gave birth to three children: Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen Baratheon. Unbeknownst to Tywin, all three children are the product of her incestuous relationship with Jaime.[13] This was discovered by both Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark, albeit independently, and meant that Joffrey—the oldest of the Baratheon children and the heir apparent to the Iron Throne—had no actual claim to the throne. Tywin is close to his younger brother, Kevan, who is his chief advisor. Kevan's son Lancel was King Robert's squire; many secretly believe Lancel gave Robert too much wine during his fatal hunt on Cersei's orders.[14]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascTywinLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Tyland Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.11.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Tyland Lannister was a member of House Lannister and a member of the small council during the Dance of the Dragons.
            Ser Tyland Lannister was a member of the small council in the final days of the reign of King Viserys I Targaryen. After his death, he was present in the secret meeting in which Queen Alicent Hightower, the newly widow of King Viserys, and Ser Criston Cole, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, forced the council to declare for Aegon II Targaryen instead of Viserys's designated heir, Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, and witnessed the death of Lord Lyman Beesbury - who remained staunchly loyal to the princess.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there's no mention of Ser Tyland Lannister. He does appear in The Princess and the Queen and The Rogue Prince novellas and is mentioned as well in The World of Ice and Fire. Tyland was the younger twin brother of Lord Jason Lannister, the Lord of Casterly Rock, and the Master of Ships for King Viserys I. As such, Tyland is apparently not a direct ancestor of Tywin Lannister and his children: they seem to descend from his brother Jason. In their youth, both brothers unsuccessfully vied for Rhaenyra's hand in marriage.
            After the death of King Viserys, Ser Tyland supported crowning Aegon II, citing that many of the lords that had sworn to defend Rhaenyra's claim were long dead after twenty four years and that he himself hadn't sworn any oaths - being a child at the time.
            After the murder of Lyman Beesbury, Master of Coin, Ser Tyland was named the new Master of Coin and quickly moved to secure the royal treasury for the greens and divided it into four parts - one entrusted to the Iron Bank of Braavos for safekeeping, the second sent to Casterly Rock, the third to Oldtown and the remaining fourth kept by the greens for bribes, gifts and hiring sellswords.
            Unlike the other members of the Green Small Council that Rhaenyra captured when King's Landing fell to her, Tyland wasn't executed - instead he was handed over to the torturers, to try to get him to reveal where all the gold from the old royal treasury was hidden. He was blinded and mutilated but survived. His mind still intact, he actually lived to play a role during later events in the Dance, being sent to the Free Cities to hire sellswords for Aegon II. After the war ended and Rhaenyra's son Aegon III became king, Tyland was made Hand of the King and defied expectations of being weak. He eventually died of Winter Fever.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tyland_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascTylandLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Stafford Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.12.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Stafford Lannister commanded the new House Lannister army that was raised in the Westerlands to replace Jaime Lannister's army which was destroyed in the Battle of the Whispering Wood. Stafford's army was defeated during the Battle of Oxcross, in which Stafford himself was killed.[1]
            Ser Stafford is the brother of Joanna Lannister, the late wife of Lord Tywin Lannister, which makes him the maternal uncle of Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion Lannister. He is also a cousin of Lord Tywin and his brother Ser Kevan Lannister.
            Robb Stark's army sneaks through the mountains bordering the Westerlands, and ambushes Stafford's army at night in their own camp at Oxcross. Stafford's army of raw recruits is massacred, and Stafford himself is killed. After the Lannister defeat at the Battle of Oxcross, King Joffrey Baratheon torments Sansa Stark before the royal court; Ser Lancel Lannister reports that Robb Stark employed sorcery and wolves to massacre the Lannister army and that after the battle, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Stafford Lannister is the brother of Joanna Lannister. He and his sister were the children of Lord Tytos Lannister's younger brother. Thus, both Joanna and Stafford were first cousins of Tywin and the main branch of the family.
            In his youth, Stafford and two more Lannisters were captured by Lady Tarbeck in retaliation for the imprisonment of her lord husband by Tytos Lannister. She threatened to kill the captives if her husband would be harmed. Tywin suggested his father to send Lord Tarbeck back to his wife in three pieces, but the soft-hearted Tytos complied and returned Tarbeck unharmed in exchange for the three Lannisters.
            Stafford dies in the Battle of Oxcross, killed by Lord Rickard Karstark. Both Jaime Lannister and Brynden Tully consider him a poor commander as he didn't scout the area believing Robb Stark was far away. Robb Stark had been led by Grey Wind along a goat path and had thus bypasses fortified positions in order to attack undetected.
            The Lannister survivors regrouped at Lannisport under Ser Daven Lannister, Stafford's son and widely considered to be a more intelligent commander than his father.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Stafford_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascStaffordLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Rorge</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.13.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Rorge was a criminal, forcibly recruited into the Night's Watch.
            Rorge is a criminal, forcibly recruited, along with Jaqen H'ghar and Biter, into the Night's Watch by Yoren during his visit to King's Landing. He was accompanying the rest of Yoren's new recruits northwards to the Wall before taken prisoner and inducted into the Lannister army.
            When looking for fresh recruits for the Night's Watch, Yoren was given permission by Lord Eddard Stark, Hand of the King to go through the dungeons and take any criminals who would swear to take the black. He chose murderer Rorge as a potential candidate, as well as two other criminals Jaqen H'ghar and Biter from the black cells, where the worst criminals are kept.
            Rorge is in the party led by Yoren that leaves King's Landing for the Wall, along with Hot Pie, Lommy Greenhands, Gendry, and Arya Stark who is being smuggled out to be returned to Winterfell. Because Yoren is traveling so far with so few men, the worst three criminals are kept in a locked barred cell on the back of a wagon.[1]
            Rorge is kept inside a cage alongside Biter and Jaqen H'ghar for their trip to the Wall, because they are dangerous prisoners from the city's dungeons. When Jaqen asks "Arry" for water, Rorge demands beer and insults Arya, who says that he should have asked nicely and hits Rorge's hand with a stick. He recoils and then tries to grab Arya through the cage. Biter moves up behind Rorge and hisses as Rorge threatens Arya again.[2]
            The group is resting in a barn when they are roused to arms by Yoren and told they are being attacked. As they rush outside one man trips and drops his torch, setting a fire near the prisoner wagon. They are met by Ser Amory Lorch and a force of men loyal to House Lannister. Lorch points out the Gold Cloaks with him and says that they have come for Gendry, a royal bastard. Lorch orders Yoren and the recruits to drop their weapons. Yoren remains defiant and Lorch orders him shot.[3]
            Seeing their leader killed, Gendry and many of the other recruits join the fight. Arya is distracted by Jaqen calling for help as the flames lick the bars of the cage. She hands him an axe before rushing to join the fray. They use it to escape the wagon. Gendry is overwhelmed and knocked down. As Arya runs round a corner she is knocked over and taken prisoner along with the other survivors.[3]
            Rorge, Biter and Jaqen are inducted into the Lannister army. They serve at Harrenhal, where their former fellow recruits are also taken as captives. Arya approaches Rorge and Biter, she is looking for Jaqen. Rorge repeats his earlier threats and shows no acknowledgement of her saving his life, calling her Yoren's little cunt. They then leave Harrenhal.[4]
            Arya and The Hound come across a homestead recently burned and pillaged by Rorge and Biter. After granting a mortally wounded peasant a merciful death, The Hound is suddenly ambushed from behind by Biter and bitten. The Hound overpowers Biter and kills him by snapping his neck. Rorge appears, and recognizes The Hound. He tells them about Joffrey's death, and says there is a price on Sandor's head for killing Lannister soldiers. The Hound is unimpressed, but Arya remembers Rorge as the prisoner of the Night's Watch who threatened to "fuck her bloody" with a stick. Sandor asks if he's on her list, and she replies that he can't be because she doesn't know his name. The Hound asks him; as soon as Rorge replies, Arya swiftly kills him with a quick thrust of Needle to the heart.[5]
            Fans have speculated that the three prisoners in Yoren's wagon in the final episode of the first season of the series were meant to be Rorge, Biter and (in a cloak with his face hidden) Jaqen H'ghar. However, these three roles were played by extras, with full-time actors for the roles not hired until filming of Season 2 was underway.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Rorge is described as thick, short, and very hairy. He was a petty thug in King's Landing who at some time had lost his nose. To hide his missing nose, he wears a helm with a nose guard whenever he can. According to semi-canon source, he ran a dog and bear-fighting pit in the city and had his protege Biter fight in the pit for money. The pit was shut down and both were arrested and cast into the cells of the Red Keep shortly before Yoren found them and forcibly recruited them into the Watch.
            Rorge is also a prolific raper, and his constant threats to shove a stick up the ass of anyone he dislikes are not merely rhetoric. Rorge committed rape so many times that he was eventually caught by the City Watch and castrated, but undeterred, Rorge continued to rape or sodomize people with sticks and other objects. His real pleasure wasn't in the actual sex act, but in sadistically inflicting pain and death on others.
            When Arya Stark encountered Rorge in Harrenhal, his reaction was the same as in the TV series. Arya reminded him that she saved him, and the ingrate thug promised to rape her once more for that. Arya's mentioning of Jaqen H'ghar's name seemed to scare him, though.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rorge</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascRorge</string></dict>

            Rennick is a soldier on sentry duty at the camp of the Lannister forces commanded by Ser Stafford Lannister on their way to reinforce Tywin Lannister's army in the Riverlands.
            He is on duty with a Lannister guardsman at the perimeter of Stafford Lannister's camp prior to the Battle of Oxcross. They debate on who is the greatest swordsman in the Seven Kingdoms. He argues against Ser Gregor Clegane who is big rather than skilled, and Ser Loras Tyrell who is just too pretty, though he does give credit to "our man Jaime, if he ever gets out".
            They both hear that the horses are spooked, but they aren't too concerned. Then he hears something and walks out into the darkness. The other guardsman follows hesitantly. When Rennick starts to draw his sword the man thinks they are being attacked, but Rennick merely passes gas and starts laughing at him.
            As Rennick stops to urinate, the guardsman sees that the horses are getting more upset not less, but Rennick is not paying attention until the man screams his name. Rennick looks up just in time to see the direwolf Grey Wind leaping out of the darkness at him. In the subsequent attack by the Stark army the camp is taken completely by surprise and the Lannister army is annihilated.
            The next morning the camera pans across the battlefield, showing Rennick's body lying on the ground. He has lost part of his face.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Rennick</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascRennick</string></dict>

            Reginald Lannister is a distant relative of the Lannisters, belonging to a cadet branch of House Lannister established on the city of Lannisport. Reginald Lannister fights for Lord Tywin in the War of the Five Kings. However, Tywin has made him an officer in the Westerlands army solely due to his name, and actually views him with contempt. He is married and his wife remains in the family seat of Lannisport.
            Reginald is present at a war council held by Lord Tywin inside Harrenhal. Reginald suggests that the Starks have stretched their lines too thin and will struggle to sustain their army with winter imminent. Tywin rejects this notion, saying that the Starks are more capable than they are of coping with cold. The council continues and Tywin chastises his bannermen for waiting for Robb Stark to fail and that he won't unless they make him. He asks how they will stop Robb and Reginald ignores the question to say that they have been working through the night and would benefit from sleep. Tywin says that he believes Reginald would and that because they are cousins he might let Reginald wake from his sleep. He orders Reginald to return to his wife in Lannisport before he decides to send her his head. He adds that Reginald is only an officer because of his birth and otherwise would be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character by the name of Reginald Lannister. Among Lord Tywin's bannermen at Harrenhal there's actually no member of either the mainline House Lannister or the cadet branch.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Reginald_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascReginaldLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Polliver</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.16.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Polliver was a man-at-arms in service of House Lannister during the War of the Five Kings.
            Polliver is a Lannister man-at-arms under the command of Ser Amory Lorch. He accompanies Lorch in the attack on Yoren and his Night's Watch recruits. He knocks Arya Stark over when she runs to join the fight and takes Needle from her, and amused, says that he will pick his teeth with it. When the Lannister forces are victorious, Amory says that they will take the survivors back to Harrenhal.
            As they are rounding up the survivors, Polliver approaches the injured boy Lommy, who has been shot with an arrow in his leg and says Polliver needs to carry him. Polliver seemingly obliges and offers a hand, but instead stabs the boy in the neck with Needle. Coughing up blood, Lommy chokes to death as Polliver returns to his fellow men-at-arms and mocks Lommy's request. Arya fools Lorch and his men into believing that Lommy was their target; the Royal bastard Gendry. Gendry is actually among the captives.[1]
            Lorch and his men deliver the prisoners to Ser Gregor Clegane at Harrenhal. Ser Gregor oversees the torture of the captives, killing several of them. After Arya sees Polliver beating up an old woman prisoner for asking him for a crust of bread, Arya adds Polliver's name to her nightly recitation of her enemies. Gendry is selected to be tortured while Polliver stands guard. Lord Tywin Lannister arrives during the torture and asks Gregor what is going on. Gregor says that they were not expecting Tywin for another day. Tywin asks why the prisoners are not in their cells. Gregor says that their cells are overflowing. Polliver interjects that the prisoners will not be there long. Tywin asks if they are so well manned that they can afford to discard able and skilled prisoners. Polliver catches Arya looking at Needle in his sword belt and orders her to kneel, calling her boy. Tywin immediately realizes that she is a girl and calls Polliver an idiot. He asks why she has dressed as a boy and she says that it was safer to travel. He says that she is smart and orders the prisoners be put to work. He says that Arya will be his new cupbearer.[2]
            Polliver and four other kingsmen, including Lowell, are in a tavern, robbing the innkeeper of his supplies while they prepare to rape his daughter. The Hound and Arya Stark arrive. Polliver recognizes the Hound, but not Arya, and greets him warmly by having the innkeeper serve them ale. Polliver wonders what brings the Hound so far North, and the Hound wonders the same of him. Polliver says he is keeping the king's peace, but the Hound finds it needless as the war is over, and Polliver acknowledges Stannis's defeat at the Blackwater and Robb Stark's defeat at the Twins. Polliver states his regret being "stuck with" Gregor Clegane, calling it torture and saying that he feels like a carpenter making chairs, and it drains the fun right out of it, but that he shouldn't have mentioned that to Arya. The Hound says she is decent company, and Polliver tries to convince him to join them in raping, robbing and pillaging; they have free reign to do as they wish, since they are wearing the King's colors and no one is standing in his way as the war is over. Sandor's blunt response is "fuck the King". Offended, Polliver mentions the hearsay about the Hound running from the Battle of the Blackwater and how he originally didn't believe it. The Hound mocks the suggestion and demands a chicken.
            Polliver asks if he has money to pay for the chicken, in which the Hound asks if Polliver paid for it. Polliver chuckles and says no, but that they are the king's men, and again asks if he has money. The Hound says no but still demands the chicken. Polliver presents him a deal: one of their chickens in exchange for raping Arya, mentioning that his friend Lowell "likes them a bit broken in." The Hound calls him a "talker", and that "talkers make him thirsty", and takes Polliver's drink and chugs it down. He says that they also make him hungry, and now demands two chickens.
            At a meeting of the Small Council, Varys informs the other members that The Hound has slaughtered five Lannister soldiers in the Riverlands.[4]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Polliver is a Lannister man-at-arms but he is under the command of Ser Gregor Clegane instead of Ser Amory Lorch. In the books it is Lorch who leads the attack on Yoren's recruits but Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie, the little girl named Weasel and Lommy escape. They are captured later by Clegane's men and Lommy is killed by Rafford (aka Raff the Sweetling), rather than Polliver. Nevertheless it is Polliver that takes Needle.
            Arya and the Hound encounter Polliver, accompanied by the Tickler and a Sarsfield squire, at the Inn at the Crossroads in A Storm of Swords. It is the Hound and not Arya who kills Polliver in the ensuing brawl. Instead, Arya kills the Tickler, who in the novels was never targeted by Jaqen H'ghar.
            Because Polliver was combined with Raff in the TV series, however, Arya kills Polliver in the TV series the same way that she later kills Raff in the books: quoting back the same taunts he made to Lommy before he killed the boy, then stabbing Polliver/Raff through the throat in the same way that he killed Lommy.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Polliver</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascPolliver</string></dict>
        <key>Orson Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.17.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>​Orson Lannister ​was a member of House Lannister and a distant cousin to Tyrion, Jaime, and Cersei Lannister.
            Orson was born into House Lannister. When he was a baby, a wet nurse dropped him on his head, which apparently caused brain damage and left him simpleminded for all of his life. His relatives would regularly laugh at him due to his handicap, among them his cousins Tyrion and Jaime Lannister. Tyrion admits that he only laughed at Orson because for a moment he could be like everyone else, since he too was an outcast due to being a dwarf.
            He would regularly smash beetles with a ​rock in the gardens, leading Tyrion to ask him why, to which Orson only replied unintelligibly. Tyrion then observed Orson every day smashing the beetles, convinced that Orson must have been doing it for a reason. Since Tyrion considered himself to be the smartest person he knew, he thought he could discover the reason for his cousin's behavior. Finding the answer eventually became an obsession to Tyrion: it got to the point where Tyrion could not sleep, having nightmares about Orson's "relentless beetle slaughter". Tyrion attempted to stop Orson from smashing any more beetles, but since Orson was twice Tyrion's size, he simply pushed Tyrion away and continued smashing.
            Orson was eventually kicked in the chest by a mule and died, leaving the question of why he was smashing all the beetles unsolved.[1]
            While Tyrion is waiting in his prison cell for the Trial by combat that will decide his fate, he reminisces with Jaime about cousin Orson. Tyrion recalls (at length) Orson's slaughter of beetles, explaining that it always troubled him that he couldn't discern why Orson was engaging in such wanton and seemingly random destruction. Similarly, Tyrion is wondered why he has been unjustly targeted and may soon die for a crime he did not commit. Tyrion ponders this as he picks up a beetle he found in his cell, but unlike Orson, puts it back down and leaves it unharmed.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no such character nor, so far, any parallel to him. At some point however, Tyrion jokingly mentions that his father kept some of his "drooling cousins" locked in the bowels of Casterly Rock to keep them from shaming the family.
            The only book character by that name is Orson Stone, a sellsword and member of the Windblown mercenary company. He has nothing to do with the Lannisters, is not feeble-minded, and has no habit of crushing beetles.
            Tyrion's prolonged discussion of Orson lasts nearly four minutes in "The Mountain and the Viper". The writers explained in the Inside-the-Episode featurette that their intention was that faced with his probable death, Tyrion's mind is wandering to question why seemingly random acts of brutality happen in the world, and that he saw Orson smashing beetles as a sort of microcosm of this question. The analogy is that if Orson was an almighty force inflicting death and destruction on insects, if there is a higher power inflicting death and destruction on human beings - whatever god, gods, "nature", or "fate" this power may be - Tyrion would at least feel better knowing there was some underlying reason that went into causing such brutality. He also wouldn't be particularly upset if there are no higher powers, and bad things truly happen at random. But Tyrion felt that Orson wasn't acting randomly, some sort of decision-making process was going into his actions, though he could not discern it: what frightens Tyrion is that some unknown, but still reasoning thing or cosmic powers are intentionally directing people towards death and destruction, yet all of our attempts to comprehend why they are doing this (even a simple reason like "hate") are in vain.
            The scene is very similar to a famous one from the Stanley Kubrick film Paths of Glory, in which a condemned man sees a cockroach and laments "Tomorrow morning we'll be dead and it'll be alive. It will have more contact with my wife and child than I will. I'll be nothing, and it'll be alive." His fellow prisoner then crushes the cockroach and says, "Now you've got the edge on him." While Benioff and Weiss didn't explicitly state that they were recalling this film, shortly afterwards they mentioned in an interview about the battle scene for the very next episode that they and the production team are fans of Paths of Glory and used it as a visual reference for certain war scenes - so the similarity is probably not coincidental.[2]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Orson_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascOrsonLannister</string></dict>

        <key>Martyn Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.19.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Martyn Lannister along with his brother Willem, was a squire in the Lannister army. Both are younger sons of Kevan Lannister, and younger brothers of Ser Lancel Lannister.
            Martyn, along with his brother Willem, is captured by the forces of House Tully led by Edmure Tully following the Battle of Stone Mill. He is taken hostage and placed in a cell at Riverrun, the seat of the Tullys.
            After Robb Stark visits Riverrun to attend the funerals of Lord Hoster Tully, Martyn and Willem are visited in their cell by Queen Talisa Stark, who tends to Martyn's wounded hand while Willem looks in silence. Martyn asks if its true that Robb can turn into a wolf at night and devours the flesh of his enemies.[1]
            Martyn and Willem are murdered inside their cells by Lord Rickard Karstark as vengeance for Jaime Lannister's killing of his son, Torrhen Karstark. Their bodies are presented to Robb, and as Rickard defends his actions as them being kin to Jaime, Robb furiously condemns this as saying they were innocent boys.[2]
            Martyn is played by Dean-Charles Chapman, who would go on to be cast as Tommen Baratheon in the fourth season of the television series.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Martyn and Willem are the twin sons of Ser Kevan Lannister, and younger brothers of Lancel Lannister. Martyn is captured at the Battle of Oxcross. It is not Martyn but his cousin Tion Frey who is killed with Willem by Rickard Karstark. After Willem and Tion's death, Robb ordered to triple the guard on Martyn for his protection, and later exchanged him for a northman prisoner (Robett Glover). Martyn is not mentioned in the books afterwards.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Martyn_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascMartynLannister</string></dict>

            Loren Lannister was the last of the Lannister Kings of the Rock. When Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros, King Loren joined forces with Mern IX, the King of the Reach, to face Aegon in battle.
            However, Aegon unleashed his three dragons, Vhagar, Meraxes and Balerion the Black Dread against the combined might of the Kingdoms of the Reach and the Rock. Four thousand men perished, consumed in a "field of fire," including King Mern. Seeing he had no chance of victory, King Loren bent the knee to Aegon and gave up his crown. He was named Lord Paramount of the Westerlands and Warden of the West.[1][2][3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Loren's story is the same.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Loren_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascLorenLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Lorimer</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.21.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Lorimer was a knight for whom Podrick Payne squired prior to entering into the service of Tyrion Lannister.
            Ser Lorimer was a lesser knight fighting for House Lannister during the War of the Five Kings, with Podrick Payne, member of a lesser branch of House Payne, serving as his squire. One night Lorimer got drunk and stole a ham, which he shared with Podrick. Lorimer was caught and the two were sentenced to be hanged. Lorimer was thus executed, while Podrick was pardoned by Lord Tywin Lannister because of his family name.[1]
            Podrick recounts his history with Lorimer to Brienne of Tarth. Podrick sympathetically says that Lorimer wasn't really a thief, he was just very hungry and drunk and wasn't thinking about what he was doing - clearly saddened that he ended up being executed for it.[1]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lorimer's story is quite similar. He's nicknamed "Lorimer the Belly" for being fat. He was a hedge knight serving Lord Leo Lefford. Podrick attached himself to him after his previous master, his kinsman Ser Cedric Payne, died fighting in the Riverlands. Lorimer was hanged as a thief after being found to have stolen a ham.
            Lorimer and Podrick stole and ate the ham while in camp waiting for the Battle of the Green Fork, in the first novel. While this happened in Season 1 of the TV series, Podrick's introduction was pushed back to the beginning of Season 2. Therefore when he relates this story in Season 5's "High Sparrow", Podrick is explaining what he was doing "off-screen" in Season 1.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lorimer</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascLorimer</string></dict>
        <key>Lyman Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.22.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Lyman Lannister is a third cousin to the main branch of House Lannister.
            Lyman participated in and was wounded at the Tourney at Lannisport. After falling off of his horse and hitting his head, he needed Milk of the poppy for weeks to keep him from screaming. He became addicted to milk of the poppy, and continued to use it for many years afterward, using all of his money to get more. He shakes often as a result of this overuse.
            Having allied himself with Lord Andros, a merchant lord, to deal ironwood. Lyman shared his secrets, including his injury at Lannisport and addiction, as well as coin with the other man. Andros had previously come into conflict with Tyrion Lannister, the Hand of the King, in regard to his ironwood contract with the king. After Tyrion was arrested for the murder of Joffrey Baratheon, however, Andros sought out Lyman and brought him into his business dealings.
            Lyman attends Tommen's coronation feast. He notices Lord Garibald Tarwick, who folds his arms and turns his back to Lyman, ignoring him. After speaking with Lord Rickard Morgryn, Mira Forrester learns that Lyman is Andros' new business partner after Morgryn and Andros disassociated. Mira goes to speak to Lyman, who is startled that someone approached him so boldy and they introduce themselves to each other. Before Mira can convince Lyman to share information with her, Andros interrupts and informs him that he was talking to Mira Forrester, and yells at Mira.
            Mira and Lord Tarwick discuss the events, and states that his concern was Lyman. When asked why, he answers that the story isn't fit for a maiden's ears. Mira manages to convince Lord Tarwick to tell about Lyman in exchange for telling him about Sera's family. He explains to her his injury at Lannisport and his addiction to milk of the poppy, and that he learned the story from Andros.
            During their conversation Lyman and Andros were also talking. When Mira comes over to speak to Lyman, who attempts to brush her off, knowing of what she means to do. However, once Mira brings up his injury and explains the details, and that Andros spilled that secret. Lyman then tells Mira of Andros' plan to hire sellswords for Lord Ludd Whitehill to march against Ironrath. Lyman notices Andros, throws his goblet on the ground and confronts him. In the confrontation, he calls him out on his lies and exclaims that he is a liar Lyman should have never trusted, that Mira told him everything. Lyman exits the feast, leaving Andros to notice Mira and confront him.[1]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Lyman_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascLymanLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Biter</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.23.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Biter was a menacing criminal forcibly recruited into the Night's Watch.
            Biter is a mute criminal from King's Landing with filed teeth. Along with Rorge and Jaqen H'ghar, he was fished out of the dungeons by Yoren and forcibly recruited into the Night's Watch. He was accompanying the rest of Yoren's new recruits northwards to the Wall before taken prisoner and inducted into the Lannister army.
            When looking for fresh recruits for the Night's Watch, Yoren was given permission by Lord Eddard Stark, Hand of the King to go through the dungeons and take any criminals who would swear to take the black. He chose murderer Biter as a potential candidate, as well as two other criminals Jaqen H'ghar and Rorge from the black cells, where the worst criminals are kept.
            Biter is in the party led by Yoren that leaves King's Landing for the Wall, along with Hot Pie, Lommy Greenhands, Gendry, and Arya Stark who is being smuggled out to be returned to Winterfell. Because Yoren is traveling so far with so few men, the worst three criminals are kept in a locked barred cell on the back of a wagon.[1]
            Biter, alongside Rorge and Jaqen H'ghar are kept inside a cage for their trip to the Wall. When Jaqen asks "Arry" (actually Arya Stark) for water, Rorge demands beer and insults Arya, who says that he should have asked nicely and hits Rorge's hand with a stick. He recoils and then tries to grab Arya through the cage. Biter moves up behind Rorge and hisses as Rorge threatens Arya again.[2]
            The group is resting in a barn when they are roused to arms by Yoren and told they are being attacked. As they rush outside one man trips and drops his torch, setting a fire near the prisoner wagon. They are met by Ser Amory Lorch and a force of men loyal to House Lannister. Lorch points out the Gold Cloaks with him and says that they have come for Gendry, a royal bastard. Lorch orders Yoren and the recruits to drop their weapons. Yoren remains defiant and Lorch orders him shot.[3]
            Seeing their leader killed, Gendry and many of the other recruits join the fight. Arya is distracted by Jaqen calling for help as the flames lick the bars of the cage. She hands him an axe before rushing to join the fray. They use it to escape the wagon. Gendry is overwhelmed and knocked down. As Arya runs round a corner she is knocked over and taken prisoner along with the other survivors.[3]
            Rorge, Biter and Jaqen are inducted into the Lannister army. They serve at Harrenhal, where their former fellow recruits are also taken as captives. Arya approaches Rorge and Biter looking for Jaqen. Rorge repeats his earlier threats and shows no acknowledgement of her saving his life.[4]
            Arya and The Hound come across a homestead recently burned and pillaged by Rorge and Biter. After granting a mortally wounded peasant a merciful death, the Hound is suddenly ambushed from behind by Biter who sinks his teeth into his flesh. The Hound quickly overpowers Biter and snaps his neck, killing him. Rorge then attempts to accost them before being recognized and slain by Arya.[5]
            Later, the bite wound inflicted by Biter begins to fester due to the Hound's fear of cauterizing it with fire.[6]
            Fans have speculated that the three prisoners in Yoren's wagon in the final episode of the first season of the series were meant to be Rorge, Biter and (in a cloak with his face hidden) Jaqen H'ghar. However, these three roles were played by extras, with full-time actors for the roles not hired until filming of Season 2 was underway.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Biter is a mindless, mute thug from King's Landing, an associate of Rorge. According to semi-canon source, Rorge ran several fighting pits where dogs and bears would fight one another and also people. Biter fought in these pits and developed a reputation for savage cruelty. He has no tongue and only speaks through hisses. His teeth have been filed to points.
            Rorge and Biter helped Arya Stark and Jaqen H'ghar to free the Northern prisoners at Harrenhal. Afterwards they join the Brave Companions, the notorious sellsword company led by Vargo Hoat.
            Biter is known for his bestial savagery. He tears flesh out of his victims' bodies with his sharpened teeth. According to Rorge, Biter once chewed the breasts of a septa sometime during their pillaging.
            While Vargo Hoat becomes delirious due to his festering head injury, many of the Brave Companions leave Harrenhal, among them Rorge and Biter. They and five more form a gang that sacks Saltpans. They never encounter Arya and the Hound.
            Rorge and Biter have nothing to do with the dying man that Arya and the Hound find. He was injured by a Bolton soldier.
            Rorge's gang encounters Brienne near the Inn at the Crossroads. Brienne fights Rorge and kills him, but Biter tackles her down, overcomes her and savagely chews her face. Eventually Gendry intervenes and kills Biter by driving a spear through the back of his neck (similarly to Karl Tanner's death in the TV series), but not before Brienne's face is horribly disfigured.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Biter</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascBiter</string></dict>
        <key>Qyburn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.24.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Qyburn is an unethical former maester who was thrown out of the order for conducting illegal human experimentation. After coming into Cersei Lannister's service, he becomes Varys's replacement as Master of Whisperers on the small council. Following the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, Qyburn becomes Hand of the Queen to Cersei I, the new Queen of the Andals and the First Men.
            Qyburn is a former maester of the Citadel. He was stripped of his chain by the Archmaesters for engaging in forbidden human experimentation: it was discovered that he had been vivisecting men in his pursuit of medical knowledge. Qyburn held to the belief that the death of a few men was justifiable if it would lead to medical breakthroughs that would save the lives of many more.
            While his unethical experiments have led to him being reviled, they also made him arguably one of the most talented healers in all of Westeros.
            For unknown reasons, Qyburn ended up among the Northern and Riverlands prisoners at Harrenhal when Ser Gregor Clegane abandons the castle and has all captives put to the sword. Qyburn, however, survives the injury at his throat and awakens when the castle is taken by the Northern army. After he wakes, he identifies himself to Robb Stark while Talisa Stark tends to his wound.[1]
            After Robb leaves Harrenhal, Qyburn stays behind, serving under Lord Roose Bolton. He tends to Ser Jaime Lannister's badly infected stump, the result of Locke chopping off his right hand. During this time, Jaime notices that Qyburn is not a Maester because he isn't wearing a maester's chain of office.
            Qyburn acknowledges this, explaining that he was stripped of his chain by the Citadel and thrown out of the Order of Maesters for conducting experiments which they felt were too "bold". Qyburn initially intends to amputate part of Jaime's arm, but Jaime begs him not to, even threatening to kill him. Qyburn agrees to instead resort to removing the infected flesh, warning that the process will be painful and likely require Milk of the poppy, but Jaime, worrying that Qyburn may still amputate his arm, refuses. Qyburn straps Jaime's arm to the chair and starts the painful procedure.[2]
            Qyburn volunteers to join the party escorting Jaime back to King's Landing. Lord Bolton theorizes that the former Maester is doing so in the hopes that Tywin Lannister will force the Citadel to restore his chain, though Jaime shoots it down by sarcastically quipping that Tywin will make Qyburn Grand Maester if he grows Jaime a new hand. After leaving Harrenhal, when Qyburn checks on Jaime's healing stump, Jaime notes that Qyburn's work is far superior to that of Grand Maester Pycelle and asks why the Citadel removed his chain. Qyburn tells him that it was for performing experiments on living humans in order to learn more about their anatomy and justifies his actions by noting that he used the information he gleaned from them to save lives. Jaime briefly mocks Qyburn, who shoots back at Jaime for the countless lives he's taken, though Jaime notes that he saved the population of King's Landing from the Mad King. When Jaime then asks Qyburn about Brienne, he states that her father offered Locke a fair ransom of three hundred Gold Dragons, which Locke refused to accept due to a previous lie of Jaime's that Brienne came from a wealthier family than she really did. Qyburn tells Jaime that she will most likely serve as entertainment for Locke and his men that night, and be killed thereafter. Qyburn then accompanies Jaime and Steelshanks to Harrenhal when Jaime blackmails Steelshanks into helping him rescue Brienne.[3]
            Qyburn is still with Jaime and Brienne when they finally reach King's Landing. As they enter the city, Qyburn is visibly awestruck by its splendor.[4]
            Cersei has a gilded prosthetic hand forged for Jaime, and Qyburn personally fits it on him. Cersei voices her gratitude to Qyburn, who then ingratiates himself with the Queen by aiding her in other matters.[5]
            After Gregor Clegane is seriously wounded during his fight against Oberyn Martell, Qyburn and Pycelle theorize that Oberyn had coated his spear in manticore venom, causing Clegane's wounds to fester and leave him in agony. Pycelle tells Cersei that Clegane is likely doomed, but Qyburn states that he may be able to save him using more unorthodox means, even though Clegane once nearly killed him in Harrenhal. Pycelle snorts that Qyburn is not even a Maester and reminds Cersei that he was expelled from the Citadel for conducting "dangerous" and "unnatural" experiments. Cersei, remembering Qyburn's success with Jaime's stump, responds by dismissing Pycelle from his duties - and his laboratory. Cersei then gives Qyburn permission to do anything he can to save Clegane and to come to her should he need anything. Qyburn warns the Queen that the process he intends to put Ser Gregor through may "change him", but when she is satisfied that it will not affect his strength, she instructs Qyburn to carry on.[6]
            Qyburn is at Cersei's side when she confirms that a head brought to her by two bounty hunters does not belong to her brother Tyrion Lannister. Qyburn asks for the head for use in his research.[7] Later on, at a meeting of the Small Council, Cersei appoints Qyburn as the new Master of Whisperers to replace Varys. Grand Maester Pycelle protests vehemently given Qyburn's outcast status, and Kevan Lannister denounces Qyburn as a sycophant and Cersei as a power-grabber.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Qyburn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascQyburn</string></dict>
        <key>Kevan Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.25.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Kevan Lannister was the younger brother of Lord Tywin Lannister and one of his most loyal and trusted officers in the Lannister armies during the War of the Five Kings.
            After his brother's death at the hands of his nephew Tyrion, Kevan opposes his niece Cersei's seizure of power as leader of her son King Tommen's Small Council. Refusing his appointment by Cersei as Master of War, he departs the court in protest and returns to Casterly Rock.
            When Cersei is arrested on various charges by the Faith Militant, Kevan returns to King's Landing and is appointed Hand of the King by Grand Maester Pycelle, until he is killed in the Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, arranged by Cersei herself.
            Kevan was the second son of the late Lord Tytos Lannister. He was the brother of Lord Tywin Lannister the head of House Lannister and Lord of Casterly Rock. Kevan was married to Dorna Lannister of House Swyft - who King Robert characterized as "a dumb whore with a fat arse" - and they had a son Lancel, who was a squire to King Robert Baratheon. He was a noted knight who served his elder brother loyally as an adviser, and was respected for his wise and candid counsel.[1]
            While talking with his mother on how to handle the North should the Iron Throne come into conflict with the Starks, Prince Joffrey muses on crushing the Northerners with a new "Royal Army" and giving Winterfell to his great-uncle Kevan to rule over but Cersei dismisses the plan as impractical. Kevan is also indirectly (and erroneously) accused of being a "half-wit with a stutter" by King Robert when he taunts Lancel about his alliterative name. Tyrion also refers to him while standing trial at the Eyrie, confessing that he "once put goat shit in his uncle's boots" as a prank.[2]
            Kevan is going over troop movements with his brother Tywin in their army's command tent when Tyrion enters, having escaped from his capture by Catelyn Stark, and with a makeshift army of hill tribesmen in tow. Kevan is pleasantly surprised to see Tyrion safe and free, though Tyrion's own father seems mildly disappointed at both prospects. Kevan explains that Jaime crushed the Tully army at the Battle of the Golden Tooth and is laying siege to Riverrun. Tyrion wonders how King Robert would allow this, but Tywin explains that Robert is dead and Eddard Stark imprisoned. A messenger then arrives saying that Robb Stark's army has passed south of the Neck. Tywin orders Kevan to have the drummers signal the army to assemble to march, and to send word to Jaime that their army will be moving against Robb.[3]
            Kevan is later part of Tywin's pre-battle strategy meeting, in which Tywin declares that Tyrion and his hill tribe allies will be in the vanguard. Tyrion balks at this, not only because it will put him in the greatest danger, but because the hill tribes are inexperienced at pitched battle. Kevan tries to console his nephew that the hill tribes do seem to be rather ferocious, and should be up for it. Kevan takes part in the following Battle of the Green Fork, and Tywin's army is victorious. Even Tyrion and his hill tribes did fairly well. It turns out, however, that this was simply a diversionary force so Robb could use the bulk of his army to ambush the western half of the Lannister army under Jaime at Riverrun.[4]
            Following the Lannister defeat at the Battle of the Whispering Wood and the capture of Jaime, Kevan joins Tywin's council as they discuss their next move. Kevan points out that with the Starks attacking from the north and both of Robert Baratheon's brothers attacking in southern Westeros, they are facing a war on two fronts. With half of their armies destroyed, Kevan asks if they should consider negotiating with Robb Stark for peace. Tyrion bluntly points out that all chance for a negotiated peace died with Robb's father Eddard, whom Joffrey petulantly had executed. Tywin angrily orders everyone out, except for Tyrion. He agrees that they could have negotiated if Eddard was still alive, but now they cannot hold their position, so he and Kevan will lead their remaining army-group south to regroup at Harrenhal.[5]
            Ser Kevan is present at a war council held at Tywin's chambers at Harrenhal; he predicts that King’s Landing will fall an hour after King Stannis Baratheon's forces arrive. Kevan counsels Tywin to order Cersei and her family to flee to the safety of Casterly Rock. Tywin balks at surrendering the Iron Throne. Kevan argues that giving up the throne is better than seeing the heads of their relatives mounted on the city gates, fearing that Stannis will execute any Lannister he finds in the city. Tywin rejects the suggestion, believing that a king who runs cannot remain king for long.
            Tywin complains that Stannis is just two days from King's Landing while Robb Stark is on their doorstep in the Westerlands. Kevan reports word from their scouts that Robb remains north of Ashemark. Tywin laughs derisively and says that the last time their scouts assured them of Robb's movements they were lured into a trap. Tywin blames their poor intelligence for the capture of Jaime. Tywin asserts that Robb has gotten too close to Casterly Rock. Kevan relays news that Robb has sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell and theorizes that the Greyjoys' seizure of the castle is a boon to them because Robb will not march against Casterly Rock until he is at full strength. Tywin dismisses the suggestion and opts to march on the Westerlands, leaving the defense of the capital to his allies.[6]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Kevan_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascKevanLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Ilyn Payne</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.26.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Ilyn Payne is a mute knight and the King's Justice, the royal executioner, to Robert Baratheon and his successor Joffrey Baratheon. He executed Eddard Stark for treason on Joffrey's orders.
            Ser Ilyn Payne had his tongue removed on the order of the Mad King for suggesting that Tywin Lannister, then Hand of the King and whom Ser Ilyn served as Captain of the Guards, was the true ruler of Westeros rather than King Aerys II. He served Robert Baratheon as "the King's Justice" - the royal executioner.[1]
            Sansa Stark encounters Ilyn while out walking as they are traveling with the king's procession back to King's Landing, and is startled by his appearance. Sansa apologizes to Ilyn for possibly offending him, but receives no reply. Sandor Clegane informs her that Ilyn had his tongue removed years ago by the Mad King and now serves as the king's executioner.
            Ilyn is later ordered to kill Sansa's direwolf Lady by Queen Cersei as revenge for her sister Nymeria (who acted in defense of Arya Stark) attacking Joffrey Baratheon. Eddard Stark insists on carrying out the sentence himself instead.[2] Following the death of King Robert I in a hunting accident, Ilyn serves King Joffrey I.[3]
            Eddard is led before the people outside the Great Sept of Baelor and confesses to treason. Joffrey tells the crowd that both his Lady Sansa and his mother Cersei have asked that Ned be sent to Castle Black as a punishment. To the surprise of all, however, Joffrey suddenly proclaims that they have the soft hearts of women, and promises that, during his reign, treason will be punished: he orders Ilyn to bring him Ned's head. Ilyn takes House Stark's ancestral sword, Ice, and beheads Ned with one swift stroke.[4]
            Marillion is brought before Joffrey because he wrote a song mocking King Robert and Queen Cersei. As a punishment, Joffrey orders Ser Ilyn Payne to (ironically) cut out Marillion's tongue.[5]
            Ilyn Payne's unhesitating obedience in carrying out Joffrey's order to execute Eddard Stark is not without repercussions. When Tyrion Lannister arrives in the capital city, sent by his father Tywin to rein in Joffrey's erratic behavior, he confronts his sister Cersei over her defense that she "tried to stop" Eddard's execution. Tyrion bluntly points out Joffrey wasn't the one holding the sword, yet both Cersei and Ser Ilyn simply went along with the boy-king's orders, when they could have easily just stopped what they were doing.[6]
            Ilyn's execution of Ned Stark earns him a place on Arya's death list that she recites each night before she sleeps.[7]
            Ser Ilyn continues to serve King Joffrey as the War of the Five Kings ravages Westeros. During the Battle of the Blackwater, Ser Ilyn accompanies Queen Cersei to Maegor's Holdfast. Though the Queen claims Ser Ilyn is present to protect them and to deal with potential betrayers, she later admits to Sansa that Ilyn's true purpose is to execute her and Sansa, and possibly the rest of the ladies who have taken refuge in the holdfast, should Stannis Baratheon take the city.[8]
            When Tyrion Lannister confronts his father on the night before his scheduled execution, Tywin assures his son he won't let Ilyn Payne take his head.[9]
            Illyn Payne is a stern, grim and brooding man due to having lost his tongue and his ability to speak, he is constantly expressionless and almost never emotes aloud. Even so, numerous of individuals claim that he lives only to kill on the King's word and deeply enjoys his work as executioner. More specifically Ilyn enjoys ironic punishments given to him by the King or will find other ways to sadistically add insult to injury towards the person he is about to either kill or maim. For example he beheads Eddard Stark with Ice, his own sword which had been passed down by House Stark's ancestry and when about to cut the tongue out of Marillion, Joffrey states there was no one more suited to perform such a task. Illyn is also one of the few people who scares the Hound, a seasoned barbaric and fearless warrior.
            On January 9, 2013 actor Wilko Johnson announced that he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer of the pancreas.[10] Though he initially refused treatment, he underwent a successful tumour-removal operation in 2014.[11]
            Johnson's declining health has apparently led to him being gradually phased out of the TV series. He only appeared in one episode of Season 2 ("Blackwater"), and did not appear in Season 3 at all. Then again, Ser Ilyn did not prominently appear in the first half of the third novel either (which was adapted as Season 3). (On the other hand, Ser Ilyn's most important role in Season Four was instead given to Bronn.) Given that Ser Ilyn cannot speak or convey his thoughts through writing, he does not have a particularly major presence in the storyline, but he is usually seen hovering around in the background at Joffrey's royal court.
            Tywin's dialogue in "The Children" confirms that the character is still alive and active.
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ilyn Payne served as Lord Tywin Lannister's captain of household guards when Tywin served Aerys II Targaryen as the Hand of the King. After being heard to joke that it was Tywin who truly ruled the Seven Kingdoms, King Aerys ordered Payne's tongue be removed with hot pincers. Even though he was high in Tywin Lannister's service, Tywin Lannister couldn't stop the Mad King, and this was another step in the increasing tensions between the two which eventually led to Tywin's resignation. King Robert Baratheon named Ser Ilyn as King's Justice as a present to Tywin Lannister to compensate Payne for the loss of his tongue while in service to the Lannisters.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Ilyn_Payne</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascIlynPayne</string></dict>
        <key>Damien</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.27.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Damien was a guard commander for House Lannister in King's Landing.
            ​Later​, Damien ransacks Mira's chambers, going through her belongings before leaving a note on her bed, instructing her to meet with him in the gardens that night so that he may divulge critical information about Tyrion. After arriving at the meeting point, Mira is accosted by Lucan, a subordinate of Damien's, but Damien steps in and orders him to leave them be. Damien then reveals that Mira has made enemies with the wrong people, and attempts to stab her with a hidden dagger. After struggling with the handmaiden and trying to choke her, Damien is hit over the head with a piece of firewood by Tom the coal boy, causing Damien to turn his attention to Tom and try to drown him in a well.
            If Mira fled from Damien, Tom will reveal that he killed Damien with a rock and disposed of the body.
            Regardless of player action, the other Lannister guards become suspicious of Damien's disappearance, and begin questioning people. Lucan later recognizes Mira at the royal wedding, demanding to know what transpired in the garden. Before he can detain Mira, she is saved by Lord Morgryn.[2]
            While at Tommen's coronation feast, Mira can eavesdrop on a crowd of nobles, where they discuss how Damien was killed in the gardens, and how they haven't found the perpetrator, but not due to their lack of effort.[3]
            The Lannisters intensify their search for Damien's killer, breaking into Mira Forrester's room to search for evidence after rumors of her committing the crime start to circulate. Mira is forced to flee the Red Keep after losing Margaery Tyrell's protection, with Lannister guards in hot pursuit. Tom surrenders himself to the guards in order to give Mira time to escape.
            Mira later meets up with Lord Morgryn, who reveals that he was the one who hired Damien to kill her. Morgryn then delivers Mira to Lucan, who arrests her for the murder.
            Mira is placed in the Black Cells awaiting immediate execution for Damien's murder. Morgryn visits and offers to marrry her and get her out of the sentence. Should she agree, Tom will be executed instead.[4]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Damien</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascDamien</string></dict>
        <key>Jaime Lannister</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.28.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Jaime Lannister is the eldest son of Tywin, younger twin brother of Cersei, and older brother of Tyrion Lannister. He is involved in an incestuous relationship with Cersei, and unknown to most, the biological father of her three children, Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen.
            Jaime previously served in the Kingsguard of Aerys Targaryen, known as the Mad King, before infamously backstabbing him during the Sack of King's Landing, earning Jaime the nickname of the Kingslayer. He continued to serve in the Kingsguard of Robert Baratheon, and as Lord Commander for Robert's alleged sons Joffrey and Tommen. However, a confrontation with the Faith of the Seven led to his dismissal from the sworn order.
            With Cersei's ascension to the Iron Throne and in light of the death of their uncle, Ser Kevan Lannister, Jaime was appointed as the new commander of the Lannister armies. However, he left his position to honor and help the North face the White Walkers after he learned that Cersei and Euron Greyjoy plot to dishonor the truce between the Iron Throne and the alliance of House Targaryen and House Stark.
            Jaime is the eldest son of Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister. Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Jaime had great difficulty learning to read as a child because he transposed letters in his mind. Tywin sat with him through four hours a day practicing until he learned. Jaime resented being forced to spend so much time on reading.[1]
            Jaime is the older brother of Tyrion and the twin brother of Cersei. Their mother died giving birth to Tyrion. Due to his place in the Kingsguard, Jaime cannot inherit his father's lands or titles, making Tyrion his father's heir; a fact which vexes Tywin. Unlike Cersei and Tywin, Jaime always treated Tyrion with a degree of kindness and respect.
            Jaime began in incestuous relationship with his twin Cersei in his youth. At the age of 16, Jaime rose to the rank of knighthood. At the behest of Cersei, he consented to join the Kingsguard so that the two of them could be together in King's Landing. However, Tywin erupted in fury and resigned his position as Hand of the King, taking Cersei back to Casterly Rock with him. Jaime was appointed to the position by the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen during the Tourney at Harrenhal.[2] He was then the youngest man ever appointed to its membership.[3]
            At the conclusion of Robert's Rebellion, Jaime's father Tywin arrived at the gates of King's Landing with the main Lannister army, pledging his allegiance. Most of the Small Council urged Aerys not to trust Tywin, especially Jaime, knowing his father would never support the losing side of a war. Instead, Grand Maester Pycelle gave the opposite counsel, and once the Lannister army was allowed inside, Tywin ordered his men to attack the city. As Lannister soldiers raped and pillaged throughout the city during the Sack of King's Landing, King Aerys remained holed up inside the Red Keep, for hours maniacally repeating the order to "burn them all". Despite being sworn by the holiest oaths to protect the king as a member of the Kingsguard, Jaime ultimately turned his own sword on Aerys, slaying him at the foot of the Iron Throne itself. For this infamous act, he is known throughout the Seven Kingdoms as the "Kingslayer", to his irritation.
            In King's Landing, Jaime counsels his sister, Cersei, over fears that Jon Arryn may have discovered their secret prior to his death. Jaime argues that even if he knew, Arryn did not inform the king, for if he had, they would already be dead. If Arryn knew, his knowledge died with him. He accompanies King Robert to Winterfell where the king plans to ask Eddard Stark to replace Jon Arryn as Hand of the King. After their arrival, Cersei sends Jaime to find their younger brother Tyrion. Jaime tracks Tyrion to a brothel, tells him that he is needed at the feast that night and brings him several whores to speed his exit.[6]
            At the evening feast, Jaime blocks Eddard's path and asks if there will be a possibility of their competing against each other at a tournament. Eddard dismissively says no, as he doesn't play at fighting, and doesn't show off his skills to let opponents know his abilities. The next day, Eddard and Robert go hunting, leaving the castle largely empty. Cersei and Jaime liaise in a derelict tower. Bran Stark climbs the tower and finds them engaged in sexual intercourse. He is caught watching by Cersei, and Jaime grabs him. He looks out the window and only sees Bran's direwolf pup Summer. He asks Bran how old he is, and he replies, "Ten." Jaime glances momentarily back at Cersei and says, "The things I do for love", and pushes Bran out of the window.[6]
            Several days later at breakfast, Tyrion tells his family that Bran is expected to live and notes his sibling's guarded reactions to the news. Tyrion informs them of his decision to journey north to see the Wall before returning to King's Landing. Just before departing Winterfell, Jaime talks to Jon Snow in the courtyard.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jaime_Lannister</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascJaimeLannister</string></dict>
        <key>Bronn</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.29.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Bronn is a skilled and dangerous sellsword who comes to prominence when he champions for Tyrion Lannister in his trial by combat in the Eyrie. Bronn subsequently enters Tyrion's service as his bodyguard and enforcer.
            While Bronn begins as a common and obscure mercenary, over the course of the narrative his fortunes continue to gradually rise. Bronn is briefly appointed Commander of the City Watch in King's Landing when Tyrion is acting Hand of the King. He is then rewarded with a knighthood for the vital role he performed during the Battle of the Blackwater, taking on the formal name "Ser Bronn of the Blackwater." His status in Westerosi society rises even further when he is betrothed to Lollys Stokeworth, though the betrothal is annulled and he is sent to Dorne with Jaime Lannister to rescue Myrcella Baratheon from the vengeful family of Oberyn Martell. He is poisoned by Tyene Sand and almost dies, but survives and is allowed to leave Dorne. He later accompanies Jaime to Riverrun as part of a Lannister host. They take command of the Second Siege of Riverrun from the Freys, and succeed in getting Edmure Tully to surrender the castle. He and Jaime return to King's Landing in time to witness Cersei being crowned Queen. Later, Bronn assists Jaime, Randyll Tarly, and Dickon Tarly in leading the capture of Highgarden. On the way back to King's Landing, Bronn defends the Lannister convoy from a surprise attack by Daenerys Targaryen and her Dothraki, injuring Drogon, and ultimately saving Jaime from her dragon's wrath.
            Bronn is a sellsword; a mercenary soldier whose service as a warrior is for hire. Not much is known about his past or family. Both his parents beat him.
            At age 5, his nose was accidentally broken when his mother hit him with an iron poker; which she had meant for Bronn's younger brother. His nose was broken a second time at age 9, during a scrap with a few older boys and they won. It was also broken a third time, but the details are unknown.
            Bronn has also mentioned that he first found out that men void their bowels when they die when he was only 5 years old.[1]
            When Tyrion Lannister introduced him to Tywin Lannister, Bronn said that his father is no one Lord Tywin would know. During a drinking game with Tyrion and Shae, Bronn claims that he killed a woman before he was 12 years old, though it was in self-defense as she was attacking him with an axe. Bronn also confirmed Tyrion's claim that Bronn has been beyond the Wall. When asked why he was there, he bluntly answers that it was "work".[2]
            Bronn is staying at the Crossroads Inn when Tyrion Lannister arrives. He volunteers to give up his room to Tyrion in return for gold. Catelyn Stark and Ser Rodrik Cassel take Tyrion prisoner before he can fulfill the promise.[3] Bronn accompanies Catelyn and Tyrion's party to the Vale of Arryn and listens to Tyrion promising a handsome reward to any man who helps him. Along the way they are attacked by hill tribesmen, and Bronn holds his own in the skirmish, killing several opponents. Both Tyrion and Catelyn take note of his prowess in combat.[4]
            In the Eyrie Tyrion attempts to prove his innocence and demands a trial by combat. He desperately asks for someone to fight for him and, to the surprise of all, Bronn steps forward to accept. Bronn kills Lady Lysa Arryn's champion, Ser Vardis Egen, proving Tyrion's innocence according to Westerosi custom. Bronn defeats Vardis by relying on his speed against the armored but slow knight, and fights dirty by throwing obstacles in the way. Once Bronn has exhausted Vardis, he moves in for the kill, then throws his corpse out the Moon Door. Bronn then departs the Eyrie with Tyrion. Lady Lysa rages that Bronn does not fight honorably. Bronn nods in agreement, and wryly notes that Ser Vardis did.[5]
            During their crossing of the mountains, Bronn establishes some ground rules with Tyrion, stating that he is not Tyrion's friend or his sworn sword, and is only working for him for the money. Tyrion accepts the situation and promises to beat any attempt to buy Bronn's loyalty. Bronn and Tyrion camp in the Vale and are caught by Shagga and his Stone Crows. Bronn is prepared to fight but Tyrion wins over Shagga and the other hill tribes to his cause with promises of weapons and autonomy from the Eyrie.[6]
            Tyrion takes his growing entourage to the Lannister army's camp in the Riverlands. Tyrion's father Tywin invaded the Riverlands following Tyrion's capture because they are Catelyn's homeland. When Bronn is introduced to Tywin he quips that Tywin wouldn't have met his father, which Ser Kevan Lannister seems to find amusing but Tywin does not. Shagga demands that Tyrion fight alongside the hill tribes until his debt is paid and Tywin agrees.[6]
            Bronn finds Tyrion a whore named Shae amongst the camp-followers. The three of them play drinking games on the eve of the Battle of the Green Fork. Bronn reveals that his parents beat him, that he killed for the first time before the age of twelve (a woman who attacked him with an axe), and that he has been beyond the Wall. Bronn awakens to find the opposing army almost upon them. Bronn rouses Tyrion and advises him on how to survive. This proves unnecessary when Tyrion is accidentally knocked unconscious by his own men during the rush to the fight. When Tyrion awakens after the battle, Bronn glibly tells him that they won.[2] Bronn later accompanies Tyrion to King's Landing when he is named acting Hand of the King.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bronn</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascBronn</string></dict>
        <key>Addam Marbrand</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.03.0.30.03</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Ser Addam Marbrand is the heir of Lord Damon of House Marbrand and a bannerman of House Lannister.
            A messenger reports news from Ser Addam's outriders to Tywin Lannister. Ser Addam's scouts have noticed Robb Stark's forces have crossed the Neck and are moving south along the east bank of the Green Fork of the Trident.[1] Tywin's forces later engage and defeat the Stark force in the Battle of the Green Fork. The Stark army is much smaller than the scouts reported because they separated at the Twins.[2]
            Ser Addam is present for a strategy meeting with Tywin following the defeat in the Battle of the Whispering Wood by the main portion of the Stark army. Also present are Tyrion Lannister, Kevan Lannister, Leo Lefford, Harys Swyft and another bannerman, as well as Tywin's servant and several Lannister officers. He asks about Stannis and Renly Baratheon, and Kevan confirms that both Baratheon brothers have declared against the Lannisters. Later he dismisses suing for a truce so as to not appear weak, and proposes that they march against the Starks instead. Tywin dismisses his bannermen and then announces plans to relocate to Harrenhal.[3]
            In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Addam Marbrand is the most aggressive of the Lannister bannermen at the meeting and decries the idea of a truce. However, Marbrand is the same age as Ser Jaime Lannister and has long red hair and wears a smoke grey cape.
            During his youth, Addam was a page at Casterly Rock and a childhood friend of Jaime Lannister.
            Ser Addam is one of Tywin's bannermen present at Harrenhal and departs the ruined castle a day before his liege lord. He survives the Battle of the Fords and joins Tywin in the march south when the latter receives word of Stannis Baratheon's imminent attack. After the Battle of the Blackwater, Addam is made Commander of the City Watch.
            After Jaime returns to King's Landing, he practices with Addam for a while, but fearing that Addam may get drunk and reveal what poor fighter Jaime is now, he moves to practice with Ilyn Payne.
            Addam accompanies Jaime in his mission to resolve the siege of Riverrun. He is quite content to leave the City Watch and command the outriders.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Addam_Marbrand</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionGOTLannisterMascAddamMarbrand</string></dict>
