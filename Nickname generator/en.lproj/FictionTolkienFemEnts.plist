The pair were beloved since before even Morgoth first arose in power during the youth of the world. Translated, her name meant, according to the 1966 Index, 'slim-birch' (according to Appendix F, 'slender-beech'). As with all of the other Entwives, Fimbrethil had been missing since Sauron's forces destroyed the gardens of the Entwives during the Second Age. At the time of the War of the Ring, Treebeard had not seen his beloved Fimbrethil for over 3,000 years.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Fimbrethil</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionTolkienEntsFemFimbrethil</string></dict>
