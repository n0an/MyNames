        <key>Vandar Tokare</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.1.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Vandar Tokare was a male Jedi Master of Yoda's species who was the head of the Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council during the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War, holding a seat on both the Jedi High Council and the Council of the Jedi academy during this time span. He was friends with fellow Council member Vrook Lamar, usually having the last word in their frequent disagreements, most notably on the choice to train Revan once again in the ways of the Jedi after his fall to the dark side of the Force. During the Conclave at Katarr, Tokare was killed along with many survivors of the First Jedi Purge and the entire Miraluka colony after the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus drained the Force from the planet's surface.
            Tokare took Derrica Praji and another person as Jedi Padawans and trained them on Ossus. In 4225 BBY Tokare and his two apprentices traveled to the world Kaikielius, where they led Galactic Republic troops during the Kaikieli Reconquista, a campaign to retake Kaikielius from criminals. For three months, Tokare led attacks on most criminal-infested cities and was eventually victorious.[1]
            Prior to the Mandalorian Wars, Tokare had a conversation with Vrook Lamar concerning Meetra Surik. She had yet to achieve the title of Jedi Knight, but a Master had already been assigned to her, and her talent with Force bonding had already begun to manifest itself. Master Lamar had low views on anyone who followed Revan, but even before the war, he deemed Surik a mediocre Jedi and believed her talent was uncontrolled because of lust for power, and that it would eventually lead her to the dark side. When he caught Surik in a heated argument with his Padawan, Lamar first asked her Master to lecture her about discipline, without success, then he expected Master Tokare to step in, but he wouldn't either. Though respecting Lamar's wisdom, Tokare told him that it was not his concern, and he voiced a divergent opinion on Surik, whom he saw as a natural leader with a unique strength. This conversation was recorded by a protocol droid serving at the Jedi Enclave. Years later, in 3951 BBY, for the first time since she went to war, Surik would return to Dantooine. She met this droid in a battered state, its memory banks corrupted, but after indulging in some maintenance, she found a partially degraded holorecord of Lamar and Tokare speaking about her.[2]
            In the years leading up to the Mandalorian invasion of the Galactic Republic during the Mandalorian Wars, Master Tokare taught many pupils, and by 3964 BBY he was the leading Master of the Jedi Enclave. Zayne Carrick, who had been a student of his before being apprenticed to Lucien Draay, sought the help of Master Tokare in the wake of the Padawan Massacre of Taris, for which he had been framed. The fugitive Padawan contacted him from The Last Resort and disclosed the details of what occurred in the Jedi Tower when his fellow students Shad Jelavan, Kamlin, Oojoh, and Gharn were all killed during their Knighting ceremony.[3]
            Distraught, Tokare asked him how could he have murdered those he grew up with. Carrick tried to explain that he barely escaped the same fate, as he was chased by those he found standing among their corpses with their lightsabers drawn, their own teachers, Jedi Masters Feln, Q'Anilia, Raana Tey, Xamar, and Draay himself. But Tokare found hard to even contemplate that Draay, who was the scion of an important family, both in the Republic and in the Jedi Order, could be responsible for such a thing. Instead, he pondered aloud if Carrick himself may have committed the crime, and subconsciously erased it from his mind.[3]
            When Carrick called the Enclave, Tokare was in a meeting with fellow Council members Zhar Lestin, Lamar, and Bala Nisi. He asked Lestin about any Jedi Consulars serving on Taris and was surprised to hear that, save Draay, all Jedi stationed there were Consulars, which was unusual. Nevertheless, he told Carrick that if he turned himself in, one of those Jedi could probe his mind and help him find the truth. Just as Carrick pointed out that those were the ones trying to kill him, the transmission got cut by Jarael, who struck Carrick from behind and knocked him unconscious.[3]
            Within weeks since the murders, Carrick decided to turn himself in so as to relieve his new companions of the trouble he had brought upon them. In the Council chamber of the Jedi Enclave, Tokare watched him on a news hologram as he was brought in chains to the Jedi Tower. However, before he could be killed by Draay, Carrick was rescued by Jarael and escaped once again. The Masters of Taris was then contacted by the Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council and recalled to Coruscant to explain themselves.[4] As they stood awaiting the High Council’s judgment, a stern Vrook Lamar would reprimand the five for allowing the deaths of their students, and he would remind them of a recurrent counsel of Tokare's about being protectors as much as teachers. Master Tokare instead regretted he did not listen to Lamar's counsel when he assigned students to then-uneager teachers, feeling now that perhaps that reluctance was, in fact, wisdom.[5]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vandar_Tokare</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsYodaMascVandarTokare</string></dict>
        <key>Oteg</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.2.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Oteg was a revered male Jedi Master and Fleet Admiral who served the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic during the Great Galactic War and the ensuing Cold War. Oteg commanded the Republic's First Expeditionary Fleet who fought during the Cold War and the Galactic War against the Sith Empire.
            A Force-sensitive member of a long-lived species, Oteg was educated in the ways of the Force by the Jedi Order two centuries before the start of the Great Galactic War. Earning the rank of Jedi Master, Oteg was serving aboard the Republic starship Sarapin Wanderer during the Great Galactic War with the resurgent Sith Empire when it was attacked and its captain killed. Taking command and organizing a counterattack, Oteg proved his prowess in warfare when he drove the Imperial fleet into a nearby nebula and tricked them into detonating the gases of the nebula to destroy the fleet.[3]
            Upon returning to Republic space after the Treaty of Coruscant went into effect, Oteg was appointed to the Jedi High Council and would aid in leading the Order until the peace brought on by the treaty began to erode. As conflicts began to shatter the peace, Supreme Chancellor Dorian Janarus recommended that Oteg fill the role of Fleet Admiral. With the approval of Grand Master Satele Shan, Oteg left the Council and took command of the first expeditionary fleet from the bridge of the Republic dreadnought Telos.[3]
            During the war he summoned an elite four man strike team to converse with the Force ghost of Meetra Surik, telling them of a Jedi Master held prisoner by the Sith Empire. He directed the ensuing operation to obtain the means to liberate the Jedi Master—later revealed to be the legendary Revan—which involved obtaining a Gree key. Once the computer had been obtained, the Jedi Master went on to command the fleet into the Maelstrom and engage the Imperial Fifth Fleet under Grand Moff Rycus Kilran, stationed at the prison facility. Being cornered by both the Imperial fleet and the station's weaponry, he would communicate to the Republic strike team inside the station and informing them of the situation, they would tell him to pull back in effect saving Oteg's life and the flagship while they freed Revan. After Revan's rescue, Master Oteg welcomed him aboard the Telos.[2]
            Oteg was voiced by Jim Cummings.
            If the player chooses the dark side option in the Maelstrom Prison flashpoint, Oteg dies as the bridge of the Telos is destroyed.</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Oteg</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsYodaMascOteg</string></dict>
        <key>Yoda</key><dict><key>nameID</key><string>02.04.0.3.04</string><key>nameDescription</key><string>Yoda, a Force-sensitive male being belonging to a mysterious species, was a legendary Jedi Master who witnessed the rise and fall of the Galactic Republic, followed by the rise of the Galactic Empire. Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and power, Yoda trained generations of Jedi, ultimately serving as the Grand Master of the Jedi Order. Having lived through nine centuries of galactic history, he played integral roles in the Clone Wars, the rebirth of the Jedi through Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality.
            Born in 896 BBY, Yoda was almost nine hundred years old in the latter days of the Republic. A leading member of the Jedi High Council, his contemporaries included other legendary Masters such as Mace Windu and Ki-Adi-Mundi. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, the maverick Qui-Gon Jinn introduced Anakin Skywalker to the High Council, believing with absolute certainty that he had discovered the prophesied Chosen One. The Jedi elders sensed that the boy was full of fear and anger and declined to train him, deeming Skywalker too old and emotionally compromised to commit himself to the Jedi Code. After Jinn's death during the liberation of Naboo, the High Council reversed their decision in spite of Yoda's continued opposition to Skywalker's apprenticeship, having sensed grave danger in his training. At the same time, the Jedi discovered that their ancient nemesis, the Sith, had returned after a millennium in hiding. Aware of the Rule of Two, Yoda was convinced that at least one more Sith Lord remained active following Obi-Wan Kenobi's victory over the Sith apprentice Darth Maul.
            Over the next decade, the galaxy was on the verge of civil war with entire star systems—led by Count Dooku, Yoda's one-time Padawan—threatening to secede from the Republic by 22 BBY. Unable to defend the entire Republic on their own, the Jedi took command of the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic, with Yoda himself leading an army of clone troopers against the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the first battle of the Clone Wars. For three years Yoda led the Republic military's war effort as a Jedi General, determined to bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict, but his efforts were undermined by Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who conspired to destroy the Jedi and restore the Sith to power. After the Jedi Purge commenced in 19 BBY, killing thousands of Jedi both on Coruscant and across the galaxy, Yoda confronted the self-declared Galactic Emperor but failed to cut short Sidious' reign and consequently retreated into exile, leaving the Sith Master to consolidate his power with a new apprentice, the former Anakin Skywalker-turned-Darth Vader, at his side. His remaining years were spent living in isolation on the remote world of Dagobah until Anakin's son, Luke Skywalker sought out the legendary Grand Master in the hope of becoming a Jedi Knight. A year later, with his health rapidly declining, Yoda died of old age and became one with the Force in 4 ABY.
            Born 900 years before the Battle of Endor,[1] Yoda belonged to an ancient and mysterious species.[3] As he was keenly attuned to the Force, he joined the Jedi Order as a youngling. After undergoing the ritual known as the Gathering, he received his kyber crystal, and Professor Huyang helped him construct his first lightsaber aboard the Crucible.[13][14] Thereafter, Yoda was paired up with a personal mentor. During their time together, Yoda's Jedi Master told him the tale of K'ungfu and Chuang, two great Jedi of the past.[4] Around the age of 100, Yoda was ready to pass on what he had learned. Having attained the rank of Master, he spent the next eight centuries training and tutoring generations of Jedi.[2] It was estimated that over his lifetime, he trained around 20,000 Jedi.[15]
            Centuries later, Yoda took on the human Dooku as his last known padawan in the era of the Galactic Republic.[10] During one mission to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk, the padawan witnessed his master face off with a giant, dreadful terentatek.[16]
            Yoda visited Kashyyyk on several other occasions prior to the Battle of Kashyyyk, serving as Jedi negotiator in many incidents involving the Wookiees and their Trandoshan neighbors. This earned him the ancient title of "Defender of the Home Tree", as well as becoming a member of many Wookiee leaders' and all the inhabitants of Kachirho's honour families.[17]
            Yoda also taught outside the Master/Padawan relationship, and trained all the Jedi younglings prior to their teaming up with Jedi Masters,[18] including Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.[19] Kanan Jarrus, as Caleb Dume, often heard Yoda counsel "Do, or do not. There is no try."[20] He also taught groups of younglings in the basics of Jedi training, including lightsaber instruction.[10][21]
            During the invasion of the planet Naboo by the Trade Federation, Yoda served on the Jedi Council[7] as the Grand Master of the Jedi Order, having trained Jedi students for about 800 years.[2] He was present when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn presented Anakin Skywalker, a young slave boy from the planet Tatooine, to the Council in the hopes of training him. Although Jinn believed Skywalker to be the Chosen One, prophesized to bring balance to the Force, Yoda and the other Council members did not share his opinion, sensing that the boy was harboring a high amount of fear and his future was uncertain. They therefore refused to allow for his training.[7]</string><key>nameURL</key><string>https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yoda</string><key>nameImageName</key><string>FictionStarwarsYodaMascYoda</string></dict>
